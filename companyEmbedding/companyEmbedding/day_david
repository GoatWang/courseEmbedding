5.0 out of 5 starsYes, this book made me cry. I still loved it.ByLarry Hofferon August 12, 2012My name is Larry Hoffer and I am an absolute sap. Seriously. I get teary-eyed when people win sports championships or awards; even some songs and television commercials make me cry. And so while it shouldn't come as a complete surprise to me, David Nicholls' terrific book, One Day made me sob. I mean, I came completely unhinged. Egads.Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in Edinburgh. Dexter is good-looking, popular and privileged, fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him; Emma, of middle class origins, considers herself to be a bit non-conformist, although she has had a bit of a crush on Dexter throughout college. They nearly sleep together, but spend about a day and a half in each other's company. And this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly 20 years. One Day follows the peaks and valleys of Dexter and Emma's relationship on the same day--July 15--each year. Sometimes they're close friends; sometimes they're not. Sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isn't. Sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles. One of the characters refers to Emma and Dexter as "Harry and Sally," and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs. But the book is funny, thought-provoking, emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time, especially if you're a sap.This is a book about love, in many forms--friendship, romance, sexual attraction, marriage, parent/child relationships, unrequited crushes, etc. As Emma says at one point, "Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance." The book may be a bit predictable at times, and sometimes the characters aren't completely likeable, but I found this tremendously compelling and gripping. It has been optioned into a movie, and as much as I hate most film adaptations of books I love, I will definitely need to see this one, because much as its main characters felt about each other, this book has gotten hold of my heart. If you're a romantic--or just a sap like me--read this book.

3.0 out of 5 starsA tale of longing & loneliness cleverly disguised as a story of love & friendship.  Not at all what I expected.ByNicole D.on April 1, 2016Last year, I got hooked on listening to audiobooks during my commute.  So, I've been trolling Amazon for "reading" material ever since.  I had remembered seeing the trailer for One Day when it came out a few years back as a movie starring Anne Hathaway.  I recalled that it looked sweet and that I wanted to see it at the time.  I never did, needless to say, or I probably wouldn't have bought the audiobook.Anyway, this was not at all what I expected.  The format is pretty unique.  The author (David Nicholls) gives you a snapshot of the two lead characters - Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley - on a single day each year for about a 20-year period.  It's interesting to see where they are in life - with each other, other friends, family, careers, other relationships, etc.  I was very quickly drawn to the unconventional, but very sweet bond that Em & Dex seemed to have with one another.  I think this was one thing that really had me hooked early on.I actually quite liked the audiobook for the first several discs I listened to (it's something like 16 hours in total for the unabridged version).  Nicholls does a great job giving the characters wit, charm and personality.  I was very quickly hooked on the story and practically looked for excuses to run to the store or go out to pick up dinner so I could listen!  That's kind of pathetic, I know.  I was not quite halfway done with the audiobook when I decided I couldn't wait to spend 8-10 more hours in the car before knowing what happened.  So, I decided to rent the movie to watch on a lazy weekend day.  This was both a terrible mistake and a great idea.  On one hand, I was quite impressed at how closely the movie stayed with the book.  That rarely happens, but there were only two small parts that I noticed that had changed only slightly.  And, I mean these were VERY MINOR parts.  Of course, the movie had to cut out about 2/3 of the book which really diluted the quality; but overall it was a pretty close depiction of what Nicholls put on paper.  I was NOT EXPECTING what happens toward the last couple sections of the book.  I was glad that I watched the movie, because I may have actually wrecked my car if I'd heard that unexpectedly while driving.  Watching the movie also made me hate the story in a way, because it was not what I wanted or what I expected for these characters.  I almost didn't finish the audiobook, because I didn't want to waste my time building up to a conclusion that I hated.  But, I did.  It was just as depressing and upsetting as I had expected, but I was prepared for it.  So, that was good, I suppose.All in all, this is a book that I expected to be a sweet tale of friendship, love and relationships.  And, on the surface for the first 1/4 or so of the book, it seems to be just this.  BUT... given that the author is showing you a glimpse of their lives for ONE DAY a year for such a long period of time.  When you think of it, it really is a depressing tale of longing, loneliness and possibly a life wasted not going after what you truly want.  I prefer either horrible crime / mystery books or romantic love stories.  I don't like when the two intermix.  I'm not one to prefer a surprise ending to a book like this, but maybe that's just me.  David Nicholls, if you're reading this... you're an extremely talented writer.  But, DON'T EVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN!  :)To sum everything up... don't bother with the movie because it's depressing, leaves out way too much and it will probably leave you angry (like it did me!).  If you like a sweet story and don't mind some unexpected twists and turns, then you'll probably really like this book.  If you happen to do audiobooks, the narrator for this one is fantastic.  She speaks with an English accent, which was a little distracting for me at first only because I'm not used to hearing the accent.  But, after the first 10 minutes or so, all my thoughts were suddenly floating around my head with a charming little accent, and I was basically expecting everyone around me to sound like Kate Middleton when they spoke.  So, don't let that bother you.  I give the narrator huge props, though.  She does an amazing and seamless job swapping between all the different characters.  And, somehow, her male voices don't sound like a girl trying to speak in a man's voice.  They are VERY natural, which made for an amazing audiobook experience.I just finished this yesterday, so I still don't know how I feel about it.  I hated some of the things that happened, and was not pleased at all with the ending.  But, I was very delighted and entertained at many parts throughout.  So, if you're an avid reader and haven't picked this one up... maybe go for it?  If you prefer something more predictable and upbeat (i.e., without any depressing undertones), skip it.

I still loved it.ByLarry Hofferon August 12, 2012Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseMy name is Larry Hoffer and I am an absolute sap. Seriously. I get teary-eyed when people win sports championships or awards; even some songs and television commercials make me cry. And so while it shouldn't come as a complete surprise to me, David Nicholls' terrific book, One Day made me sob. I mean, I came completely unhinged. Egads.Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in Edinburgh. Dexter is good-looking, popular and privileged, fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him; Emma, of middle class origins, considers herself to be a bit non-conformist, although she has had a bit of a crush on Dexter throughout college. They nearly sleep together, but spend about a day and a half in each other's company. And this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly 20 years. One Day follows the peaks and valleys of Dexter and Emma's relationship on the same day--July 15--each year. Sometimes they're close friends; sometimes they're not. Sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isn't. Sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles. One of the characters refers to Emma and Dexter as "Harry and Sally," and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs. But the book is funny, thought-provoking, emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time, especially if you're a sap.This is a book about love, in many forms--friendship, romance, sexual attraction, marriage, parent/child relationships, unrequited crushes, etc. As Emma says at one point, "Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance." The book may be a bit predictable at times, and sometimes the characters aren't completely likeable, but I found this tremendously compelling and gripping. It has been optioned into a movie, and as much as I hate most film adaptations of books I love, I will definitely need to see this one, because much as its main characters felt about each other, this book has gotten hold of my heart. If you're a romantic--or just a sap like me--read this book.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsTwo people just fumbling through lifeByViola Chenon August 29, 2011Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseOn July 15, 1988, Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew spend the night together after their graduation from University. Their whole lives are ahead of them, lives full of potential, promise, and hope. Each chapter captures a snapshot of their lives on that day, St. Swithin's Day, each year for twenty years. Unfortunately, the significance of this day is completely lost on American readers. According to the folklore as stated on Wikipedia, whatever the weather is on St. Swithin's Day will continue for the next forty days. I suppose Groundhog's Day would be the American analogue. It's a day that symbolizes how life can swing in either direction - sunny or rainy, spring or winter.The appeal of this novel is its fresh and unique format - revisiting two people on the same day each year over twenty years. How would their lives change year to year? How would the characters develop over time? How would their relationship progress? And more interestingly, what kind of creative storytelling could the author accomplish?Aside from the format, it's surprisingly difficult to describe what this book is about. I've read reviews that characterize it as a love story; it is not. I've read reviews that liken it to "When Harry Met Sally", again it is not. If you go into this book with such notions, you'll be sorely disappointed. Yes, the novel has some romantic undertones but characterizing it as a love story will create certain expectations that may go unrealized. It's about two people, who happen to be friends, fumbling through their twenties and thirties. The author is quite good at portraying the simultaneous feelings of earnest hopefulness and terrifying aimlessness that characterizes the experience of many young adults today. Neither Emma nor Dexter knows what to do with the blank canvases that they were given. They don't seem to know what they want out of life, whether that is on a professional level or on a personal level.Nicholls gives us a great set up. Emma Morley is a smart, idealistic girl from a working-class family who isn't afraid to boycott or protest for certain causes. Dexter Mayhew is a privileged playboy who parties just a little too much. Through their friendship, Emma always brings out the best in Dexter, but I'm not quite sure what he does for her. These initial character sketches are believable, realistic, and charming. However, as the novel progresses, the characters, especially Dexter, become tiresome. As a novel that relies so heavily on two people, it has no choice but to be a character-driven book. And unfortunately, it is the character development that is lacking in this book. To be fair, Emma's character undergoes a satisfactory transformation. It is Dexter's character that is dreadful. He is a good-looking, spoiled drunk with too much money on his hands. I get it, but then, I got tired of it. I kept waiting for Dexter to hit rock bottom so that he could rise. Instead, he just bounced around the bottom without ever redeeming himself. Many recent college graduates feel lost and without direction. I get that. But does it really take twenty years to get your act together? And even then, I'm not entirely convinced that Dexter ever did.The novel is easy to read; it doesn't take long to breeze through the chapters. The pacing is steady at a brisk medium speed. The author sometimes takes advantage of the format by building suspense about what might happen on the very next day, July 16th, only to jump ahead a full year in the following chapter. This is fun. Also, the dialogue between the two main characters is a pleasure to read. Their casual banter is playful and perfectly expresses their closeness, familiarity, and comfort with each other. Most of this book is funny and light while a few parts are serious and dark. All in all, it's not a bad book, it just could have been so much better.0Comment|

Dex and Emma. I loved the way this story explored the hesitations and galant ideas of post- university idealism, introduced humor, darkness, insight with a great tale that spans 20 years. I would given up on Dexter completely. Not pleased with the tragic parts of the novel, but the writing is superb.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA smart, funny, and realistic readByALRon August 26, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis was such a wonderful book, funny and meaningful and smart and emotional. A character-driven story about two people, Emma and Dexter, it focuses on their lives and relationship over a span of twenty years. The format was really original - each chapter taking place on July 15th of a particular year - and I thought that worked really well and set the story apart from other contemporary romances.What I liked most about it was how real the characters and the story felt. Emma and Dexter were flawed yet completely relatable, dealing with what ever life threw at them, sometimes with grace but most often by making mistakes and figuring things out the hard way, just like the rest of us. Their relationship was realistic, too, far from perfect yet always something I was rooting for. They are friends for most of the book, and despite their differences, worked well with each other. That being said, I do wish a little more time was spent on them when they were in a romantic relationship, because that was what I was waiting for the majority of the book.The writing was excellent, very insightful, perceptive, and usually humorous. The dialogue was also noteworthy, some of the best I've ever read.I don't like surprises, so I read spoilers about the ending, which I think helped me appreciate the book more. The ending was realistic, bittersweet, and I thought it fit in well with the overall tone of the book and what Nicholls was trying to get across. All in all, I definitely recommend this book!0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 starsGood writer, too into himselfByOdile Boyeton May 16, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseSo here's the thing, I only got a bit over 100 pages into this book and I had to quit.  David Nicholls has a knack, an incredible one, for painting a scene in a book that you can really see.  There are a few passages that just punch you in the face with their accuracy that you know you are seeing the exact thing the writer intended you to see.  Here's an example: "She had once studied fashion in London but these days ran a village antiques shop, selling expensive rugs and chandeliers to genteel Oxford with great success.  She still carried with her that aura of having been something-in-the-Sixties....but with no apparent sadness or regret she had given this up for a resolutely respectable, secure, comfortable family life."  Perfect, I get the complexity of this character and why (her past) immediately.  Good writing!Here's the problem with Nicholls.  He thinks he's good, or at least he understands he has some knack for distilling, and delivering, and he LOVES to pat himself on the back.  And the way it comes off in the book is this self-congratulatory overdone yuck.  Worse, the characters (at least in the first third of the book) HATE themselves.  They are borderline suicidal, I tell you.  And that's where he fails.  I think he's trying to catch teenage angst that never gets resolved and so evolves into twenty-something treading in bottomlessness.  But it comes off as this true self-loathing, that's so hard to understand (at least for the female character: she was top of her class more or less, and I get her anti-capatilst penchant, it makes sense why she gives up on her activism, but why does that translate to enjoying the self-fulfilling prophecy of picking a terrible fast food job and using it as proof that her dreams were always worthless?  And even if a natural course of failure, why does she revel in punishing herself?)Ever seen an actor get big and then s/he keeps winking at him/herself in their great acting in the next piece you see them in?  That's this book!  And I promise, I'm not an embittered reader who wants the magic of some past book to repeat itself, because I've never read anything else from this author!Please, do not torture yourself!  I want my $10 back!g0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsFalling in love in Cool BritanniaByLouis Fosteron December 24, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis is a tender, enjoyable and very contemporary love story which unfolds in England over the past twenty years. It begins in the early morning hours of July 15, 1988 when two just graduated students - idealistic and overachieving Emma Morley and wealthy, fun-loving Dexter Mayhew - who have met at a party and gone back to her flat spend a few hours chatting and then checks back in on the two characters each year on that date over the next twenty years before circling back to 1988 to relate how the two spent the rest of that first day together. The story is mostly about their friendship, it’s beginning in the informal, unstructured atmosphere of their college days, continuing on through letters, postcards, phone calls and meetings at friends’ weddings, until eventually they fall in love (or realize that they fell in love the day that they met, if you’re very romantic) and get married. The ‘one day’ narrative technique is a gimmick but it doesn’t come across that way. Instead, it’s a perfectly effective vehicle for describing both their relationship and how the two grow up throughout their twenties and thirties. Even though each chapter is limited to describing only one day, the important events in their lives which take place between the anniversary dates are discreetly filled in through subtle exposition. The novel is particularly strong in its dialogue which runs the gamut from college friends chatting aimlessly about their future plans or lack thereof to first date talk to the awkward conversations people have with alcoholics. Also of interest to the anglophilic is all of the references to British culture like ‘underground zone 2’ and the nostalgia for late twentieth century Britain, when it was known as Cool Britannia. (When Dexter falls on hard times after having been a successful TV personality, it is said that “even the guy who plays the congas in Jamiroquai doesn’t call him anymore.”) While it may not be the most profound love story ever told, it does achieve a bittersweet grace following a climactic tragedy and the story of these two lives is told with a light touch, humour and a good understanding of their time.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsNot The Usual Love StoryBynicoleon November 3, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseDavid Nicholls left me speechless after reading his spectacular novel, One Day. At the beginning of the book I thought of it as dull and boring, but it wasn't until the third or fourth chapter, which I became attached to it and didn't want to put the book down. One of my fellow book club members, had no interest in it at the beginning either, and eventually just gave up on reading it. However, I believe that they did not give it enough time whatsoever. The format I found to be odd, but I enjoyed it because it was something different and out of my comfort zone. I happened to think that it was like a camera, taking you through memories that have happened over the years. Each and every year on that same July 15th day, I was filled with laughter and interest. Nicholls, in my opinion, was very good with characterization. He picked a good storyline of these two characters, Dex and Emma, who are in love, but just wont ever admit it. I was filled with joy and excitement when they would see each other again, I felt as if they had a purpose and meaning to each other all the time whether they were together or not.As another review had said, this book will teach readers, "Live everyday like it's your last." In the end of this book, it really will affect the reader like it had done to myself. It took me a little to cope with the line that hit me hard with shock. The way it is written is very simple, but it also includes some British slang. Its simple to say that readers will either fall in love with this book like myself, or simply hate it and stop reading it after a few chapters, if lucky give it a few. This is a well written entertaining book filled with a mixture of feelings including sadness and humor that is worth spending your money on. It would be for someone who can take a frustrating story, one that does not go the way you want it to go at all times. Also, for one who can be prepared for a sad story because sadness sure does tie in. Anyone can really read this book; mainly women I would assume would enjoy reading this because it is a love story. This is a fantastic, heart-wrenching book, which is very real, and anyone would be missing out if they don't experience reading it.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Two ships passing in the night plots have rarely been done so well.  The fantastically frustrating characters captured my affection from the first day.  I was sucked into their world(s) and laughed and cried along with both Emma and Dexter, somehow aligning myself with both protagonists simultaneously...  Are there any shortcomings to this work?  Of course!  Would I have written a different ending?  Perhaps, but that would have ruined the book.  Highly recommended.I'm almost afraid to see the movie now, but I surely will.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsNot My Cup of Literary TeaBydebra crosbyon September 21, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis novel is clever and funny, in parts. However, I had problems with it. The first thing I noticed was (and this may just be in the Kindle edition, which I read) the use of "alright" instead of "all right" -- ALL the time! I mean, in the first chapter, "alright" was on almost every page. Did this guy not have a competent editor? I really dislike seeing errors like that, because they make me disrespect the writer and/or his editor. No excuse for that. What tore the rag off the bush, and when I quit reading, was when I saw "nauseous" used to mean "nauseated." Another egregious grammar error. No excuse for it, no matter how commonly this word is used incorrectly. The other problem I had with this book was that I really didn't care about either character and couldn't imagine in what universe they would possibly have had a relationship. I could see where Emma might be attracted to Dexter, since he was a good looking "bad boy," but he was an alcoholic, a cheater, and a reprobate. I can't imagine that Dexter could care about Emma, since he seemed to care so little for anyone else (except maybe his mother). This relationship just strained my ability to understand or accept it. There just wasn't much there, no depth, and that, coupled with the grammar errors, made me put this one down before I finished it. I read more than I really wanted to because it is a book club selection and I felt compelled to keep at it. But I have too many other books that I want to read, and not enough time to waste on stuff like this. Young people, and fans of romance novels, might love it. But if you're looking for good (or even decent) literature, I recommend that you skip this. Meh.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Fluorescent Gallery is very pleased to offer Light Panels representing the excellent work of acclaimed artist David Miller.
David’s talent as a colorist is exceptional. Certified for open water scuba, he has spent many hours diving in the beautiful waters of the Hawaiian Islands, Jamaica, California, and Mexico. Virtually all of his creations depict an aspect of the natural world. Along with his window to Paradise paintings, David is known for his brilliantly colored tropical fish, sea turtles, and most of all his dolphins and whales frolicking just below the surface of the deep, clean blue ocean in his “above and below” pieces.

Any acrylic thickness may be selected for your artwork of choice on common or smaller panel sizes. For oversize panels, the recommended thickness of material will be automatically selected at purchase, based on your size. Lowering the recommended thickness may result in obvious panel center sag.
Fluorescent Gallery acrylic options are available in the following thicknesses:
•  .060″ – Our standard white acrylic has a slight matte finish to allow the print to adhere nicely to each panel. Though it is our thinnest material, it is at least 30% thicker than many light panels found available for purchase elsewhere.
•  .080″ Lumieo – Normally for oversize lenses, this material is slightly less opaque than white, while still providing excellent light diffusion. It produces a beautiful result that is more durable than our .060″ acrylic.
•  .125″ Lumieo – A thicker version of our .080″. At 1/8 inch thick, this is the choice for the largest prints we offer, or for applications that benefit from a more rugged panel. Note: This thickness may not be flexible enough to bend into small fixtures.

Although a more costly option, Lumieo Acrylic offers enhanced features and benefits, such as greater light throughput and bulb hiding capabilities.

5.0 out of 5 starsYes, this book made me cry. I still loved it.ByLarry Hofferon August 12, 2012My name is Larry Hoffer and I am an absolute sap. Seriously. I get teary-eyed when people win sports championships or awards; even some songs and television commercials make me cry. And so while it shouldn't come as a complete surprise to me, David Nicholls' terrific book, One Day made me sob. I mean, I came completely unhinged. Egads.Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in Edinburgh. Dexter is good-looking, popular and privileged, fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him; Emma, of middle class origins, considers herself to be a bit non-conformist, although she has had a bit of a crush on Dexter throughout college. They nearly sleep together, but spend about a day and a half in each other's company. And this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly 20 years. One Day follows the peaks and valleys of Dexter and Emma's relationship on the same day--July 15--each year. Sometimes they're close friends; sometimes they're not. Sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isn't. Sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles. One of the characters refers to Emma and Dexter as "Harry and Sally," and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs. But the book is funny, thought-provoking, emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time, especially if you're a sap.This is a book about love, in many forms--friendship, romance, sexual attraction, marriage, parent/child relationships, unrequited crushes, etc. As Emma says at one point, "Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance." The book may be a bit predictable at times, and sometimes the characters aren't completely likeable, but I found this tremendously compelling and gripping. It has been optioned into a movie, and as much as I hate most film adaptations of books I love, I will definitely need to see this one, because much as its main characters felt about each other, this book has gotten hold of my heart. If you're a romantic--or just a sap like me--read this book.

3.0 out of 5 starsA tale of longing & loneliness cleverly disguised as a story of love & friendship.  Not at all what I expected.ByNicole D.on April 1, 2016Last year, I got hooked on listening to audiobooks during my commute.  So, I've been trolling Amazon for "reading" material ever since.  I had remembered seeing the trailer for One Day when it came out a few years back as a movie starring Anne Hathaway.  I recalled that it looked sweet and that I wanted to see it at the time.  I never did, needless to say, or I probably wouldn't have bought the audiobook.Anyway, this was not at all what I expected.  The format is pretty unique.  The author (David Nicholls) gives you a snapshot of the two lead characters - Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley - on a single day each year for about a 20-year period.  It's interesting to see where they are in life - with each other, other friends, family, careers, other relationships, etc.  I was very quickly drawn to the unconventional, but very sweet bond that Em & Dex seemed to have with one another.  I think this was one thing that really had me hooked early on.I actually quite liked the audiobook for the first several discs I listened to (it's something like 16 hours in total for the unabridged version).  Nicholls does a great job giving the characters wit, charm and personality.  I was very quickly hooked on the story and practically looked for excuses to run to the store or go out to pick up dinner so I could listen!  That's kind of pathetic, I know.  I was not quite halfway done with the audiobook when I decided I couldn't wait to spend 8-10 more hours in the car before knowing what happened.  So, I decided to rent the movie to watch on a lazy weekend day.  This was both a terrible mistake and a great idea.  On one hand, I was quite impressed at how closely the movie stayed with the book.  That rarely happens, but there were only two small parts that I noticed that had changed only slightly.  And, I mean these were VERY MINOR parts.  Of course, the movie had to cut out about 2/3 of the book which really diluted the quality; but overall it was a pretty close depiction of what Nicholls put on paper.  I was NOT EXPECTING what happens toward the last couple sections of the book.  I was glad that I watched the movie, because I may have actually wrecked my car if I'd heard that unexpectedly while driving.  Watching the movie also made me hate the story in a way, because it was not what I wanted or what I expected for these characters.  I almost didn't finish the audiobook, because I didn't want to waste my time building up to a conclusion that I hated.  But, I did.  It was just as depressing and upsetting as I had expected, but I was prepared for it.  So, that was good, I suppose.All in all, this is a book that I expected to be a sweet tale of friendship, love and relationships.  And, on the surface for the first 1/4 or so of the book, it seems to be just this.  BUT... given that the author is showing you a glimpse of their lives for ONE DAY a year for such a long period of time.  When you think of it, it really is a depressing tale of longing, loneliness and possibly a life wasted not going after what you truly want.  I prefer either horrible crime / mystery books or romantic love stories.  I don't like when the two intermix.  I'm not one to prefer a surprise ending to a book like this, but maybe that's just me.  David Nicholls, if you're reading this... you're an extremely talented writer.  But, DON'T EVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN!  :)To sum everything up... don't bother with the movie because it's depressing, leaves out way too much and it will probably leave you angry (like it did me!).  If you like a sweet story and don't mind some unexpected twists and turns, then you'll probably really like this book.  If you happen to do audiobooks, the narrator for this one is fantastic.  She speaks with an English accent, which was a little distracting for me at first only because I'm not used to hearing the accent.  But, after the first 10 minutes or so, all my thoughts were suddenly floating around my head with a charming little accent, and I was basically expecting everyone around me to sound like Kate Middleton when they spoke.  So, don't let that bother you.  I give the narrator huge props, though.  She does an amazing and seamless job swapping between all the different characters.  And, somehow, her male voices don't sound like a girl trying to speak in a man's voice.  They are VERY natural, which made for an amazing audiobook experience.I just finished this yesterday, so I still don't know how I feel about it.  I hated some of the things that happened, and was not pleased at all with the ending.  But, I was very delighted and entertained at many parts throughout.  So, if you're an avid reader and haven't picked this one up... maybe go for it?  If you prefer something more predictable and upbeat (i.e., without any depressing undertones), skip it.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsTwo people just fumbling through lifeByViola Chenon August 29, 2011Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseOn July 15, 1988, Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew spend the night together after their graduation from University. Their whole lives are ahead of them, lives full of potential, promise, and hope. Each chapter captures a snapshot of their lives on that day, St. Swithin's Day, each year for twenty years. Unfortunately, the significance of this day is completely lost on American readers. According to the folklore as stated on Wikipedia, whatever the weather is on St. Swithin's Day will continue for the next forty days. I suppose Groundhog's Day would be the American analogue. It's a day that symbolizes how life can swing in either direction - sunny or rainy, spring or winter.The appeal of this novel is its fresh and unique format - revisiting two people on the same day each year over twenty years. How would their lives change year to year? How would the characters develop over time? How would their relationship progress? And more interestingly, what kind of creative storytelling could the author accomplish?Aside from the format, it's surprisingly difficult to describe what this book is about. I've read reviews that characterize it as a love story; it is not. I've read reviews that liken it to "When Harry Met Sally", again it is not. If you go into this book with such notions, you'll be sorely disappointed. Yes, the novel has some romantic undertones but characterizing it as a love story will create certain expectations that may go unrealized. It's about two people, who happen to be friends, fumbling through their twenties and thirties. The author is quite good at portraying the simultaneous feelings of earnest hopefulness and terrifying aimlessness that characterizes the experience of many young adults today. Neither Emma nor Dexter knows what to do with the blank canvases that they were given. They don't seem to know what they want out of life, whether that is on a professional level or on a personal level.Nicholls gives us a great set up. Emma Morley is a smart, idealistic girl from a working-class family who isn't afraid to boycott or protest for certain causes. Dexter Mayhew is a privileged playboy who parties just a little too much. Through their friendship, Emma always brings out the best in Dexter, but I'm not quite sure what he does for her. These initial character sketches are believable, realistic, and charming. However, as the novel progresses, the characters, especially Dexter, become tiresome. As a novel that relies so heavily on two people, it has no choice but to be a character-driven book. And unfortunately, it is the character development that is lacking in this book. To be fair, Emma's character undergoes a satisfactory transformation. It is Dexter's character that is dreadful. He is a good-looking, spoiled drunk with too much money on his hands. I get it, but then, I got tired of it. I kept waiting for Dexter to hit rock bottom so that he could rise. Instead, he just bounced around the bottom without ever redeeming himself. Many recent college graduates feel lost and without direction. I get that. But does it really take twenty years to get your act together? And even then, I'm not entirely convinced that Dexter ever did.The novel is easy to read; it doesn't take long to breeze through the chapters. The pacing is steady at a brisk medium speed. The author sometimes takes advantage of the format by building suspense about what might happen on the very next day, July 16th, only to jump ahead a full year in the following chapter. This is fun. Also, the dialogue between the two main characters is a pleasure to read. Their casual banter is playful and perfectly expresses their closeness, familiarity, and comfort with each other. Most of this book is funny and light while a few parts are serious and dark. All in all, it's not a bad book, it just could have been so much better.0Comment|

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsNot My Cup of Literary TeaBydebra crosbyon September 21, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis novel is clever and funny, in parts. However, I had problems with it. The first thing I noticed was (and this may just be in the Kindle edition, which I read) the use of "alright" instead of "all right" -- ALL the time! I mean, in the first chapter, "alright" was on almost every page. Did this guy not have a competent editor? I really dislike seeing errors like that, because they make me disrespect the writer and/or his editor. No excuse for that. What tore the rag off the bush, and when I quit reading, was when I saw "nauseous" used to mean "nauseated." Another egregious grammar error. No excuse for it, no matter how commonly this word is used incorrectly. The other problem I had with this book was that I really didn't care about either character and couldn't imagine in what universe they would possibly have had a relationship. I could see where Emma might be attracted to Dexter, since he was a good looking "bad boy," but he was an alcoholic, a cheater, and a reprobate. I can't imagine that Dexter could care about Emma, since he seemed to care so little for anyone else (except maybe his mother). This relationship just strained my ability to understand or accept it. There just wasn't much there, no depth, and that, coupled with the grammar errors, made me put this one down before I finished it. I read more than I really wanted to because it is a book club selection and I felt compelled to keep at it. But I have too many other books that I want to read, and not enough time to waste on stuff like this. Young people, and fans of romance novels, might love it. But if you're looking for good (or even decent) literature, I recommend that you skip this.

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsIndecisiveBydr david picoon November 3, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseOne Day is the type of book that is either adored or despised, and I find myself completely torn in the middle. This book brought about many emotions; I found myself laughing at loud at times. I developed an attachment to the characters and became affected by the plot. Now and again, I found myself tearing up, and at one drastic point in the story I was unable to see the text through my tears. A few pages later, I was falling asleep due to boredom. The story was occasionally intense and gripping, and then Nicholls transitioned back into his unremarkable and tedious material. With all that in mind, this story brought about a great amount of joy and emotional pain simultaneously. I had split emotions while reading, and after finishing, have not yet settled on a definite outlook towards the novel. Putting my indecisive viewpoint aside, this book was definitely an impactful read. Nicholls puts a tasteful twist on the commonly recognized love story plot. The reader is presented with small glances into Emma and Dexter’s lives, realistically humorous and unpredictable. Just as the plot finally begins to quicken and develop, we are abruptly fast-forwarded a year into the future, commencing the next chapter. This writing style is undoubtedly unique, yet leaves countless unanswered questions. I am still unsure if Nicholls pulled it off, but in any case, One Day is a novel worth reading.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsDidn't love itByKindle Customeron December 21, 2012Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseFirst of all why is it $10 to buy for the Kindle when you can buy it used for $.01? But I digress...as noted the book tells the story of two characters on the same day each year, sometimes together and sometimes not.  She drove me nuts because she is so whiney and passive aggressive.  He is a slacker who life has just kind of worked out for.  Eventually she rises and he falls and they are able to meet as equals and that is when the story gets good but it was a long time coming to get there.  Wish I liked it more but not a waste of time...0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsA Day in the LifeByAmazon Customeron August 15, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAn easy read, good for summer. As has been noted the novel follows 2 people through 20 years on the same day - July 15th - each year. Emma develops well as a character, Dexter does not. Parts were trite and tedious, particularly Dexter's drug use and downward spiral, neither of which is given much thought or explanation; a convenient plot device, especially towards the end of the book where it just doesn't work. While I didn't necessarily want or think that the book should have had the perverbial happy ending, the ending it does have is trite and not particularly satisfactory. It's as if the author had nothing else for the characters to do or say to each other, or perhaps just got tired of the characters and couldn't figure out how to end, and so dispatches with one of them. I wanted to like Dex and Em, I wanted to be sympathetic and empathetic. In the end, neither could elicit the sentiment. The writing is charming, the diaglog witty and sharp, I just wish the characters and the book could have been a little more satisfying.0Comment|

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsNot What I Had Expected.....Bywomanreadingon March 20, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI loved the premise of this book - taking one day from different consecutive years to trace the always-developing relationship between the two main characters, Emma and Dexter.  Both have such well done back stories, personalities, and detailed lives that it seems entirely possible that you could encounter either one in RL. I had heard about the rave reviews and reception this book enjoyed in Europe, and I was eager to experience it for myself.  I read Emma and Dexter's growing interpersonal history with growing fascination.  However - no spoilers - the last portion of the book truly caught me by surprise, and it wasn't a pleasant surprise either.  For that reason, the novel left me with an unsavory aftertaste.  And so my planned "5 star review" dropped down to"3 stars".  Letdowns have a way of deflating the overall experience in memory.  I would recommend this book - but with a caution.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsBoring, but Held Me Till the EndByLelerzon January 10, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI picked up One Day because its a movie. I really Like Anne Hathaway's Charm and looking at the previews made me curious. But I drag my feet when it comes to TV/Movies... etc. Realizing it was a book I purchased it for my Kindle and all the way through I kept having this nagging feeling like "I am not sure if I like this book."When the accident happened I felt bad... not really for Dexter, but for Em. Throughout the story yeah She evolves into this individual... she's normal. She had huge youthful aspirations, none of which she could actually achieve at that point in her life anyway and fell into a place of "well this sucks-- now what?" And it seems like she drops to the bottom of the bottom when she dates a guy who we as the reader know is completely wrong for her (not that Dexter was that much better either).Dexter on the other hand had a silver spoon in his mouth and was stuck on himself. He just knew he had good looks, he just knew he had talent... as it was so greatly said about Dexter he had "it", whatever "it" is... And the worst part is he knew it.What held me captive was the waiting for when the two lost souls mature enough to a place where they are officially ready for one another. The whole book felt like the two were just never mature enough to handle each other one on one. And it never happens. Em was cast as a support beam placed in the slot which many women find themselves being if they are waiting for "I know he's Mr. Right, but he's got to come to his senses first." She has to put up with the bull and mess with a mop and bucket on the sidelines before being rewarded with the diamond.When Dex and Em do officially wind up together I was sorely disappointed. It seemed at this point the author realized "Well the story has gone on long enough and there's not much more I can do to keep these two apart. I used every plot device known to soap operas... I guess I can put them together now." It was rather painful, for lack of a better term at 240AM, to watch. It was kind of "Well I'm single now because my marriage failed and you're KIND of single.." "Oh I can't because I'm-Okay!"In the end Dex doesn't *really* some to his senses. He hasn't grown up really. He tempered down only because "someone in their mid thirties no longer has an excuse. In their twenties it 'oh i'm young'..." He had no choice but to try and relinquish and even when He loses Em for good he moves on with someone else to have filled her spot with a tiny bit of resistance. Bah!Perhaps I might've been satisfied with him remaining single because he developed some personal growth, but Dex is Dex... and is always with someone, never alone long enough to develop. Part of me even hoped that maybe years had gone by and he manages to remarry his first wife after they both changed into better people (Cuz they married under duress, really and both relatively immature about it)All in all, the writing was so-so. The character development was almost nonexistent... I was awfully disappointed and have grown less keen on watching the movie because I just don't see myself reliving this story. Sorry, I think this one is surely a swing and a miss.. SO why 3 stars? I actually finished it, didn't I?... there had to have been SOMETHING interesting about it.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsPretty Good, but not greatByPatricia Lauroon January 9, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI was really excited to read One Day and then watch the movie (which I still haven't gotten to), and, ultimately, the book was pretty good. Emma and Dex felt like real characters and real people who could actually exist. Now, living in America, there was a slight language barrier. The jokes and some of the terminology they used went over my head, but it didn't detract too much from the book. In the beginning, Emma and Dex meet and have a one night stand. After that, Nicchols begins describing their lives, on that same day July 15, every year after 1988. The banter the two have is quite witty, but the first few years Nicchols describes are too long. At the end of the book, the sections are very short, maybe even a little too short. But, because the beginning sections were so long, it almost felt like a relief. I read this with three other friends and we all had different opinions about Dex who we called a charmer, flirt, bastard, pig, sweet guy, well intentioned, lazy, etc. And Emma was smart, boring, unadventerous, not willing to take risks, sensible, "right" and many other things. It's a fun experience, but the beginning parts are lengthy. If you can get through them, it's a worthwhile read.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsIf you liked the Time Traveler's WifeBylizlizon June 30, 2016Format: Kindle Edition with Audio/Video|Verified PurchaseA well written, funny and engaging book for the most part, although I found the chapters set in their 20's dragged, mostly due to the annoying aspects of Dexter's character. Without giving the storyline away, this as not a style of book I can say I really enjoy or could read often. Readers who enjoyed the Time Traveler's wife or similar novels which follow two lives are sure to like this too.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Product Description▼▲
Rabbi David Levine's poignant account of how Yeshua is gathering His people (past, present, and future) together into a rich tapestry that brings a clear understanding of what God is doing on the earth among the Jews. Those who love Israel will find Rabbi Levine's insights exciting, prophetic, and full of promise. At the time the book was being written, end-time prophecy was seemingly being fulfilled as Jewish people everywhere gathered together in celebration of Jubilee and the fiftieth anniversary of the founding statehood of Israel. Find out how these events perfectly fit together in the Lord's plan to restore His people and His promises to them.

"In That Day" is Rabbi David Levine's poignant account of how Yeshua is gathering His people--past, present, and future--together into a rich tapestry that brings a clear understanding of what God is doing on the earth today among the Jews. Those who love Israel will find Rabbi Levine's insights exciting, prophetic, and full of promise. End-time prophecy is being fulfilled as Jewish people everywhere gather together in celebration of Jubilee and the fiftieth anniversary of the founding statehood of Israel. Find out how these events fit perfectly together in the Lord's plan to restore His people and His promises to them.


Author Bio▼▲
"As a leading emerging scholar, Dr. Levine represents the cutting-edge in the study of Jewish law," said Rabbi Ellenson. "His teaching, research, and mentorship will inspire all of our students on our Jerusalem campus, as they prepare for rabbinical careers as builders of Progressive Judaism in Israel and for lives of service as rabbis, cantors, and educators in North America and throughout the world."Born in New York, Dr. Levine immigrated to Israel in 1971 and served in the Israeli Army during 1980-83. He received the Ph.D. (1998) and M.A. (1991) in Talmud from Hebrew University, the M.A. in Jewish Studies from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (1990), Rabbinical Ordination from the Seminary of Judaic Studies in Jerusalem (1988), and the B.A. in Jewish History and Talmud (1980). He received the Golda Meir Fellowship, Warburg Scholarship, and Urbach Award at Hebrew University and a Doctoral Fellowship from the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture.Dr. Levine has served as a Lecturer in Talmud at HUC-JIR in Jerusalem, Lecturer in Jewish History and Talmud at the Schechter Institute for Jewish Studies in Jerusalem, Visiting Assistant Professor of Talmud and Rabbinics at JTS, and Instructor of Talmud in the Rothberg School for Overseas Students and in the Talmud Department at Hebrew University. His publications include Communal Fasts and Rabbinic Sermons - Theory and Practice in the Talmudic Period (Hebrew; 2001); and scholarly articles on responsa, Talmudic tradition, literature, and opinions, rituals, miracles, magic, rabbis and holy men in Talmudic antiquity, and Second Temple Judaism and the Hanukkah story. He is currently working on a book with Shlomo Fox on Values at War - The Land of Israel as a Moral Challenge.

This book is a collection of memories submitted by 34 family members and friends of Stephen George William Parker, as compiled and complemented by his father after Stephen’s death from cancer at the age of 46.  For those readers who did not have the pleasure of knowing Stephen, the contents of this book should make it apparent that he believed from an early age in the adage “Live every day as though it is your last” – thus the book title.  He did live life to the full, and everyone who knew him derived benefit from his joyful personality.
Proceeds from the sale of this book will go toward The Stephen Fund to help finance the placement of memorial benches along the Atlantic Beach communities in Northeast Florida that Stephen loved.  As time goes on, we hope to help all those who would like to remember someone by donating funds to help others with the same cause.  Please go to www.thestephenfund.com to find out more and learn how you can help The Stephen Fund.

This book has hundreds of photos and stories about Stephen. It is an excellent biography on his life and has an entire chapter written in his own words regarding his battle with cancer. It is a must read for those dealing with this horrible disease. BUY IT NOW!!! This book is a collection of memories submitted by 34 family members and friends of Stephen George William Parker, as compiled and complemented by his father after Stephen’s death from cancer at the age of 46. For those readers who did not have the pleasure of knowing Stephen, the contents of this book should make it apparent that he believed from an early age in the adage “Live every day as though it is your last” – thus the book title. He did live life to the full, and everyone who knew him derived benefit from his joyful personality. Proceeds from the sale of this book will go toward The Stephen Fund to help finance the placement of memorial benches along the Atlantic Beach communities in Northeast Florida that Stephen...

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
