Our Infrastructure








At Man Group, we believe that our infrastructure is crucial in allowing our front office to maintain an uninterrupted focus on growing clients’ assets.
Our experienced management team is committed to investing in infrastructure over the short and long terms. In doing this we are confident that we will be able to maintain best-in-class offerings in Technology, Compliance, Human Resources, Legal, Operations and Facilities.
We firmly believe our infrastructure is one of our key commercial differentiators, maintaining our position at the forefront of the asset management industry and allowing us to constantly evolve and adapt as our client’s needs do.




 

Technology
Operations
Risk Management
Compliance & Legal





We use advanced scientific methods to help inform our investment decisions.
Man Group believes that technology will play a key role in the future of active management. Our commitment to research in this area can be seen in many ways. We collaborate with the University of Oxford on machine learning techniques through the Oxford-Man Institute, we seek to hire the very best quantitative talent to lead our research efforts and we invest in cutting edge hardware, such as GPU computing.
These efforts often involve input from all five of our investment management businesses. In doing this, we are facilitating the effective cross-pollination of ideas, both within Man Group, and between ourselves and the academic community, which we believe will help give an edge to our investment activities.







Investment in technology is key to the on-going success of our business.
Man Group’s investment managers trade across many different asset classes, geographies and product styles. We invest in technology to help ensure we are at the forefront of investment and risk management, trading and operations.
Rosa, our proprietary central operational platform, delivers a co-ordinated process for the firm’s trading as well as enhancing risk controls and expanding the analytics available to our portfolio managers. As regulatory requirements and clients’ expectations develop, this single central system also delivers high quality, timely and dynamic reporting.
We believe this capability allows us to respond to our clients’ needs and market opportunities with greater speed, flexibility and assurance.







Robust risk management systems are essential to ensuring our duty of stewardship to our clients.
Man Group maintains rigorous oversight of counterparty exposures, group-wide liquidity and balance sheet risk. We also regularly conduct market stress tests to prepare ourselves as thoroughly as possible for potential future adverse conditions. Finally, our Risk & Finance Committee reviews our operational risk profile and challenges the adequacy of risk mitigation wherever necessary.
The firm’s risk teams operate across the entirety of the firm, and are embedded within the most senior levels of our organisation. Risk teams are also deeply involved with our investment management businesses on a day-to-day level, monitoring risk concentrations and conducting other quantitative factor analyses.







In an ever-changing regulatory landscape, we are committed to effectively combining accountability with high organisational performance.
Man Group’s corporate entities are regulated in multiple jurisdictions worldwide, putting the firm at the forefront of today’s complex global investment landscape. In this environment, our compliance and legal functions have a simple aim: to ensure that doing the right thing is the easiest and most effective way of operating.
We invest in the people and processes to support our aim of achieving the highest standards in compliance. Our legal teams are located across all the firm’s jurisdictions, to help ensure that we fully understand the context and impact of varying requirements.
We employ a ‘three lines of defence model’ to ensure our employees have the flexibility to create solutions applicable to our clients’ needs, but to do this in an appropriately controlled environment. We believe that this instils a culture of compliance into all personnel. This is consistent with our commitment to run our business to the highest standards, and for the long term.





 









Oxford-Man Institute



The Oxford-Man Institute ('OMI') is our unique collaboration with the University of Oxford. Over the last decade, the OMI, part of the university’s Department of Engineering Science, has been conducting pioneering research into quantitative finance, and now focuses primarily on machine learning techniques and data analytics.


We believe this initiative is highly supportive of the on-going evolution of our quantitative investment strategies. We are constantly being presented with new and expanding datasets and machine learning has a huge amount to offer in interpreting this information.
Located in the same building as Man AHL’s Oxford Research Lab, the OMI provides us with a direct connection to cutting-edge machine learning research and allows for the fruitful cross-pollination of ideas between the investment and academic communities. The work undertaken at the OMI, in areas as seemingly unrelated to investment as galaxy classification and measurement of the height of tides, has directly contributed to our investment methodologies. We actively use machine-learning techniques in our trading programmes and these have become a genuinely value-adding approach for our clients.


​











Our History



With a trading history spanning more than 230 years, and over 25 years of experience of global investment management, Man Group offers longevity and durability in a rapidly changing financial world. Each of Man AHL, Man Numeric, Man GLG and Man FRM has over 20 years of investing experience, and Man Group developed its private markets offering with the launch of Man GPM in 2017.

On 26th November 2007, Man's ordinary shares of 3 US cents each ("Old Ordinary Shares") were consolidated into New Ordinary Shares of 3.4285 (3 and 3/7ths) US cents each ("New Ordinary Shares") in the ratio of seven New Ordinary Shares for every eight Old Ordinary Shares held. On the same date Shareholders were issued with one B Share or C Share for each Old Ordinary Share that they held at the Record Time.
In accordance with the terms of the Return of Cash, the Dividend Alternative and the Immediate Capital Alternative were effected in December 2007 and the Deferred Capital Alternative was effected in July 2008.

For telephone dealing please call 03456 037 037 between 8.00am and 4.30pm Monday to Friday.

How will I receive shareholder documents?

Legislation has been introduced which enable companies to communicate with their shareholders by electronic means. Electronic communications (e-communications) enable the Company to communicate with our shareholders in a more timely, environmentally friendly and cost effective manner, which is in the interest of all shareholders. For these reasons the Company has decided to provide all relevant shareholder documents, including the mailing of the Annual Report and Notice of AGM, via the Company’s website, except where shareholders have requested a paper copy of the documents.
If you have signed up to receive e-communications via Equiniti’s Shareview website, you will receive an e-mail notification confirming that the documents are available on the Company’s website. If you would like to register on the Shareview site please have your shareholder reference number available, this can be found on your share certificate and dividend tax vouchers. If you have not registered for this service, we will send you a letter informing you that the documents are available from the website. You can continue to receive hard copies of Man’s communications by contacting Equiniti using the details above.

Why do I no longer receive a copy of the Interim Report?

As part of our electronic communications (e-communications) programme we have decided not to produce a printed copy of our Interim report. Instead the Interim Report will be published on our website and will be available from early November each year. If at that time you would like us to send a hard copy of our Interim Report, please e-mail us or telephone 020 7144 1000.

How can I contact the Company?

Different contacts within the organisation can be found on the contact page.

What should I do with my share certificate?

Share certificates are evidence of your ownership and should be kept in a safe place. You will need them if you want to sell all or some of your shares in the future. Share certificates are posted to shareholders at their own risk.

What is Capital Gains Tax?

Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit or gain you make when you sell or ‘dispose of’ an asset (e.g. shares). Please note that Man is unable to offer advice on capital gains tax and should you have any questions, or are unsure of your position, you should contact a duly authorised independent financial advisor.





Why have I received another share certificate?

Shareholders have been sent new share certificates following the completion of an internal restructure to insert a new holding company of the Group. Under the scheme of arrangement your existing shares (represented by a blue share certificate) were exchanged for shares in the new holding Company (represented by a white share certificate). The Man share certificates printed on blue paper with Company Number: 2921462 are no longer valid and should be destroyed. The share certificates printed on white paper with Company Number: 8172396 now represent your holding in Man and should be retained.

What is my shareholder reference number?

Your shareholder reference number is a unique 11-digit account number, which should be quoted when corresponding with Equiniti. The number is detailed at the top of your share certificate and on dividend tax vouchers.

Why do I receive multiple sets of documentation whenever you send anything to me?

If you have acquired shares in Man on more than one occasion, but the name and address you supplied to the Registrar differed, even slightly, from the existing details held, another account may have been created. If this happens and you want the accounts combined you should contact Equiniti.

How do I register my change of address?

If you have registered with Equiniti’s Shareview website, you can update your address details on-line. Alternatively you can complete the change of address form and return to Equiniti at the address shown on the form.

How do I register my change of name?

In order to register your change of name you will need to send Equiniti original documents confirming this change (eg your marriage certificate or change of name deed). Once the change has been processed, the original documents will be returned to you.

How do I transfer my shares to someone else?

If you hold a paper share certificate you can transfer your shares by completing a stock transfer form  and returning it to the Registrar.

What do I do if I lose my share certificate?

If your certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, you should contact the Company’s Registrar, Equiniti, as soon as you can. Equiniti will need to arrange for you to complete an indemnity covering the Company for any loss and you will be charged for this. Once this process is completed, Equiniti will send you a duplicate certificate.

How do I register the death of a shareholder?

Initially you should call Equiniti and notify them of the shareholders death. They will then add a notification of death restriction to the account. This will prevent future dividends being paid to the deceased shareholder.
If the shares were held solely in the name of the deceased, you should send Equiniti an official copy of the document by which the deceased’s legal personal representative was appointed, usually the grant of probate or letters of administration, impressed with the court seal. The name of the legal personal representative will be put on the register. The shares can then be sold by the personal representative, or transferred to the deceased’s beneficiary.
If the value of the deceased’s estate is below certain limits, the death can be registered using the small estates procedure. Details of the current limits and the procedure involved can be obtained from Equiniti.
If the shares were held jointly by the deceased and another person, a copy of the death certificate must be sent to Equiniti. The shares will then be registered in the name(s) of the surviving holder(s), and the relevant share certificates will be amended to reflect this.

How can I confirm the number of shares I hold?

If you have registered with Equiniti’s Shareview website, you can see this information on-line. Alternatively, you can contact Equiniti on 0371 384 2112, who will be able to confirm your shareholding.

How can I calculate the value of my shares?

Using the share price information provided above in the Share Price section you can calculate the value of your share holding, at both the purchase date and at present.

I hold certificates which quote Man Group plc Ordinary shares of 18 US cents each or Man Group plc Ordinary shares of 3 US cents each. Are these still valid?

No. Only share certificates relating to Man Group plc Ordinary shares of 3 3/7 US cents, issued on or after the latest consolidation on 26 November 2007 are valid.





What is an AGM?

AGM stands for Annual General Meeting, which the Company is required to hold every year and which every shareholder is invited to attend. The meeting reviews Man’s performance over the year and provides an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions and vote on key issues, such as the appointment of directors and the authority of the directors to issue shares.

What if I cannot attend the AGM?

How frequently are dividends paid?

Man generally pays dividends twice per year, following the announcement of the final and interim results. Any final or interim dividends are usually paid in July and December respectively.

Why do you declare your dividends in US dollars but pay them in sterling?

Man Group plc is a UK registered company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, however Man's functional currency is US dollars and therefore dividends are declared in US dollars, with an equivalent amount in Sterling payable to shareholders.

How do you set the exchange rate for dividend payments? 

The dividend exchange rate is set on the day prior to the announcement of the dividend.

Can I choose which currency I receive my dividends in?

Man only pays its dividends in Sterling. Shareholders based outside the UK, can ask Equiniti to arrange payments directly into their bank account, although there is a charge for this service. For further information please visit Equiniti’s website.

How are dividends paid?

Dividends are generally paid in cash and can be paid either by cheque, or directly into your bank or building society account. You can also choose to use your dividend to purchase further shares in the Company, by joining the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

What is a DRIP?

DRIP stands for Dividend Reinvestment Plan, which gives shareholders the opportunity to use their dividend to purchase further Man Group plc shares. Shareholders receive as many whole shares as can be bought with their dividend, taking into account any costs of the DRIP. Any residual monies left, after purchasing the shares out of your dividend payment, will be added to your next dividend payment.

How do I obtain the Company’s dividend history?

A full history of the dividends paid to shareholders can be found here.

What was the price of my DRIP shares?

You can find the price of your DRIP shares by looking at the Company’s dividend history.

What should I do if I have lost my dividend cheque?

If you have lost your dividend cheque you should contact Equiniti immediately, confirming that the payment has been lost. They will then arrange for the cheque to be stopped and issue you with a duplicate cheque. Please note that there may be a charge for this service.
To avoid any further loss, you may wish to consider arranging for the dividend to be paid directly into your bank account, which can be done by completing the dividend mandate form and returning it to Equiniti.

What should I do if I have lost my tax voucher?

If you lose a tax voucher you should contact Equiniti, confirming which tax voucher has been lost. A duplicate will be issued upon payment of an administration charge.





What are E-communications?

E-communications stands for electronic communications which enable us to communicate with you via e-mail and our website, rather than sending you printed documents. The service is run by Equiniti, through the Shareview website. You will need to have your shareholder reference number, which can be found on your share certificate or tax vouchers. The Shareview website enables you to:
Receive important shareholder communications by e-mail
Access details of your shareholding in Man
Change your details on-line, including postal address, e-mail address, mailing preference and dividend mandate

Be aware!
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas ‘brokers’ who target shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares, generally in US or UK investments.
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and their activities have resulted in considerable losses for some investors. It is not just the novice investor that has been deceived in this way; many of the victims have been successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.


If you receive any unsolicited offers of investment advice:
Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation
Check that they are properly authorised (for example, in the UK by the Financial Conducts Authority) before getting involved
The Financial Conducts Authority also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the Financial Conducts Authority so that this list can be kept up to date and any other appropriate action can be considered. The Financial Conducts Authority can be contacted by completing an online form
If unsolicited calls persist, hang up
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be foundhere.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in company mailings.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]




Man Group head office at Swan Lane in London (building in the background)


Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]

RMF was one of 107 financial institutions and 13,000 individuals to invest in such funds. As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]

Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]

Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

RMF and Bernard Madoff[edit]
RMF, a former division of Man Group, invested 0.5% of its funds under management at the time with various 3rd party funds which, in turn, had positions in funds ultimately managed by Bernard Madoff. RMF was one of 107 financial institutions and 13,000 individuals to invest in such funds. As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]

Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

RMF and Bernard Madoff[edit]
RMF, a former division of Man Group, invested 0.5% of its funds under management at the time with various 3rd party funds which, in turn, had positions in funds ultimately managed by Bernard Madoff. RMF was one of 107 financial institutions and 13,000 individuals to invest in such funds. As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]

Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

RMF and Bernard Madoff[edit]
RMF, a former division of Man Group, invested 0.5% of its funds under management at the time with various 3rd party funds which, in turn, had positions in funds ultimately managed by Bernard Madoff. RMF was one of 107 financial institutions and 13,000 individuals to invest in such funds. As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Publication Date: July 01, 2004

 In 2004, Man Group was the world's largest packager and distributor of investment vehicles tied to hedge funds. The firm had an equity market capitalization of $10 billion and funds under management of $38 billion. Man's offerings spanned a wide range of risk/reward profiles packaged in the form of diversified funds of hedge funds, funds that focused on specific hedge fund styles, and funds that invested in a single hedge fund manager. The company also created structured products that consisted of funds of hedge funds combined with principal protection and leverage. An essential part of the strategy was to grow and maintain a global distribution network. Believers considered Man Group to be at the vanguard of a revolution in the investment management industry, while skeptics thought the hedge fund space had become overcrowded and that it would be hard for Man to scale its business and obtain good investment returns for clients.

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]




Man Group head office at Swan Lane in London (building in the background)


Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

RMF was one of 107 financial institutions and 13,000 individuals to invest in such funds. As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]




Man Group head office at Swan Lane in London (building in the background)


Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

RMF, a former division of Man Group, invested 0.5% of its funds under management at the time with various 3rd party funds which, in turn, had positions in funds ultimately managed by Bernard Madoff. RMF was one of 107 financial institutions and 13,000 individuals to invest in such funds. As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

Man Group plc is an alternative investment management business initially founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage by James Man in 1783. It provides a range of funds for institutional and private investors globally and is the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund company, reporting $78.1 billion in funds under management as of March 2015.[3][4] The firm is headquartered at Riverbank House in London and employs over 1,000 people in various locations worldwide.[5] The company is a noted sponsor of the arts and charitable initiatives, including the Man Booker Prize and the Man Charitable Trust.
In recent years the firm has made several acquisitions as part of its strategy to diversify the business, particularly in the United States. These acquisitions including Man Numeric, a quantitative equity manager. The firm has also seen a shift towards institutional clients and, with its 2016 acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets (Man GPM), a move into private markets.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with the rum for its daily "rum tot", a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout.[6] The company further expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.[6]
The firm was renamed ED & F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED & F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two entirely separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing exclusively on financial services and ED & F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.[7]
In 2007 Man Group moved into its present form as an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Man Group attained its current structure over time through acquisition. Man AHL is the oldest investment manager of the group, having been acquired over time from 1989 to 1994. Man Group’s other investment managers were acquired between 2010 and 2014. In 2010 Man Group acquired Man GLG, previously GLG Partners for $1.6 billion,[9] then Man FRM in 2012[10] and Man Numeric in 2014.[11]
Structure and operations[edit]

Man Group offers strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes:[12]
Man AHL[edit]
Founded in 1987, Man AHL is a diversified quantitative investment manager offering absolute return and long-only funds, with both momentum and non-momentum strategies. In recent years, the manager’s sales have shifted from retail to institutional investors. Man AHL has over 100 investment professionals.[13]
Man FRM[edit]
Established in 1991, and acquired by Man Group in 2012, Man FRM's 58 research and investment professionals operate from London, New York, Tokyo, Guernsey and Pfäffikon(SZ), Switzerland.[14]
Man GLG[edit]
Man GLG was established in London in 1995 as GLG Partners. It was publicly listed in 2007 before being acquired by Man Group in 2010 for $1.6 billion. Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager. Man GLG utilises absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine was expected to boost the division’s US CLO business.[15]
Man Numeric[edit]
Man Numeric was established in 1989 and acquired by Man Group in 2014. A Boston-based quantitative asset manager with $16.7 billion FUM as at December 2014, Man Numeric offers long-only, active extension and hedged equity strategies. Man Group acquired Man Numeric to build a diversified quantitative fund management business in non-momentum strategies, and to develop Man Group’s presence in the North American market. In 2014, Man Numeric’s average client portfolio out-performed industry benchmarks by 3% before fees.[16]
Strategy[edit]
Luke Ellis was appointed as Man Group’s CEO in September 2016.[17] He succeeded Manny Roman, whom Ellis had worked with for seven years at Man Group and had known for two decades. Ellis' strategic objective for Man Group is to continue diversifying the firm through acquisition, as well as invest in its infrastructure.[18]
Man Group has seen significant cost-cutting, led by Co-President Jonathan Sorrell, with a $270 million cost-saving programme planned for delivery in 2015 achieved ahead of schedule.[19][20][21] Sorrell's role as President was expanded by Ellis to include corporate strategy, private markets and acquisitions.[22]

As of 2014, 59% of all such funds have been recovered and returned to various institutions and individuals.[40]
Man Booker Prizes[edit]
Man Group has sponsored The Man Booker literary prize since 2002.[41] Described by The Telegraph newspaper as “...arguably the UK’s most prestigious" literary prize, the £50,000 award was created in 1973 to increase the reading of quality fiction and attract “the intelligent general audience”.[42][43] Each year the winner is announced at an awards dinner broadcast live by BBC Television. Inclusion into the award's shortlist and attendant press coverage is known to provide a significant boost to book sales and bookstore visits, with sales trebling in some cases.[44]
The 2016 prize was awarded to the New York novelist Paul Beatty, for The Sellout.[45] Previous winners include Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.[43] The 2014 award went to author Richard Flanagan for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, with his prize presented by Chair of judges AC Grayling at London’s Guildhall. It was the first year in which eligibility for the award was expanded to include any novel written in English and published in the UK.[46] Man also sponsors the Man Booker International Prize. This £50,000 prize is awarded each year on the basis of a single book translated into English, and aims to encourage the publishing and reading of quality fiction in translation. The prize is divided equally between author and publisher.[47]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Man Group supports various charitable initiatives, principally through the Man Charitable Trust and the Oxford-Man Institute:
Man Charitable Trust[edit]
Set up in 1978, The Man Charitable Trust is an independent registered charity that funds small to medium-size charities focusing on literacy and numeracy programmes. It also funds programmes in support of access to education for disadvantaged people. In 2014 the trust awarded £427,075 to UK charities, including £50,000 to Beanstalk, a charity that recruits and trains volunteers to provide reading support in primary schools, and £50,000 to National Numeracy, a charity dedicated to raising low levels of numeracy among adults and children.[48][49]
Oxford-Man Institute[edit]
In June 2007 Man launched a joint project with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Man Group’s initial financial commitment to the Institute was £13.75 million, one of the largest single donations to a British higher education institution in recent years.[50] In 2016 the Oxford-Man Institute expanded its focus on machine learning and data analytics, becoming part of the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science. The development of the OMI's focus creates a hub for machine learning and data analysis at Eagle House, the current home of the OMI and Man AHL's Oxford Research lab.[51]
Former sponsorships and charitable initiatives[edit]
Man Group is a former sponsor of the Man Group International Climate Change Award and the Man Asian Literary Prize.[52][53] In the 1990s, Man was a founding member of the East London Partnership, which became the East London Business Alliance, a business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility and employee volunteering.[54]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
