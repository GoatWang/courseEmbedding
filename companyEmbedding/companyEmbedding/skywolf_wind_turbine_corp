A former United States Marine, Brock started to build and test prototypes, and discovered that by inserting a tube within a tube that a fluid bypasses the inner tube and demonstrates a pulling effect on the fluid passing through the inner tube. He successfully patented this discovery. Brock went on to concentrate on wind turbines and successfully increased the efficiency to three times a conventional wind turbine. This design was identified as a Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine (DAWT) by design.

Markets - SkyWolf Wind Turbines

























































































































HomeMarkets


Markets


The use of alternative energy to capture renewable energy sources has been actively implemented and executed both globally and on a national scale. Currently the national grid structure is approaching 100+ years of service with old delivery technology and unreliable aging grid structures stretching over 450,000 miles of transmission lines. On a global scale, under-developed countries face a crises as only 20% of their population is within reach and service of an energy grid structure. Sustainable technologies and escalation in energy cost is further driving the market need for alternative energy products. As a result, New York State initiated Executive Order 88 in 2012 which dictates that all NYS facilities shall reduce their energy utility usage by 20%.
We have defined four major primary markets in our market strategy map and they include International, National, New York State, and the Regional Finger Lakes market. Customers in these markets include under-developed countries, public and private institutions, government and municipal facilities, airports, small business owners, and the private home owner. The increase in new Wind Farms and additional micro-grid structures also position us well with our DAWT.





Market Segment


Target



 
International
Developing and under-served countries


 
National (USA)

Applications & Micro Grids - SkyWolf Wind Turbines























































































































HomeApplications & Micro Grids


Applications & Micro Grids



SkyWolf® offers a patented Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine (DAWT). A product that uses renewable wind and solar energy sources combined in one turbine. This turbine is significantly smaller standing only 30’ tall and 8’ diameter as compared to larger traditional wind turbines standing between 100’ to 300’ tall. Our product is patent protected and the only turbine in existence that combines wind and solar in an innovative design.
There are several unique DAWT properties that separate us from the completion. Our smaller footprint DAWT places us in a perfect position as an alternative to the large wind turbine mfg and the small less robust turbine suppliers. In addition, the energy production of our DAWT at lower wind speeds and ease of installation is a technical advantage over the large turbines as they need higher wind speeds to produce energy. The added benefit of solar panels also allows us the technical advantage of producing power on any given day in any weather condition. Additionally, our price point is very competitive against each turbine type.
With the small footprint design and high energy output utilizing wind and solar, the Hybrid DAWT is well suited for multiple installations for Micro Grid applications to supporting critical infrastructure bldgs for municipal facilities, government institutions, colleges and hospitals, to single installations for the private business and home owner.

Micro Grid concept
The typical power grid is a centralized model. Power is generated at a large central facility, the voltage is stepped-up to transmission voltage levels, transmitted over miles, and then distributed through a series of substations which reduce the power back down to distribution levels before finally being used by consumers. Conversely, the microgrid conceptual model is based on local generation of power. Micro grids increase reliability locally through distributed generation, energy storage, redundant distribution, automated switches, and grid stabilization. Local generation and storage allow sections of the power grid to operate independently in an intentional island mode during a grid disturbance such as thunderstorms or heavy snow fall to minimize outages. Efficiency is increased by locating generation close to the consumption, which reduces costs and losses associated with transmission. Micro grids also support sustainability through the incorporation of distributed energy resources (DER) while maintaining grid stability.
How a Micro-Grid works

To better understand the micro grid, one needs to be familiar with the isolated grid model. Isolated grids are basic grids in which a small industrial facility, remote community or military base relies on DER’s in the form of combustion type generation, renewable generation sources (PV, wind, biomass, etc.) and storage systems, such as flywheels or batteries, for grid stability. These generation systems deliver power onto a common grid or power bus. Simply installing an isolated grid into the utility system would cause grid instability. The utility needs to be able to “see” what is occurring within the isolated grid in order to understand how to properly dispatch the necessary power. A Distributed Control System (DCS) maintains a base load of power by forecasting demand, determining the proper mix of DER’s to meet the demand and maintains proper grid power quality with the objective of extending fuel reserves as long as possible.
Americas Micro – Grid

Micro grids are better positioned than the centralized grid to meet the known and unknown needs of the future because the community participates in the production, consumption and creation of new (cost reducing) revenue streams for their local grid.

	Corporate History and General Information
	about the Company



	 


	SkyWolf Wind Turbine Corporation
	(the “Company”) is an early-stage company which was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on August
	3, 2010 and was formerly known as Brock Renewable Energy Research & Development Corporation prior to the Company completing
	a name change in March 2011. The Company is engaged in the business of the development and commercialization of wind turbines
	and other renewable energy technologies. Specifically, the Company is the designer, manufacturer, and supplier of a patented Solar
	Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine (HDAWT), a product that uses renewable wind and solar energy sources combined in one turbine.


	 


	The Company is located
	at 156 Court Street, Geneseo, New York 14454. The Company’s main phone number is (585) 447-9135. The Company’s fiscal
	year end is December 31. The Company has not filed for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor is in the process
	of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings.



	 





	Summary of the Business and Operations	



	 



	Company Introduction



	 


	SkyWolf sells its patented
	Solar Hybrid Wind Turbine System, which we believe is the ultimate renewable energy product. Our HDAWT is designed to extract
	energy from both wind and sun simultaneously or individually depending on which energy source is available. In addition, it can
	be installed almost anywhere typically requiring only local building permits. We believe that this technology opens the door to
	affordable, clean power throughout the world for homeowners, farmers, municipalities, colleges, mini-grids, prisons, airports,
	commercial properties and in particular undeveloped countries since wind and sun energy are bountiful resources available world-wide.

	Corporate History and General Information about the Company



	 


	SkyWolf Wind Turbine Corporation
	(the “Company”), located at 156 Court Street, Geneseo, New York 14454, was incorporated under the laws of the State
	of New York on August 3, 2010 and was formerly known as Brock Renewable Energy Research & Development Corporation. The Company
	is the designer, manufacturer, and supplier of a patented Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine aka “The Hybrid”,
	which uses wind and solar energy sources combined in one unit. The Company has not filed for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar
	proceedings nor is in the process of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings. The Company currently has
	six full-time employees/consultants along with several independent sales representatives. The manufacturing facility and administrative
	offices are located in a single 5,000 sq. ft. building where products are developed, manufactured, marketed and sold along with
	feasibility studies to determine optimum site location.


	 

	 




	Business and Market Summary



	 


	After six years of
	research and development that resulted in three patents, we believe that SkyWolf has made a major technological breakthrough with
	its patented Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine design (DAWT). We believe the DAWT is capable of producing more energy output at
	lower wind speeds than conventional wind turbines and with a significantly smaller footprint. By reducing static pressure behind
	its rotor blades, we believe that the DAWT will exponentially increase efficiency and electric energy output as compared to conventional
	wind turbines of the same size. Adding Solar to the DAWT resulted in another patent for a Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind
	Turbine (HDAWT or “Hybrid”), which we believe gives SkyWolf a distinct advantage in the renewable energy market by
	harnessing wind and solar energy simultaneously. We believe that SkyWolf’s design addresses the pitfalls and limitations
	of conventional wind turbines. Specifically, we believe that consumers with extremely rural or difficult sites or a varied mix
	of Solar/Wind energy will greatly benefit from the Hybrid design. SkyWolf’s expected improvements over small to medium sized
	wind turbine competitors are listed below:


	 







	·





	Current height of
	competitors reduced from an average of 100' to Sky Wolf's 32'

	.





	 







	o




	No FAA permit required
	for SkyWolf, only a normal building permit.





	 







	o




	SkyWolf only requires
	100 ft

	2

	instead of 43,560 ft

	2

	(1.00 Acre).





	 







	·





	The
	fan blades are enclosed in a shroud with SkyWolf which we believe

	;





	 







	o




	Results in substantial
	noise reduction.





	 







	o




	Eliminates sun flutter
	from large rotating blades.





	 







	o




	Removes the liability
	of ice flying off fan blades and causing injury.





	 







	o




	Dramatically reduces
	bird deaths.





	 







	·





	We
	believe that SkyWolf reduces site issues because

	;





	 







	o




	Increased wind speed
	range makes more sites viable.





	 







	o




	32' height is like a
	tree hence much less visually challenging.





	 







	o




	The small, shroud containing
	the blades looks appealing.





	 







	o




	It can be erected on
	any approved building lot.





	 







	o




	Maintenance is simple
	and cost effective at 32' (no massive crane required).





	  






	 



	7








	 




	 









	·





	We
	believe that SkyWolf dramatically increases efficiency because

	;





	 







	o




	Expands the operational
	wind speed range from 6 - 31 mph to 5 – 60 mph.





	 







	o




	Extracts at least 50%
	more power out of wind to make it much more affordable.





	 







	·





	Adding Solar expands
	the number of usable sites and increases energy output.






	 


	We believe that the
	void in this market segment provides a unique opportunity that can be filled by SkyWolf, which we expect will set the stage for
	substantial market penetration and subsequent sales.

	We believe that the most promising aspect of SkyWolf’s technology
	lies in the expansion of new sales to customers who are dissatisfied with the current limitations of conventional wind turbines.
	Our Hybrid can extract both Wind and Solar energy simultaneously to give each customer usable power every day regardless of site
	location or weather.

	Each Hybrid unit comes with a complete integrated system that captures, converts, and monitors wind and
	solar energy production which can be grid-tied or connected into a battery based system (off-grid). Our product is patent protected
	and is the only unit in the market that combines wind and solar in a unique and innovative design. The unique properties of the
	Hybrid gives consumers an alternative to larger and less efficient wind turbines and/or over-sized solar arrays. The added benefit
	of solar panels incorporated into our hybrid design allows the generation of power over a broader range of conditions. Our competitive
	price point perfectly positions the Hybrid nationally and internationally in the energy market. Additional state and federal tax
	credits assist in the sale and value of our Hybrid in the US market. The Company has secured sales in New York State in both the
	agricultural and residential markets. Plus preliminary negotiations are underway in Colombia, South America, South Africa, Peru,
	Mexico and Europe totaling1.5 Billion dollars or more in potential sales.


	 



	Risks and Uncertainties facing the Company	



	 


	As an early-stage company
	with a limited operating history, the Company has experienced losses since its inception. The Company’s independent auditors
	have issued a report questioning the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. That is, the Company needs to create
	a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. As a development stage company,
	management of the Company has limited experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the Company and in
	marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale.


	 



	One
	of the biggest challenges facing the Company is the ability to


	increase its sales revenue
	and raise adequate capital to develop and execute project opportunities.



	 


	Due to financial constraints,
	the Company has to date conducted limited operations. If the Company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding
	for project opportunities, it is unlikely that the Company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further
	develop its business plan. Moreover, the above assumes that the Company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in
	the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers, neither of which are currently
	known or guaranteed.


	 


	Due to these and other
	factors, the Company’s need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising
	substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.



	 




	Trading Market



	 


	Currently, there is no
	trading market for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities
	on the OTC Bulletin Board as soon as possible, which may be while this offering is still in process. There can be no assurance
	that the Company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. See “RISK FACTORS” and “DESCRIPTION
	OF SECURITIES”.

	Risk factors

	RISK FACTORS




	 




	You should carefully consider the risks
	described below together with all of the other information included in this Prospectus before making an investment decision with
	regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this Prospectus that are not historic facts are forward-looking
	statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth
	in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition
	or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose
	all or part of your investment.




	 

	 



	RISKS RELATED TO THE OFFERING





	 






	As there is no minimum for our offering,
	if only a few persons purchase shares they could lose their investment.






	 




	Since there is no minimum
	with respect to the number of securities to be sold directly by the Company in this Offering, if only a few securities are sold,
	we may not have enough capital to sustain our business. In such an event, it is highly likely that any investment would be lost.
	As such, proceeds from this Offering may not be sufficient to meet the objectives we state in this Prospectus, other corporate
	milestones that we may set, or to avoid a “going concern” modification in future reports of our auditors as to uncertainty
	with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we fail to raise sufficient capital, we would expect to have to
	significantly decrease operating expenses, which will curtail the growth of our business.


	 




	Investing in the Company is a highly
	speculative investment and could result in the loss of your entire investment.




	 


	A purchase of the offered
	securities is significantly speculative and involves significant risks. The offered securities should not be purchased by any
	person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire purchase price. The business objectives of the Company are also speculative,
	and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives. The stockholders of the Company may be unable to realize a substantial return
	on their purchase of the offered securities, or any return whatsoever, and may lose their entire investment in the Company. For
	this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered securities should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully
	and consult with their attorney, business advisor and/or investment advisor.


	 




	The offering price of the offered securities
	has been arbitrarily determined by the Company and such offering should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair
	market value of the offered securities



	.



	 


	Currently there is no
	public market for the Company’s common stock. The offering price for the offered securities has been arbitrarily determined
	by the Company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or other established criteria
	of value of the Company. Thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the
	offered securities.


	 



	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY’S
	BUSINESS



	 




	The Company has limited revenues to
	date



	.



	 


	The Company has generated
	limited revenues to date. Most of management’s time, and the Company’s limited resources have been spent on R&D,
	and developing its business strategy. Most of the activity has been centered in the following areas; researching potential opportunities,
	contacting prospective partners, exploring marketing contacts, establishing


	operations, preparing a business
	plan, selecting professional advisors and consultants, and seeking capital for the Company.



	 







	 



	10








	 




	 




	The Company has limited operating history of its own, and
	as such, any prospective investor can only assess the Company’s profitability or performance on a limited basis to date.




	 


	Because the Company is
	an early-stage company with limited operating history, it is impossible for an investor to assess the performance of the Company
	or to determine whether the Company will meet its projected business plan. The Company has limited financial results upon which
	an investor may judge its potential. As a company that only recently emerged from the development-stage, the Company may in the
	future still experience under-capitalization, shortages, setbacks and many of the problems, delays and expenses encountered by
	any early stage business. An investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the Company management’s
	history and its projected operations in light of the risks, expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in
	the Company’s industry.



	 





	The Company has a correspondingly small
	financial and accounting organization. Being a public company may strain the Company's resources, divert management’s attention
	and affect its ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.




	 


	The Company is an early-stage
	company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured
	and developed finance and accounting group. Once it becomes a public reporting company, the Company will become subject to the
	reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations
	promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the Company
	as it develops its business plan, services and scope. These costs have made, and will continue to make, some activities more difficult,
	time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel, systems and resources.


	 


	The Securities Exchange
	Act requires, among other things, that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
	financial reporting. In order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
	reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted
	from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the Company's business, financial
	condition and results of operations.


	 


	These rules and regulations
	may also make it difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If the Company is
	unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance, its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors,
	especially those directors who may be deemed independent, will be significantly curtailed.


	 




	The Company expects to incur additional
	expenses and may ultimately never be profitable.




	 


	The Company has only recently
	emerged from its status as a development-stage company, and it has limited operations to date. The Company will need to continue
	to generate revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. To become profitable, the Company must successfully develop and operate
	its product sales and marketing business. These processes involve many factors that are beyond the Company’s control, including
	the type of competition that the Company may encounter. Ultimately, in spite of the Company’s best or reasonable efforts,
	the Company may never actually generate revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses or become profitable.


	 




	The Company may not be able to continue
	as a going concern.




	 


	The ability of the
	Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to fund future operations through additional
	financing from investors and/or lenders or through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations. Due to
	these and other factors, there is substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.



	 







	 



	11








	 






	 






	The Company’s independent auditors
	have issued a report raising a substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.




	 


	In their audited financial
	report, the Company’s independent auditors have issued added an explanatory paragraph that unless the Company is able to
	generate sufficient cash flows from operations and/or obtain additional financing, there is a substantial doubt as to its ability
	to continue as a going concern. The Company anticipates that it would need substantial capital over the next 12 months to continue
	as a going concern to expand its operations in accordance with its current business plan.


	   




	No assurance of market acceptance.




	 


	Even if the Company successfully
	markets, sells and distributes technology products, there can be no assurance that the market reception will be positive for the
	Company or its ventures.


	 


	The widespread adoption
	and use of the Company’s wind turbine products will represent fundamental change in the energy industry. As with any new
	technology, there is a substantial risk that potential customers may not accept the potential benefits of the Company’s
	products. Market acceptance of Company’s products will depend, in large part, upon the ability of Company to demonstrate
	the performance advantages and cost-effectiveness of its products over competing products. There can be no assurance that Company
	will be able to market its technology successfully on a widespread basis or that any of Company’s current or future products
	or services will be accepted in the marketplace. Furthermore, Company intends to develop products and systems and sell them at
	a price assumed by Company sufficient to generate a profit. Even if Company’s products and services are accepted in the
	industry, the market for its products may not be able to support Company’s pricing structure.


	 




	Reliance on third party agreements and
	relationships is necessary for development of the Company's business.




	 


	The Company will need
	strong third party relationships and partnerships in order to develop and grow its business. The Company will be substantially
	dependent on these strategic partners and third party relationships to commercialize its business.




	 






	The proposed operations of the Company
	are speculative.




	 


	The success of the proposed
	business plan of the Company will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management of the Company.
	Although the Company has a business plan and intends to execute its overall business strategy, limited operations have been conducted
	to date and the proposed operations of the Company remain speculative.


	 




	Executive officers, directors and 5%
	shareholders of the Company will retain voting control after the offering, which will allow them to exert substantial influence
	over major corporate decisions.





	 



	The Company anticipates
	that its executive officers and directors (together with 5% shareholders) will, in the aggregate, beneficially own enough of its
	issued and outstanding capital stock following the completion of this offering, assuming the sale of all Shares hereby offered,
	to exert voting control. Accordingly, the present shareholders, by virtue of their percentage share ownership and certain procedures
	established by the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company for the election of its directors, may effectively
	control the board of directors and the policies of the Company. As a result, these stockholders will retain substantial control
	over matters requiring approval by the Company’s stockholders, such as (without limitation) the election of directors and
	approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing
	a change in control, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock
	or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their Shares.



	 





	The Company depends on its management
	team and employees to operate its business effectively.




	 


	The Company's future success
	is dependent in large part upon its ability to understand and develop the business plan and to attract and retain highly skilled
	management, operational and executive personnel. In particular, due to the relatively early stage of the Company's business, its
	future success is highly dependent on its officers, to provide the necessary experience and background to execute the Company's
	business plan. The loss of any officer’s services could impede, particularly initially as the Company builds a record and
	reputation, its ability to develop its objectives, particularly in its ability to develop, commercialize and further its business
	and products.


	 






	 



	12








	 




	 


	The Company’s business
	also depends on its ability to attract and retain talented product marketing and sales professionals in the United States and
	in overseas territories. Any loss of key members of the team and the customer relationship associated with the member can impact
	the business significantly.


	 




	Government regulation could negatively
	impact the business.




	 


	The Company’s business
	segments may be subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Due to the potential wide
	scope of the Company’s operations, the Company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities,
	including various local and municipal agencies and government sub-divisions. The Company may incur increased costs necessary to
	comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. The Company’s operations
	could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry.


	  




	The Company's election not to opt out
	of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies.




	 


	Pursuant to the JOBS Act
	of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised
	accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition
	period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,
	the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company's
	financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company
	which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards
	may be used.


	 




	The recently enacted JOBS Act will also
	allow the Company to postpone the date by which it must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors
	and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC.





	 



	The recently enacted JOBS
	Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on “emerging growth companies. The Company meets the definition of an emerging
	growth company and so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” it will, among other things:


	 


	-be exempt from the provisions
	of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation
	report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;


	 


	 -be exempt from
	the “say on pay” provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive
	officers) and the “say on golden parachute” provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden
	parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the
	Dodd-Frank Act and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd- Frank Act relating to compensation of its chief executive officer;


	 


	-be permitted to omit
	the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934 and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and


	 


	-be exempt from any rules
	that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to
	the auditor’s report on the financial statements.


	 






	 



	13








	 




	 


	Although the Company is
	still evaluating the JOBS Act, it currently intends to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements
	that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company”. The Company has elected not
	to opt out of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)
	of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required
	to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting so long as it
	qualifies as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over
	financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, the Company may elect not
	to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive
	officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors
	and securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common
	stock may be adversely affected.



	 





	The Company may face significant competition
	from companies that serve its industries.





	 



	The Company’s business
	is highly competitive with respect to price, quality, assortment and presentation, and customer service. This competitive market
	creates the risk of adverse impact to the Company’s revenues due to the potential need to reduce prices, and thus reduce
	margins, in order to stay competitive. If the Company fails to timely and effectively respond to competitive pressures and changes
	in the markets, it could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.


	 


	Furthermore, the Company
	competes with firms who may have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than the Company and may be able
	to secure better arrangements with suppliers and employees and more successfully attract and retain customers. The Company may
	be vulnerable to the marketing power and degree of consumer recognition of these larger competitors. The Company is susceptible
	to the risk that its competitors could effectively venture into the Company’s areas of expertise, in which case, the Company
	may not be able to compete successfully, and competitive pressures may adversely affect its business, results of operations and
	financial condition.


	 




	Pricing pressures may be significant
	in the Company’s industry.




	 


	Because the market that
	the Company intends to target is competitive and large in volume, customers routinely ask for lower pricing to make their products
	more competitive. This phenomenon can put pricing pressure on the Company’s products and reduce profit margin over time.


	 




	The Company is subject to the potential
	factors of market and customer changes



	.



	 


	The business of the Company
	is susceptible to rapidly changing preferences of the marketplace and its customers. The needs of customers are subject to constant
	change. Although the Company intends to carry out its plan of developing and selling products and solutions to satisfy changing
	customer demands in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that funds for such expenditures will be available or that the
	Company's competition will not develop similar or superior capabilities or that the Company will be successful in its internal
	efforts.


	 


	The future success of
	the Company will depend in part on its ability to respond effectively to rapidly changing trends, industry standards and customer
	requirements.


	 


	The development of new
	technology is a significant risk. Even though the Company plans to invest in marketing and sales of leading technology products
	and services, new technology may come to market that makes the Company’s products obsolete and less attractive to customers. 


	 




	General economic factors may adversely
	affect the Company’s financial performance.




	 


	Economic conditions beyond
	the Company’s control, such as increased unemployment levels, inflation, increases in fuel, other energy costs and interest
	rates, lack of available credit, erosion in consumer confidence and other factors affecting disposable consumer income may adversely
	affect the Company’s business. Many of those factors, as well as commodity rates, transportation costs, costs of labor,
	insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, lease costs, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic
	factors, also affect the Company’s cost of goods sold as well as its general and administrative expenses, which may adversely
	affect sales or profitability.


	 






	 



	14








	 






	 






	The Company does not maintain certain
	insurance, including errors and omissions and indemnification insurance.





	 



	The Company has limited
	capital and, therefore, does not currently have a policy of insurance against liabilities arising out of the negligence of its
	officers and directors and/or deficiencies in any of its business operations. Even assuming that the Company obtained insurance,
	there is no assurance that such insurance coverage would be adequate to satisfy any potential claims made against the Company,
	its officers and directors, or its business operations. Any such liability which might arise could be substantial and may exceed
	the assets of the Company. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company provide for indemnification of officers
	and directors to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
	Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons, it is the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission that such indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act, and is therefore, unenforceable.


	 




	Intellectual property and/or trade secret
	protection may be inadequate



	.



	 


	The Company has applied
	for and received some intellectual property or trade secret protection in certain aspects of its business. There can be no assurance
	that the current protection is adequate or that the Company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or
	the introduction of substantially similar solutions and services.


	 


	The technology and products
	that the Company plans to market may be accused of infringing patents that the Company, its supplier and technology partner may
	not be aware of initially. Patents owners may take action to block the sale of such products, which can impact sales of the Company. 


	 


	High technology industries,
	such as the energy industry in which the Company operates, are characterized by the existence of both an increasing number of
	patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert exclusive
	patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the Company. While there currently
	are no outstanding infringement claims pending by or against the Company, there can be no assurance that third parties will not
	assert infringement claims against the Company in the future, that assertions by such parties will not result in costly litigation,
	or that the Company would prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents or copyrights from
	third parties on commercially reasonable terms. Any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the Company could have
	a material adverse effect on the Company.


	 


	To date, the Company has
	relied on a combination of patent protection and trade secret methods of protecting its proprietary information. There can be
	no assurance that those strategies will afford protection to that information, and there can be no assurance that the patents
	for which it has applied, if issued, would provide the Company with meaningful protection from competition. Furthermore, there
	can be no assurance that the Company’s products will not be found to infringe on any patent or other right held by others.
	In the event that any such products or services are found to so infringe, the Company could be required to seek a license with
	respect to such patented technology, if such a license is available, or incur substantial costs to redesign the infringing products
	or services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company.


	 




	The Company may not be able to attract
	new customers or fuel its growth.





	 



	The Company hopes to grow
	its business by increasing sales and developing new products. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able
	to successfully implement any of its growth strategies. To successfully achieve growth, the Company must continually evaluate
	the adequacy of its existing systems and find new uses for its unique turbine. There can be no assurance that the Company will
	adequately anticipate all of the changing demands that growth, should it occur, will impose on the Company’s systems, procedures,
	and structure. Any failure to adequately anticipate and respond to such changing demands is likely to have a material adverse
	effect on the Company.

	If the Company is unable to develop
	and introduce new products and improvements, the Company may be unable to compete in the marketplace.


	 


	 


	The market for the Company’s
	wind turbine products is characterized by evolving industry requirements. Accordingly, the Company’s future performance
	depends on a number of factors, including its ability to identify emerging technological trends in its target markets, to develop
	and maintain competitive products, to enhance its products by adding innovative features that differentiate the Company’s
	products from those of its competitors, and to manufacture and bring products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. There
	can be no assurance, however, that the Company will successfully complete the development of any products, that such products
	will achieve market acceptance that such products will receive regulatory approvals where required, that any required regulatory
	approvals will be received in a timely manner, or that such products can be produced at competitive prices, or at all. In the
	event that its products are not timely developed, do not gain market acceptance or cannot be manufactured at competitive prices,
	the Company’s business could be materially adversely affected.


	 




	Investors in the offering will experience
	immediate dilution of the value of their shares.




	 


	Purchasers of the Shares
	will experience immediate dilution in the value of their Shares. Dilution represents the difference between the price per share
	paid by investors and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the Offering. Net tangible book value
	per share is the net tangible assets of the Company (total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets), divided by the
	number of shares of common stock outstanding. As of the date of this prospectus, the Company’s net tangible per share book
	value was $0.0058. Thus if at some other time, shares had been sold by the Company at a price less than the $2.00 paid by purchasers
	of the Shares or had been issued by the Company for services or as other non-cash consideration, then the value of such investor
	Shares immediately after purchase would be less than the purchase price. The Company has issued shares prior to the date of this
	prospectus at a price less than $2.00.



	 




	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMMON STOCK



	 




	The Company’s stock price may
	be volatile.




	 


	The market price of the
	Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential
	factors, many of which will be beyond the Company’s control, including the following:


	 




	 



	·




	Competition;





	 



	·




	Additions or departures of key personnel;





	 



	·




	The Company’s ability to execute its business plan;





	 



	·




	Operating results that fall below expectations;





	 



	·




	SWCC Certification per AWEA 9.1 standard





	 



	·




	Loss of any strategic relationship;





	 



	·




	Industry developments;





	 



	·




	Economic and other external factors; and





	 



	·




	Period-to-period fluctuations in the Company’s financial
	results.





	 


	In addition, the securities
	markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance
	of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the Company’s
	common stock.


	 




	We do not expect to pay dividends in
	the foreseeable future.




	 


	We do not intend to declare
	dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth
	of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock, and stockholders may be
	unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you
	will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.


	 






	 



	16








	 




	 




	We may in the future issue additional
	shares of our common stock which would reduce investors’ ownership interests in the Company and which may dilute our share
	value.




	 


	Our Articles of Incorporation
	and amendments thereto authorize the issuance of 110,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The future issuance
	of all or part of our remaining authorized common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock
	held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance
	of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the
	shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.




	 


	 


	 






	An active trading market for our common
	stock may never develop or be sustained.




	 


	We cannot assure you that
	an active trading market for our Common Stock will develop in the future or, if developed, that any market will be sustained.
	Accordingly, you may be required to hold your Shares indefinitely or to sell them at a price that does not meet your expectations,
	if at all.




	 






	The Company’s stock may be considered
	a penny stock and any investment in the Company’s stock will be considered a high-risk investment and subject to restrictions
	on marketability.




	 


	If the Shares commence
	trading, the trading price of the Company's common stock may be below $5.00 per share. If the price of the common stock is below
	such level, trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades generally
	involving any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
	Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market
	and the risks associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to
	persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types of transactions, the
	broker-dealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent
	to the transactions before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers
	from effecting transactions in the Company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the Company’s common
	stock.


	 




	FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s
	ability to buy and sell our stock.




	 


	The Financial Industry
	Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) has adopted rules that relate to the application of the SEC’s penny stock rules
	in trading our securities and require that a broker/dealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable
	for that customer, prior to recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative, low priced securities to their
	non-institutional customers, broker/dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial
	status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.


	 


	Under interpretations
	of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low priced securities will not be suitable for
	at least some customers. FINRA’s requirements make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers
	buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock. Further,
	many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to
	make a market in our common stock, reducing a shareholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock.

	There has been no prior public market
	for the Company’s securities and the lack of such a market may make resale of the stock difficult.




	 


	No prior public market
	has existed for the Company’s securities and the Company cannot assure any investor that a market will develop subsequent
	to this offering. An investor must be fully aware of the long-term nature of an investment in the Company. The Company intends
	to apply for quotation of its common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board as soon as possible, which may be while this offering is
	still in process. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer,
	known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing (currently, the Company does
	not have an arrangement with any such market maker to qualify the Company’s securities for quotation on the OTC Bulletin
	Board). Moreover, the Company does not know if it will be successful in such application for quotation on the OTC bulletin board,
	how long such application will take, or, that if successful, that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue
	on the OTC Bulletin Board. If for any reason the common stock is not listed on the OTC Bulletin Board or a public trading market
	does not otherwise develop, investors in the offering may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do
	so. If the Company is not successful in its application for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, it will apply to have its securities
	quoted by the Pink OTC Markets, Inc., real-time quotation service for over-the-counter equities. 


	 




	Shares of common stock in the Company
	are subject to resale restrictions imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission



	.



	 


	The shares of common
	stock held by current shareholders are “restricted securities” subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities
	Act. In general, securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after being fully-paid and held for more than 6 months. Unregistered
	shares of the Company’s common stock held by current shareholders are subject to Rule 144 resale restrictions; provided,
	however, investors participating in the Offering are not subject to such resale limitations.



	 






	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	 


	This prospectus contains,
	in addition to historical information, certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
	Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially than those
	projected or anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Although
	the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot assure an investor
	that the forward-looking statements set out in this prospectus will prove to be accurate. The Company’s businesses can be
	affected by, without limitation, such things as natural disasters, economic trends, international strife or upheavals, consumer
	demand patterns, labor relations, existing and new competition, consolidation, and growth patterns within the industries in which
	the Company competes and any deterioration in the economy may individually or in combination impact future results.


	 






	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE




	 


	There is no public market
	for the Company’s common stock and the price at which the Shares are being offered has been arbitrarily determined by the
	Company. This price does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or other established criteria
	of value of the Company but represents solely the arbitrary opinion of management of the Company.

	(1)



	Offering expenses will not be paid from proceeds received
	from the offering.




	 









	(2)




	Audit fees are strictly related
	to the amount of work performed by our auditor, and the percentage of shares sold in this offering has no impact on our audit
	fees.  If we do not raise sufficient funds from this offering to cover audit related fees, we will have to seek additional
	outside financing to cover such expenses.





	 






	 



	19








	 




	   


	We believe that our current
	cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the sale of the maximum amount of shares
	being offered hereunder will only be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 18-24 months. Our management has
	determined that the maximum amount of funds received from this offering would be sufficient to cover our intended plan of operations
	contemplated hereby. The Company will use any proceeds received to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as
	well as to proceed with the Company’s intended business. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will raise
	any funds through its direct participation offering. As with any form of financing, there are uncertainties concerning the availability
	of such funds and the likelihood that such funds will be available to the Company on terms acceptable to us.


	 






	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; TERMS OF THE OFFERING




	 


	SkyWolf Wind Turbine Corporation
	has issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus 75,777,750 shares of Common Stock. The Company is registering
	an additional 1,500,000 shares of its Common Stock for sale at the price of $2.00 per share. There is no arrangement to address
	the possible effect of the Offering on the price of the stock.


	 


	In connection with the
	Company’s selling efforts in the Offering, our officers and directors will not register as broker-dealers pursuant to Section
	15 of the Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the “safe harbor” provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption
	from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate in
	an offering of the issuer’s securities. None of our officers or directors are subject to any statutory disqualification,
	as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act. Our officers and directors will not be compensated in connection
	with their participation in the offering by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly
	on transactions in our securities. Gerald Brock, our Chief Executive Officer, is not now and has not been within the past 12 months,
	a broker or dealer, and has not been within the past 12 months an associated person of a broker or dealer. At the end of the Offering,
	Mr. Brock will continue to perform substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection with transactions
	in securities. Mr. Brock will not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months
	other than in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii).


	 


	In order to comply with
	the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those states only if they have been
	registered or qualified for sale; an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available and with which
	the Company has complied. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company will be subject to applicable provisions,
	rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this Registration
	Statement is effective.


	 




	Offering Period and Expiration Date




	 


	This Offering will start
	on the date of this prospectus and continue for a period of up to 24 months, unless extended by our Board of Directors.


	 




	Procedures for Subscribing




	 


	If you decide to subscribe
	for any securities in this Offering, you must:


	 







	1.




	Execute and deliver a
	subscription agreement; and





	 







	2.




	Deliver a check, certified
	funds or cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds directly to the Company for acceptance or rejection (or to any such
	applicable broker-dealer or underwriter that may be engaged by the Company in connection with the offering in the future).





	 






	 



	20








	 




	 


	The subscription agreement
	requires you to disclose your name, address, social security number, telephone number, number of shares you are purchasing, and
	the price you are paying for your shares.


	 


	All checks for subscriptions
	must be made payable to

	SkyWolf Wind Turbine Corporation

	.




	 






	Acceptance of Subscriptions





	 



	Upon the Company’s
	acceptance of a Subscription Agreement and receipt of full payment, the Company shall countersign the Subscription Agreement and
	issue a stock certificate along with a copy of the Subscription Agreement.




	 






	Right to Reject Subscriptions




	 


	We have the right to accept
	or reject subscriptions in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions will be returned
	immediately by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Subscriptions for securities will be accepted or rejected
	within 48 hours after we receive them.


	 




	Penny Stock Regulation




	 


	The SEC has adopted rules
	that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities
	with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ
	system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the
	exchange or system).


	 


	The penny stock rules
	require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized
	risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that:


	 




	 



	·




	Contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the
	market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;





	 



	·




	Contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s
	duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such
	duties;





	 



	·




	Contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including
	“bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and
	ask price;





	 



	·




	Contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;





	 



	·




	Defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the
	conduct of trading penny stocks; and,





	 



	·




	Contains such other information and is in such form (including
	language, type, size, and format) as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.





	 


	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer
	with the following, prior to proceeding with any transaction in a penny stock:


	 




	 



	·




	Bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;





	 



	·




	Details of the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson
	in the transaction;





	 



	·




	The number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply,
	or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and,





	 



	·




	Monthly account statements showing the market value of each
	penny stock held in the customer’s account.





	 


	In addition, the penny
	stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must
	make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.


	 






	 



	21








	 




	 


	These disclosure requirements
	will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these
	penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities.




	 









	DILUTION




	 


	Net tangible book value
	per share represents the amount of the Company’s tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the 75,777,750 shares
	of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this registration statement. Net tangible book value dilution per share represents
	the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of the Shares in this Offering assuming the offering price of $2.00
	per share of Common Stock and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of Common Stock immediately after completion of
	the offering.


	 


	After giving effect to
	the sale of the 1,500,000 shares offered by the Company hereunder, at an Offering Price of $2.00 per share the pro forma net tangible
	book value of the Company as of the date of this registration statement, would have been $.033 per share, representing an immediate
	increase in tangible book value of $.0388 per share to existing shareholders and an immediate dilution of $(1.967) per share to
	purchasers of the Shares.


	 


	The following table illustrates the foregoing
	information with respect to new investors on a per share basis:

	DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY




	 


	Our principal executive
	office is located at 156 Court Street, Geneseo, NY 14454.  We currently rent this space for approximately $1,500 per month
	on a month to month basis.  Currently, this space is sufficient to meet our needs, however, once we expand our business to
	a significant degree, we will have to find a larger space. We do not foresee any significant difficulties in obtaining any required
	additional space.   We do not currently own any real property.

	Admission to Quotation on the OTC Bulletin
	Board




	 



	If the Company meets the
	qualifications, it intends to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board differs
	from national and regional stock exchanges in that it (1) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication
	of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers and (2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more broker-dealers
	rather than the "specialist" common to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity
	security must have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor
	the company listing. In addition, the Company must make available adequate current public information as required by applicable
	rules and regulations.


	 


	In certain cases the Company
	may elect to have its securities initially quoted in the Pink Sheets published by Pink OTC Markets Inc. In general there is greater
	liquidity for traded securities on the OTC Bulletin Board, and less through quotation on the Pink Sheets. It is not possible to
	predict where, if at all, the securities of the Company will be traded following the effectiveness of this registration statement.

	Penny Stock Regulation



	 


	Penny stocks generally
	are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share other than securities registered on national securities exchanges
	or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such
	securities are provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
	who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in
	excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by
	these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received
	the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny
	stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC
	relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
	the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent
	price information on the limited market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules, broker-dealers may be restricted
	in their ability to sell the Company’s common stock. The foregoing required penny stock restrictions will not apply to the
	Company’s common stock if such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share or greater.

	Business and Market
	Summary




	 



	After six years of research
	and development that resulted in three patents, SkyWolf made a major technological breakthrough with a patented Diffused Augmented
	Wind Turbine design (DAWT). The DAWT is capable of producing more energy output at lower wind speeds then conventional wind turbines
	and with a significantly smaller footprint. By reducing static pressure behind its rotor blades, the DAWT has been shown to exponentially
	increase efficiency and electric energy output by 50% or more as compared to conventional wind turbines of the same size. Adding
	Solar to the DAWT resulted in another patent for a Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine (aka HDAWT or “Hybrid”)
	that gives SkyWolf a distinct advantage in the renewable energy market by harnessing wind and solar energy simultaneously. SkyWolf’s
	design addresses the pitfalls and limitations of conventional wind turbines which represent a largely untapped market and a great
	business opportunity. Consumers with extremely rural or difficult sites or a varied mix of Solar/Wind energy will greatly benefit
	from the Hybrid design. SkyWolf’s improvements over small to medium sized wind turbine competitors are listed below:

	Adding Solar expands
	the number of usable sites and increases energy output.








	 


	The void in this market
	segment provides a unique opportunity that can only be filled by SkyWolf, setting the stage for substantial market penetration
	and subsequent sales. The most promising aspect of SkyWolf’s technology lies in the expansion of new sales from customers
	that are dissatisfied with the current limitations of conventional wind turbines. Only our Hybrid can extract both Wind and Solar
	energy simultaneously to give each customer the maximum amount of usable power every day regardless of site location or weather.
	Each Hybrid unit comes with a complete integrated system that captures, converts, and monitors wind and solar energy production
	which can be grid-tied or connected into a battery based system (off-grid). Our product is patent protected and is the only unit
	in the market that combines wind and solar in a unique and innovative design. The unique properties of the Hybrid gives consumers
	an alternative to larger and less efficient wind turbines and/or over-sized solar arrays. The added benefit of solar panels incorporated
	into our hybrid design allows the generation of power over a broader range of conditions. Our competitive price point perfectly
	positions the Hybrid nationally and internationally in the energy market. Additional state and federal tax credits assist in the
	sale and value of our Hybrid in the US market. The Company has secured sales in New York State in both the agricultural and residential
	markets. Plus preliminary negotiations are underway in Colombia, South America, South Africa, Peru, Mexico, and Europe totaling
	$1.5 Billion dollars or more in potential sales.


	 



	The Business: Wind-Solar Hybrid Turbines
	for Renewable Energy Generation




	 



	We believe that the renewable
	energy sector is stronger than ever. In fact, renewables outperformed all other sources of new electricity over the past five
	years, and garnered more than $44 billion is U.S. investment in 2015. Currently, the US is severely dependent on carbon based
	fuels for energy (as shown in the table below). The volatility of fossil fuel prices combined with negative environmental effects
	caused by pollution have spurred the development of a substantial market for solar and wind renewable energy. We believe that
	the negative effects of pollution coupled with fluctuating costs and uncertain supply associated with the generation of energy
	from fossil fuel sources has increased the demand for renewable energy sources.


	  





	 






	 



	26








	 




	 





	 


	One of the concerns with
	renewable energy is the low efficiency associated with converting to electrical power. In addition, the supply of these renewable
	energies is not consistent with the demand and the consistency of electrical energy output as it is currently produced and consumed.
	Solar panels can be utilized but the size of land area required to produce sufficient energy output is extremely large. In addition,
	locating panels on rooftops will decay the roof structure and provide unsightly visual appearance. Conventional wind turbines
	have been developed as an alternative, but the expansive footprint required by conventional wind turbines designs, as high as
	100 to 400 feet with large rotor diameters up to 35 feet, require extensive installation costs. In contrast, our Hybrid requires
	a much smaller footprint to produce the same amount of energy.


	 



	Conventional Wind Turbines Power Generation
	and Footprint



	 






	 



	We believe that SkyWolf
	made a major technological breakthrough with its Hybrid design. The reduction in size and jump in efficiency with the Hybrid eliminates
	several problems associated with wind turbines such as visual effects, noise, bird deaths and cost. SkyWolf's unique design opens
	up the market to residential areas, small businesses, farms, schools and municipalities, which we believe is an undersold market
	of approximately 41 million potential customers. The introduction of SkyWolf’s Hybrid to the green energy market will completely
	change the path to energy independence. This advanced technology opens the door to affordable, clean power throughout the world.

	We are currently in the
	market commercialization and business development phase of our product where we are executing market strategies and commercialization
	by attending key conferences and tradeshows sponsored by New York Power Authority (NYPA) and SUNY Sustainability as well as advertising
	in the New York State Association Counties (NYSAC) magazine. As new orders are secured, expansion will require additional staff
	resources and additional facility site. We intend to participate in several government programs to off-set this expansion cost
	and effectively assist our growth.



	 




	The Marketplace



	 


	The capacity for alternative
	energy has been growing at a significant rate. Wind power in the U.S. is now the largest source of renewable generating capacity,
	and has provided 30% of all new capacity installed over the past five years. Wind power provided 27% of electricity generating
	capacity added to the U.S. system in 2016. Within the US there are now 18 states that have over 1,000 MW of installed capacity.
	Those states are: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, California, Kansas, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, North Dakota,
	Indiana, New York, Michigan, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Nebraska and New Mexico. Another 16 states have 100 MW to 1,000 MW of wind
	power capacity. 9 states produce between 10% to 20% of their electricity with wind power, 3 states produce over 20%, and another
	2 states produce over 30%. The U.S. has approximately 5.5% of its power supplied by wind as of the end of 2016 and is on a clear
	path to increase its energy independence utilizing wind power along with other sources of green energy.

	As part of our initial
	commercialization strategy, our early target markets include customers located in New York State, specifically governmental entities
	acting in compliance with New York State Clean Energy Standard and Executive Order (EO) 88, customers in the Finger Lakes region
	and customers in the international market. We will focus on the market segment for wind turbines under 100 kWs with sales of $191M
	in this segment in the US during the period 2014 - 2015. This market is primarily defined by units that range in size from 3 to
	20 kWs, which apply to both residential and commercial customers. Both of these groups are generally grid-tied to the local utility
	which gives them the ability to sell their excess power when supply exceeds demand. Specifically, potential markets are: farms,
	government buildings, secondary schools, colleges, commercial buildings, RV parks, marinas, municipalities, military installations
	and residential customers. This represents approximately 41.7 million potential customers based primarily on census data. This
	segment represents a great business opportunity and largely untapped market since growth has been hampered by the limitations
	of conventional wind turbine designs.

	SkyWolf exhibited at Germany’s
	2016 Hannover Messe, the World’s leading trade fair for industrial technology, which covers the manufacturing and energy
	sectors. Exhibiting at this fair connected us to approximately 200,000 attendees from 70 countries comprised of 100 business delegations.
	In addition, we have received strong interest from companies located in other regions such as Africa, Mexico, Afghanistan, and
	Asia. We are also in discussion with a manufacturer located in China that will allow fabrication, sales, and delivery of our products
	to that region.


	 



	Our Products: Solar
	Hybrid Wind Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine



	 


	 The basic premise
	of a wind turbine is to extract energy out of airflow which is created by the unequal heating of the earth. Wind turbines convert
	the kinetic energy from wind into mechanical power that runs a generator. When wind blows past a turbine, the blades capture energy
	and rotate. This rotation triggers an internal shaft to spin, which is connected to a gearbox that is connected to a generator
	ultimately producing electricity.


	 


	The SkyWolf Hybrid model
	has six turbine blades mounted for rotation about a longitudinal axis on a rotating hub. Ideally, the blade length will extend
	almost all the way to the inner side of the front diffuser, which surrounds the blades. The shape is conical and has an upstream
	and downstream opening. A backside section extends from the front diffuser and is used to assemble the parts used to enhance airflow.
	Because the plates are discontinuous, there are gaps between adjacent plates. Consequently, the air exiting the downstream opening
	and air moving through the axial air passage under the plates are mixed and a portion of the mixed air exits through the gaps.
	Pulling air outward from the interior airflow path reduces pressure behind the rotor blades which increases air flow and enhances
	the extraction of kinetic energy from the air path. The plates are tilted away from the axis of rotation of the blades which allows
	the wind turbine to turn into the direction of the wind and helps boost extraction efficiency. In order to fully optimize the
	extraction of wind energy, a special rotor blade was designed specifically for SkyWolf's wind turbine. Each blade design option
	(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8 blades) was methodically tested utilizing a Campbell Scientific CR800 data logger with a certified AWEA
	Anemometer before establishing 6 blades was the optimum design for our wind turbine.



	 




	Prototype Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine
	Design



	 





	 






	 



	35








	 




	 


	In 2013, the idea and
	design to include solar panels in replacement of the directional plates optimized the ability to capture both wind and solar renewable
	energies. This break-through in design led to the introduction in late 2014 of eight bi-facial solar panels to give us our current
	SkyWolf Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind Turbine (aka HDAWT or Hybrid) model.


	  



	Current Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented
	Wind Turbine (HDAWT) Design



	 





	 


	In order to fully optimize the extraction
	of kinetic energy from wind, SkyWolf has designed four critical parts listed below that operate as a single, highly efficient
	system:


	 




	 



	·




	The forward Diffuser made from polypropylene w/woven glass fiber,
	channels the air flow into the specially designed light weight cast aluminum turbine blades and augments the wind through
	the bifacial solar panels that allow for rotation at speeds as low as 5 mph and up to 60 mph;





	 



	·




	A carbon steel housing Pivot Hub with tempered steel pivot shaft,
	and heavy duty conical roller bearings (greased) constantly positions the turbine in the head wind;





	 



	·




	The addition of eight bi-facial solar panels collects solar
	energy on both surfaces while continuously aligning turbine with head wind; and





	 



	·




	The attached back section incorporates a design that pulls additional
	air away from the interior air path and prevents a stall point so air can flow freely.





	 


	The Hybrid has been designed
	as a simple, modular system which is shipped in 20’ ocean freight containers directly to the job-site eliminating the need
	for expensive, temporary storage. The product is listed under NAIC 221115 and SIC 3511.


	 


	Each unit includes control
	panels used to capture the electrical energy produced, interface with AC, invert DC to AC, tie it into the grid, provide safety
	control, and continually monitor the wind turbine at the site. A typical control panel layout is depicted below:

	CONTROL PANEL



	 





	 


	A power curve measures
	the usable power extracted from wind at all of the various wind speeds experienced by a wind turbine.

	POWER CURVE



	 





	 






	 



	38








	 




	  


	Conventional wind turbines
	extract usable power in the range of 6 to 31 mph, while SkyWolf's range is 5 - 60 mph, which creates a significant increase in
	total output power. Representative power curves are shown for both types of wind turbines in the above graph. Because SkyWolf’s
	Hybrid is extremely more efficient at extracting power from wind, each data point represents more power than conventional wind
	turbines can extract. However, there is a dramatic gain in output power above 26 mph which often happens during storms and shifts
	in pressure fronts. Consequently, SkyWolf’s product does not have the limitations experienced by traditionally designed
	wind turbines and produces usable power over the entire range of 5 - 60 mph. This is only achievable by SkyWolf and dramatically
	differentiates our product from our competitors in the marketplace.



	 




	Intellectual Property and Patents Awarded



	 


	SkyWolf holds the following patents which have
	been issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO):

	date April 17, 2012.




	 



	Product Development




	 



	The design and testing
	for the current 3.5kW Solar Hybrid (HDAWT) is complete and the Company is in the design phase for releasing an additional model
	which features a 5.0kW generator. Design and testing of the larger size unit are proceeding and the extent of design changes are
	expected to be minimal. Consequentially, the company expects this model to be available later this year. The Company believes
	that by introducing a larger scale model of the Hybrid, it will be well positioned to expand sales into market segments requiring
	more energy.


	 



	Pricing




	 



	The Company anticipates
	offering its products at an average sales price of $45,000 in quantities of 1-10, which we believe is a market-competitive price.
	Quantity discounts are available for 11- 30 and 30+ size orders. Given the small physical size, efficient energy output and ease
	of installation (with no additional guide wires) our products are competitive with similar turbines. However, as sales volumes
	increase, cost savings of 15% - 20% will be anticipated and passed on to customers through price reductions which will stimulate
	sales.



	 






	Competition




	 



	We currently do not compete
	with wind turbine manufacturers, such as GE and Siemens, who sell large 100 foot to 300 foot wind turbine structures commonly
	utilized on new commercial wind farm applications. On the other hand, we do compete against small to medium wind turbine manufacturers,
	such as Bergey, Eocycle, Endurance and Kingspan, who manufacture wind turbines for residential and commercial markets. However,
	other than our Hybrid, there is no other competing technology in the world that combines both wind and solar in one turbine giving
	us a very distinctive advantage.


	  






	 



	39

	Although any of the 19
	referenced companies may compete with SkyWolf, 15 of them currently have negligible market share. Four of the remaining companies
	have good market penetration and experience in the wind turbine business and stand out as primary competition for SkyWolf. Bergey,
	Kingspan, and Xzeres have been instrumental in developing wind power and introducing it to the market. Without them, wind power
	would probably not have developed to the current level. However, both companies as well as the others have peaked out development-wise
	and are experiencing less and less return on each engineering dollar spent. Most of Bergey, Kingspan, and Xzeres's sales are based
	on brand, length of time in the business, and the lack of alternatives in the market place. At this juncture, it would take a
	bold step forward for them to make a significant impact in this technology. SkyWolf’s Hybrid design is unique and stands
	alone in the industry and marketplace since it’s the only patented wind turbine manufacturer to achieve energy generation
	from both wind and solar sources.



	 




	Strategic Partners and Suppliers



	 


	The Company believes that
	strategic partnerships will be a major component of the Company’s operating strategy and path to success. Currently, several
	strategic partnerships include our Solar Panel, Turbine Generator, and proprietary Control Panel Equipment supplier. These relationships
	provide critical services and products that assist SkyWolf with proposals and solutions that help secure business. Some of the
	other partnerships and industry collaboration include but are not limited to:

	the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Ferchale Trading SAC to represent SkyWolf Solar Hybrid Wind
	Turbine products in the territory of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. Ferchale Trading specializes in electric energy infrastructure
	in the mining, textile, and petrochemical industries. They have extensive contacts with the Peruvian Government Energy and Mining
	Board, and utility companies.



	 



	On July 27, 2016, the
	Company has engaged Apfelpbrum Industrial Inc. to solicit and secure opportunities in Mexico and South America. They have presented
	our product to the Foxconn Corporation.



	 



	In April 2015, the
	Company met with representatives of RENDEAVOUR Development to discuss a Request for Procurement (RFP) for a Phase 1 & 2 Photovoltaic
	Energy Facility in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Company received the RFP and initiated discussion with
	SEWW Energy (a global minority firm that develops and operates sustainable energy and healthcare solutions) who has been commissioned
	by the US government to facilitate Power Africa programs.



	 



	The Company had discussed
	and applied to the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), Power Africa grant applications for a $1.5M energy feasibility study
	in Ghana.


	 



	Operations



	 


	The Company currently
	has six full-time employees, not including independent sales consultants. The Company is currently located in a 5,000 sq. ft.
	building in Geneseo, NY which houses the Company’s administrative offices and manufacturing facility. The Company develops,
	market, sells, manufactures and ships its wind turbine products from this facility. The Company also offers field service support
	and installation training. The Company offers a 20-year limited warranty with respect to the turbines that it plans to sell. The
	Company also offers and performs Feasibility Studies to determine energy use and optimum site location.


	 


	With the completion of
	design and testing of the Hybrid, SkyWolf is conducting operations to implement our commercial market strategies. Additional sales
	channels are being developed as the Company grows. Some additional independent representatives have been added, notably in South
	America and pending in Africa, Australia, Mexico, Caribbean, and the Middle East. We are also partnering with Empire State Development
	(ESD) to assist us with Global New York (http://global.ny.gov/) grant applications to expand our sales channels both domestically
	and internationally. The Hybrid represents a High Tech commercial product that is sold typically through a solicitation or procurement
	by a State of Work (SOW) or Request for Proposals (RFP) from larger institutions.



	 




	Sales and Marketing



	 


	The Company has executed
	its initial market commercialization strategies in advertising and marketing starting in September 2015. However, since the primary
	focus of the Company since inception has been to obtain all of the primary patents and finalize a design, the current marketing
	strategy continues to evolve as products enter the marketplace. Our initial sales channel will be direct sales and through targeted
	tradeshows and industry conferences. Additional sales engineers and market managers will be hired to target these specific market
	segments and territories. Therefore, the company is starting to obtain and identify key independent representation with pre-existing
	contacts in globally expanding markets that desperately need renewable energy. The Company will monitor initial sales ensuring
	a smooth transition into the market has been established before implementing the full sales plan.

	The commercial launch
	of SkyWolf’s Hybrid began with a review and research of impacting energy associations, conferences, municipal partners,
	tradeshows, and government agencies that impact, monitor, or utilize renewable energy technologies. To introduce and increase
	our product exposure we have elected to participate, attend, and partner with several targeted organizations as follows:


	 



	Government Agencies



	 


	The following governmental
	agencies govern, establish, and promote renewable energy technologies in New York State. We have relied upon certain initiatives
	and programs implemented by these agencies, such as EO 88 and the New York State Clean Energy Standard, to assist in the development
	of our business and identify key sales channels.


	 





	 



	Municipal Partners Conferences and Trade Shows



	 


	Recently there is a rapid
	initiative for counties to establish alternative energy resources for their communities with escalating utility costs. SkyWolf
	plans to join the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) as well as place advertisements in their quarterly news magazine
	that provides us access to 63 counties and 5,000 members in county government.


	 


	SkyWolf has strategically
	targeted specific tradeshows that will highlight our product and provide maximum exposure to key markets, industries, and decision
	makers. NYPA has recently established a Build Smart program which holds an annual Innovation Summit that allowed SkyWolf to showcase
	their new Hybrid. In addition, the State University New York (SUNY) holds an annual sustainability conference that provided SkyWolf
	with the connection of 64 college universities looking to establish sustainable programs.

	As outlined in our market
	strategy map, with Executive Order 88 in place, New York State has been identified as the target region to immediately secure
	and execute initial sales. The low cost of penetration, physical proximity to our production facility and current resources makes
	NYS a cost effective sales launch for the Hybrid.


	 


	The market for wind turbines
	under 100kW's is a segment that fits perfectly into the SkyWolf product line. Wind turbine sales in this segment of the market
	from 2003 to the end of 2015 were 75,000 units totaling 934 MW’s of power. This market is primarily defined by units that
	range in size from 3 to 20kW's, which apply to both residential and commercial customers. Both of these groups are generally grid-tied
	to the local utility which gives them the ability to sell their excess power when supply exceeds demand.


	 


	In review of our market
	strategy map, given the low cost to penetrate, several government programs, a Governor executed executive order, high industry
	demand for alternative clean energy, expedient expectations for clean energy products, and close proximity to our plant, SkyWolf
	has decided to target New York State commercial and public sector applications. These commercial applications will provide quantity
	and scale and include:


	 




	 



	-




	Government facilities and buildings (i.e.; correctional facilities,
	colleges and universities, etc)





	 



	-




	Municipal Counties and Towns and Villages





	 



	-




	Mission Critical Infrastructure to include Hospitals, DOT, Communication
	Centers, etc.





	 



	-




	Airports





	 



	-




	Industry





	 



	-




	Small Business Owner





	 



	-




	Farms to include winery, organic crops, and cattle





	 


	Residential applications
	may apply but until tax credits can be obtained by completing a NYSERDA certification per Small Wind Certification Council (SWCC),
	scalable quantities will not be recognized. The void in these commercial market segments provide a unique opportunity for scalable
	and subsequent sales of our Hybrid product.


	 


	Additional demand for
	Micro-Grid applications by developing countries and municipalities have developed as they seek to implement technologies for their
	critical energy needs. The Hybrid is an ideal fit for both municipalities and off-grid applications in more rural areas in developing
	countries. This is an exciting opportunity for the Hybrid and interest has increased dramatically since it was introduced internationally
	leading to $1.5B in potential sales and $11M

	Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act




	 



	In April, 2012, the Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act") was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:


	 


	Exemptions for emerging
	growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of
	financing to small companies;


	 


	Amendments to certain
	provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders
	required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;


	 


	Relaxation of the general
	solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;


	 


	Adoption of a new exemption
	for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and


	 


	Exemption from registration
	by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC
	pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering
	requirements.


	 


	In general, under the
	JOBS Act, a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ("IPO") of common equity securities
	was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed
	fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of


	 


	(i) the completion of
	the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,


	 


	(ii) the completion of
	the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO;


	 


	(iii) the company's issuance
	of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or


	 


	(iv) the company becoming
	a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	The JOBS Act provides
	additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact
	the Company are discussed below.


	 



	Financial Disclosure.

	The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of
	1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:


	 


	(i) audited financial
	statements required for only two fiscal years;


	 


	(ii) selected financial
	data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;


	 


	(iii) executive compensation
	only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.


	 






	 



	46








	 




	 


	(A smaller reporting company
	is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter).


	 


	However, the requirements
	for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain
	of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting
	company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial
	statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.


	 


	The JOBS Act also exempts
	the Company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board ("PCAOB") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.


	 


	The JOBS Act also exempts
	an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company's accounting firm or
	for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.


	 



	Internal Control Attestation.

	The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm
	to file a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required
	to file its report on the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	Section 102(a) of the
	JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies
	with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.



	 




	Other Items of the
	JOBS Act.

	The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified
	institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after
	the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an
	emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the
	JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential
	investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.


	 


	Section 106 of the JOBS
	Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration
	statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to
	allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go
	public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.


	 



	Election to Opt Out
	of Transition Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with
	new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration
	statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the
	new or revised financial accounting standard.


	 


	The JOBS Act provides
	a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
	companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.

	PLAN OF OPERATION




	 




	Business Plan




	 



	The Company is an early-stage
	company, starting to generate sales and revenue by implementing its market commercialization strategies to continue to design,
	develop, market, manufacture and sell its Hybrid wind turbine in regional, national and international markets.


	 



	In
	the future, the Company plans to increase revenue and raise capital to support its plan of operations. The Company also plans
	to raise capital under this Offering


	and use the proceeds of to obtain certification by the
	Small Wind Certification Council (SWCC), and European CE marking, add additional staff required to grow the Company, including
	positions in sales, marketing and administration, working capital and to fund research and development activities to create new
	applications, such as a hydro unit.



	 


	From the beginning, the
	Company has adopted a cash basis policy to ensure no debt would accumulate and leverage the developing business. Terms of our
	orders include a 60% down payment which is used to pay for all of the parts required to fill the order. 30% payment is required
	upon shipment of the order and the remaining 10% is paid by our customers when the wind turbine is deemed operational. Gross profits
	are between 10 to 30% per unit and the overhead costs for the current business model is minimal $250,000 annually. Since all vendors
	are paid in full from opening order deposits, overhead still needs to be covered and with normal delays in start-up due to issues
	with shipping, construction and weather. Further, taking into account cancelled orders and some start-up issues due to a defective
	part, we project that we need to sell at least approximately 35-45 units per year in order to meet our annual businesses expenses.


	 



	Potential Revenue



	 


	We have begun limited
	production in late 2015 at our current facility and have sold 3 units in 2016 in NY State. During the fiscal year ended December
	31, 2016, the Company generated revenues of $99,800. We anticipate securing an additional order for 6 units totaling $320,000
	in early 2017. This projection is based on an average sales price of $45,000 per unit.





	 








	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
	OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 



	The following discussion of our financial
	condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes to the financial
	statements included elsewhere in this Registration Statement.  Some of the statements under “Management’s Discussion
	and Analysis,” “Description of Business” and elsewhere herein may include forward-looking statements which reflect
	our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These statements include forward-looking statements
	both with respect to us specifically and the renewable energy industry in general. Statements which include the words “expect,”
	“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “project,” “anticipate,” “will,”
	and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements for purposes of the federal securities
	laws or otherwise. The safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws do not apply to any forward-looking statements contained
	in this Registration Statement. All forward-looking statements address such matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly,
	there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these
	statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
	information, future developments or otherwise. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our
	underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. Any forward-looking statements
	you read herein reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties
	and assumptions relating to our written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or individuals acting on our behalf
	and such statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph.



	 


	The Company is an early-stage
	company and was incorporated in the State of New York in 2010. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated
	revenues of $99,800 and incurred operating losses of $471,943 as part of its operating activities.


	 






	 



	48








	 




	 


	We believe that our
	current cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the sale of the maximum amount
	of shares being offered hereunder will only be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 18-24 months. Our management
	has determined that the maximum amount of funds received from this offering would be sufficient to cover our intended plan of
	operations contemplated hereby.


	 



	Results of Operation



	 



	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to
	the three months ended March 31, 2016




	 



	Total revenue for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 was $0 and $0, respectively. We had not realized any revenues during these
	periods because we recently shifted the focus of our operations from the research and development phase of launching our product
	to the marketing and commercialization phase.


	 


	Total operating expenses
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $174,114, which was comprised of $0 in research and development expenses, $104,630
	in compensations and benefits and $69,484 in other general and administrative expenses. In comparison, total operating expenses
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $125,701, which was comprised of $2,070 in research and development expenses, $85,049
	in compensations and benefits and $38,582 in other general and administrative expenses. The overall increase in operating expenses
	can be attributed to the Company’s shift in its operating activities from its focus on research and development activities
	to increases in costs related to the commercialization of its Hybrid product.


	 



	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015




	 



	Total revenue for the twelve months ended December
	31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $99,800 and $0, respectively. The increase in our revenues in 2016 is related to the shift
	in our operating activities towards the commercialization of our product. In 2015, we had not realized any revenues because we
	were still in the research and development phase of launching our product.


	 


	Total operating expenses
	for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $509,164, which was comprised of $2,763 in research and development expenses,
	$345,810 in compensations and benefits and $160,591 in other general and administrative expenses. In comparison, total operating
	expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $711,872, which was comprised of $164,884 in research and development
	expenses, $290,939 in compensations and benefits and $256,049 in other general and administrative expenses. The overall decrease
	in operating expenses can be attributed to the Company’s shift in its operating activities from its focus on research and
	development activities to the commercialization of its Hybrid product.



	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 



	As of March 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016




	 



	Our balance sheet as
	at March 31, 2017 reflects $144,717 in cash, as compared to $3,859 as of December 31, 2016. The increase in liquidity reflects
	proceeds received from sales of the Company’s common stock.


	 



	As of December 31, 2016 as compared to as of December 31,
	2015




	 



	Our balance sheet as at December
	31, 2016 reflects $3,859 in cash, as compared to $100,486 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in liquidity reflects expenditures
	related to the Company’s operating expenses.



	 




	Cash Flow from Operating Activities



	 



	For the three months ended March 31,
	2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016

	 


	 


	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2017, the cash flows used in the Company’s operating activities was $134,929. The cash flows used in the
	Company’s operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $136,976. The change in the use of cash flows
	for operating activities between these periods is not significant for the purposes of comparison.


	 






	 



	49








	 




	 



	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015



	 


	During the 12 months
	ended December 31, 2016, the cash flows used in the Company’s operating activities was $425,724. The cash flows used in
	the Company’s operating activities for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2015 was $745,131. The decrease in the
	use of cash flows for operating activities can be attributed to the Company’s shift in its operating activities from its
	focus on research and development activities to the commercialization of its Hybrid product.


	 



	Cash Flow from Investing Activities





	 





	For the three months ended March 31,
	2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016



	 


	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2017, the net cash used in investing activities by the Company was $0. The net cash used in investing activities
	by the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2016, was $0.


	 



	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015



	 


	During the twelve months
	ended December 31, 2016, the net cash used in investing activities by the Company was $0. The net cash used in investing activities
	by the Company for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015, was $50,241. The decrease in the use of cash flow for investing
	activities is related to decreases in purchases of property and equipment and similar expenses.


	 



	Cash Flow from Financing Activities



	 



	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to
	the three months ended March 31, 2016



	 


	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2017, the net cash provided by financing activities by the Company was $275,787. The net cash provided by financing
	activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $136,562. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is
	related to increases in proceeds received from sales of our common stock.


	 



	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015



	 


	During the twelve month
	period ended December 31, 2016, the net cash provided by financing activities by the Company was $329,097. The net cash provided
	by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $739,126. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities
	is related to decreases in proceeds received from sales of our stock.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	We have not attained profitable
	operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons,
	our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able
	to continue as a going concern without further financing.


	 



	Contractual Obligations



	 


	We are a smaller reporting
	company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under
	this item.


	 



	Future Financings




	 



	We will continue to rely
	on equity sales of our common shares and debt proceeds in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional
	shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the
	equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.


	 






	 



	50








	 





	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no significant
	off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
	that are material to stockholders.


	 



	Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
	and Financial Disclosure





	 




	Other than the disclosure
	of uncertainty regarding the ability for us to continue as a going concern which was included in our accountant’s report
	on the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015; Anton & Chia LLP’s reports on the financial
	statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
	opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.


	 


	In connection with the
	audit and review of the financial statements of the Company through December 31, 2016, there were no disagreements on any matter
	of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if
	not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with Anton & Chia's opinion to the
	subject matter of the disagreement.


	 


	In connection with the
	audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there have been no reportable events
	with the Company as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.


	 


	The Company provided a
	copy of the foregoing disclosures to Anton & Chia LLP prior to the date of filing of this Registration Statement on Form S-1,
	and requested that Anton & Chia LLP furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities & Exchange Commission stating
	whether or not it agreed with the statements in this Registration Statement on Form S-1. A copy of the letter furnished in response
	to that request is filed herewith.




	 





	Critical Accounting Policies





	 




	Our financial statements
	and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on
	a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	periods.


	 


	We regularly evaluate
	the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are
	based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed
	to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.




	 





	Use of Estimates

	– The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash

	– For
	financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities
	of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts,
	which at times may exceed federally-insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk as a
	result of any non-performance by the financial institution.


	 



	Inventory

	–
	Inventory consists of completed turbines and unassembled parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. The Company
	capitalizes applicable direct and indirect costs incurred in inventory production.


	 






	 



	51








	 





	 




	Property and Equipment

	– Property and equipment consists of software and equipment. Depreciation is recorded on accelerated methods over periods
	considered by management to be the assets' useful lives. Expenditures for repairs, minor items and maintenance are charged to
	operations as incurred. Any gain or loss upon sale or retirement due to obsolescence is recorded in operating results in the period
	it takes place. Software is being depreciated over three years and equipment is being depreciated over five years.


	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived
	Assets

	– Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of
	the carrying amount of an asset to future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, including its ultimate
	disposition. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
	the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or
	appraised values, depending on the nature of the asset.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial
	Instruments

	– The carrying value of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates
	of their fair value due to their short maturity. The carrying value of loans from the principal shareholder depends on the Company's
	ability to generate cash.


	 



	Revenue Recognition

	– Revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement,
	(2) a service or product has been provided to a customer, (3) the sale price to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable,
	and (4) collection of the sale price is reasonably assured. Amounts collected prior to satisfying these conditions are recorded
	as customer deposits.



	 




	Allowance For Doubtful
	Accounts

	– as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 there are no anticipated bad debts so an allowance for doubtful accounts
	was not recorded.


	 



	Advertising Costs

	– Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs were $16,133 and $17,668 for the years ended 2016 and
	2015, respectively, and are included in other general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations.


	 



	Research and Development
	Costs

	– All costs of research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs
	consist of expenses for inventing and testing turbine prototypes, including the materials and other direct costs of constructing
	prototype turbines, as well as related equipment employed in research and development activity.


	 



	Income Taxes

	–
	The Company accounts for income taxes using the "asset and liability approach." That requires recognition of deferred
	tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and
	the tax basis of assets and liabilities. This method uses statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences
	are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred assets are recognized,
	net of any valuation allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income
	tax expense for a year is the net change in that year's deferred asset and liability balances.


	 


	The Company has a deferred
	tax asset for potential future tax savings of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. However, due to the uncertainty
	of future profits to absorb the carryforwards, an equal valuation allowance reduces the value of the deferred tax asset to zero.


	 



	Deferred Revenue –
	Customer Deposits

	– The Company has received $40,000 in deposits for sales orders that are in process as of December
	31, 2016.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Loss
	per Share

	– Basic earnings or loss per share reflect the weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the
	period. Diluted earnings per share are computed including the additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential
	shares (option or warrant shares, for example) were issued. No dilutive potential shares exist.

	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	In November 2016, the
	FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash” (“ASU
	2016-18”). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying guidance on classification
	and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual and interim
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively
	to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18, which will only impact the Company
	if it has restricted cash in the future.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”
	(“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented
	and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The
	new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required
	to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
	the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its condensed financial statements.


	 


	In August 2014, the FASB
	issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
	about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”. This standard is intended to define management’s
	responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern
	and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the
	reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under
	this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical
	to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently,
	U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization’s
	ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization’s
	management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that
	are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods
	ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application
	is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company
	is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.


	 


	Other recent accounting
	pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.




	 




	The Company has implemented
	all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
	unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have
	been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	Director Independence



	 


	Pursuant to Rule 4200
	of The NASDAQ Stock Market one of the definitions of an independent director is a person other than an executive officer or employee
	of a company. The Company's board of directors has reviewed the materiality of any relationship that each of the directors has
	with the Company, either directly or indirectly. Based on this review, the board has determined that there are no independent
	directors.

	The Company has assembled
	an advisory board. The following individuals serve at the Company’s discretion on such board:

	55








	 





	 




	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings



	 


	None of our directors
	or executive officers has, during the past ten years:


	 




	 



	•




	Been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a
	pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences);





	 




	 



	•




	Had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business
	or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or
	executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;





	 




	 



	•




	Been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently
	reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily
	enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities,
	investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;





	 




	 



	•




	Been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action
	or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law,
	and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	Been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state
	judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including
	any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities
	or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including,
	but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary
	or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud
	or fraud in connection with any business entity; or





	 




	 



	•




	Been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not
	subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange
	Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), any





	 




	 



	•




	Registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity
	Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29)), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority
	over its members or persons associated with a member.





	 
	 


	Except as set forth in
	our discussion below in “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, none of our directors, director nominees or executive
	officers has been involved in any transactions with us or any of our directors, executive officers, affiliates or associates which
	are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.



	 




	Independence of Directors



	 


	We have no independent
	directors. Mr. Gerald Brock, our sole director, is not an independent director because he is also an officer of the Company.


	 



	 


	Committees of the Board



	 


	Our Company currently
	does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have
	a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Directors believe that it is not necessary to have such committees,
	at this time, because the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of such committees.


	 


	Our Company does not have
	any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The Board
	of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
	assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or
	minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for
	evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders,
	and make recommendations for election or appointment.


	 






	 



	56








	 




	 


	A shareholder who wishes
	to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President and Director, at
	the address appearing on the first page of this filing.


	 



	Risk Oversight



	 


	Effective risk oversight
	is an important priority of the Board of Directors. Because risks are considered in virtually every business decision, the Board
	of Directors discusses risk throughout the year generally or in connection with specific proposed actions. The Board of Directors’
	approach to risk oversight includes understanding the critical risks in the Company’s business and strategy, evaluating
	the Company’s risk management processes, allocating responsibilities for risk oversight among the full Board of Directors,
	and fostering an appropriate culture of integrity and compliance with legal responsibilities.


	 



	Corporate Governance



	 


	The Company promotes accountability
	for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
	reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives
	to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code
	of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company’s employees, officers and Directors as the Company is not required
	to do so.


	 


	In lieu of an Audit Committee,
	the Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside
	auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements and other services
	provided by the Company’s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors reviews the Company's internal accounting
	controls, practices and policies.


	 



	Code of Ethics



	 


	Our Board of Directors
	has not adopted a code of ethics. We anticipate that we will adopt a code of ethics when we increase either the number of our
	Directors or the number of our employees.

	Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table



	 


	We have an employment
	agreement with Mr. Paul Morrell, our Vice President of Business Development. No other employees have employment agreements with
	the Company. The compensation discussed herein addresses all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our named executive
	officers. There are no other stock option plans, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans for the benefit of our officers
	and directors other than as described herein.


	 



	Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End




	 



	There are no current outstanding
	equity awards to our executive officers as of December 31, 2016.  


	  



	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance



	 


	Section 16(a) of the Exchange
	Act may require our executive officers and Directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports
	of ownership and change in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the exchange on which the common stock is
	listed for trading. Executive officers, Directors and more than ten percent (10%) stockholders are required by regulations promulgated
	under the Exchange Act to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports filed. Based solely on our review of copies of the
	Section 16(a) reports filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we believe that our executive officers, Directors and
	ten percent (10%) stockholders complied with all reporting requirements applicable to them.




	 






	Director Compensation



	 


	Our Board of Directors
	does not currently receive any consideration for their services as members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reserves
	the right in the future to award the members of the Board of Directors cash or stock based consideration for their services to
	the Company, which awards, if granted shall be in the sole determination of the Board of Directors.


	 



	Executive Compensation Philosophy



	 


	Our Board of Directors
	determines the compensation given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors also reserves
	the right to pay our executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock issued in consideration for services rendered
	and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer’s
	performance. This package may also include long-term stock based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align
	the performance of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, the Board of Directors reserves the right
	to grant stock options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination believes such grants would be in the best interests
	of the Company.


	 



	Incentive Bonus



	 


	The Board of Directors
	may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officers in its sole discretion, if the Board of Directors believes such bonuses
	are in the Company’s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and growth, if any, and the amount of
	revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability of such executives.


	 






	 



	58








	 





	 




	Long-term, Stock Based Compensation



	 


	In order to attract, retain
	and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company’s long-term business strategy we may award certain executives
	with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, which we do not currently
	have any immediate plans to award. 



	 







	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
	OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT



	 


	The following table sets
	forth, as of the date of this Prospectus, the number and percentage of outstanding shares of our common stock owned by: (a) each
	person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock; and (b) all
	current directors and executive officers, as a group.


	 


	As of the date of this
	Prospectus, and including the securities described above, there were 75,777,750 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.


	  


	Beneficial ownership has
	been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially
	owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition,
	shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise
	of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
	of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such
	acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily
	reflect the person’s actual voting power at any particular date.


	 


	To our knowledge, except
	as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, the persons named in the table
	have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them.

	(1)


	Under Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
	a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
	relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares;
	and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed
	to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of
	the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares
	(for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the
	percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such
	person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
	AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE




	 





	Transactions with Related Persons



	 


	In the past, the Company
	has taken loans from a related party, Gerald Brock. Currently, the Company owes, as of December 31, 2016, loan amounts due to
	Mr. Brock in the amount of $446,000.


	 


	In 2016 and 2015 the
	Company advanced an affiliate $10,746 and $15,824, respectively, for operating expenses. The affiliate has been dissolved as of
	September 30, 2016. The advance of $15,824 was written off and included in other general and administrative expenses on the statements
	of operation during the year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	In addition, the Company
	has a vendor that it contracts business with who is related to the majority shareholder. The vendor is also a shareholder of the
	Company. For the year ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, this vendor was paid $15,680 and $41,126 respectively, for contractor
	services.


	 


	The following shares were
	issued to, and are currently held by, persons related to Gerald Brock (an officer and director of the Company):


	 


	Richard Brock, Mr. Gerald
	Brock’s brother, was issued 115,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.


	 


	Melissa Brock and James
	Cucinotta, Mr. Gerald Brock’s niece and her husband, were collectively issued 105,000 shares of the Company’s common
	stock.


	 


	Other than the foregoing,
	none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially
	more than 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares of its common stock, nor any associate or affiliate of such persons or
	companies, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past fiscal year, or
	in any proposed transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company.



	  





	Review, Approval and Ratification of Related Party Transactions



	 


	Given our small size and
	limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of transactions,
	such as those described above, with our executive officers, Directors and significant stockholders. However, all of the transactions
	described above were approved and ratified by our Board of Directors. In connection with the approval of the transactions described
	above, our Board of Directors, took into account several factors, including their fiduciary duties to the Company; the relationships
	of the related parties described above to the Company; the material facts underlying each transaction; the anticipated benefits
	to the Company and related costs associated with such benefits; whether comparable products or services were available; and the
	terms the Company could receive from an unrelated third party.


	 






	 



	60








	 




	 


	We intend to establish
	formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional Directors, so that
	such transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee
	thereof. With regard to any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions
	in the following manner:


	 







	·




	Disclosing such transactions
	in reports where required;





	 







	·




	Disclosing in any and all
	filings with the SEC, where required;





	 







	·




	Obtaining disinterested
	directors consent; and





	 







	·




	Obtaining shareholder consent
	where required.





	 



	Director Independence



	 


	Quotations for the Company’s
	common stock are entered on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board inter-dealer quotation system, which does not have director independence
	requirements. For purposes of determining director independence, the Company applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15).
	Under NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15), a director is not considered to be independent if he or she is also an executive officer or employee
	of the corporation. As a result, the Company does not have any independent directors. Our director, Gerald Brock, is also an executive
	officer of the Company.



	  







	LEGAL MATTERS



	 


	Cassidy & Associates,
	Beverly Hills, California (“Cassidy & Associates”), has given its opinion as attorneys-at-law regarding the validity
	of the issuance of the Shares offered by the Company. James Cassidy, a member of the law firm of Cassidy & Associates, is
	an officer and director of Tiber Creek Corporation and may be considered the beneficial owner of 125,000 shares of common stock
	of the Company owned by Tiber Creek Corporation.


	 



	Interest of Counsel



	 


	Cassidy & Associates,
	counsel for the Company, who has given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered and upon other legal matters
	in connection with the registration or offering of such securities, had, or is to receive in connection with the offering, a substantial

	EXPERTS




	 



	Anton & Chia LLC,
	an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the balance sheet of SkyWolf Wind Turbine Corporation as of December
	31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity
	(deficit), and cash flows for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.


	 


	The Company has included
	such financial statements in the prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement in reliance on the report of May 15, 2017,
	given their authority as experts in accounting and auditing.



	 






	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION




	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	The Company’s certificate
	of incorporation includes an indemnification provision that provides that the Company shall indemnify directors against monetary
	damages to the Company or any of its shareholders or others by reason of a breach of the director’s fiduciary duty or otherwise,
	except under certain limited circumstances.


	 






	 



	61








	 




	 


	The certificate of incorporation
	does not specifically indemnify the officers or directors or controlling persons against liability under the Securities Act. However,
	the indemnification provided in the certificate of incorporation is broad and should be considered to be of a broad scope and
	wide extent.


	 


	The Securities and Exchange
	Commission’s position on indemnification of officers, directors and control persons under the Securities Act by the Company
	is as follows:


	 



	INSOFAR AS INDEMNIFICATION FOR LIABILITIES
	ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 MAY BE PERMITTED TO DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CONTROLLING PERSONS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS
	ISSUER PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE COMMISSION, OR OTHERWISE, THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER HAS BEEN ADVISED THAT IN THE OPINION OF
	THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AS EXPRESSED IN THE ACT AND IS, THEREFORE,
	UNENFORCEABLE.

	SKYWOLF WIND TURBINE CORP.






	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016





	 






	Note 1 – Description of Business:




	 


	Skywolf Wind Turbine Corp. (“Skywolf”
	or “the Company”) designs, manufactures and sells mid-size ("small wind") wind turbines for electric power
	production, including wind-solar hybrid turbines. Its products are used in generating electricity to power homes and businesses,
	as well as charge batteries, and are sold through a network of distributors.


	 


	The Company was incorporated in New York State
	in 2010 and is located in Geneseo, New York. Its founder, Gerald E. Brock, serves as the sole director and president.


	 




	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies:




	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America ("GAAP").


	 



	Use of Estimates

	– The preparation
	of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash

	– For financial statement
	presentation purposes, the Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
	or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which at
	times may exceed federally-insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk as a result of
	any non-performance by the financial institution.


	 



	Inventory

	– Inventory consists
	of completed turbines and unassembled parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. The Company capitalizes applicable
	direct and indirect costs incurred in inventory production.


	 



	Property and Equipment

	– Property
	and equipment consists of software and equipment. Depreciation is recorded on accelerated methods over periods considered by management
	to be the assets' useful lives. Expenditures for repairs, minor items and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Any
	gain or loss upon sale or retirement due to obsolescence is recorded in operating results in the period it takes place. Software
	is being depreciated over three years and equipment is being depreciated over five years.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016



	 




	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies (Continued):




	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

	–
	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
	an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
	of an asset to future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, including its ultimate disposition. If such
	assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of
	an asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending
	on the nature of the asset.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments

	– The carrying value of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair
	value due to their short maturity. The carrying value of loans from the principal shareholder depends on the Company's ability
	to generate cash.


	 



	Revenue Recognition

	– Revenue
	is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (2) a service
	or product has been provided to a customer, (3) the sale price to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection
	of the sale price is reasonably assured. Amounts collected prior to satisfying these conditions are recorded as customer deposits.


	 



	Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

	– As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 there are no anticipated bad debts. Therefore, an allowance for doubtful accounts
	was not recorded.


	 



	Advertising Costs

	– Advertising
	costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs were $1,607 and $7,591 for the periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 



	Research and Development Costs

	–
	All costs of research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses
	for inventing and testing turbine prototypes, including the materials and other direct costs of constructing prototype turbines,
	as well as related equipment employed in research and development activity.


	 



	Income Taxes

	– The Company accounts
	for income taxes using the "asset and liability approach." That requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
	for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and
	liabilities. This method uses statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse
	and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred assets are recognized, net of any valuation
	allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense for a year
	is the net change in that year's deferred asset and liability balances.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016





	 






	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies (Continued):




	 


	The Company has a deferred tax asset for potential
	future tax savings of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. However, due to the uncertainty of future profits to
	absorb the carryforwards, an equal valuation allowance reduces the value of the deferred tax asset to zero.


	 



	Deferred Revenue – Customer Deposits

	– The Company has received $40,000 in deposits for sales orders that are in process.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Loss per Share

	–
	Basic earnings or loss per share reflect the weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
	per share are computed including the additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares (option or
	warrant shares, for example) were issued. No dilutive potential shares exist.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements

	– In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated No. 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)
	Restricted Cash” (“ASU 2016-18”). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or
	clarifying guidance on classification are presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18
	is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 1, 20117. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in
	this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
	ASU 2016-18, which will only impact the Company if it has restricted cash in the future.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
	“statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments: (“ASU 2016-15”).
	ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
	of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption
	on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively
	as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its condensed
	financial statements.


	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
	Ability to Continue as a Going Concern:. This standard is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether
	there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
	disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue
	to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred
	to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because
	it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance
	about management responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization’s ability to continue
	as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization’s management,
	with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing are content of disclosures that are commonly
	provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual period ending after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted
	for annual interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company is currently
	evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.

	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies (Continued):






	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASU 606,
	ASU 606 provides guidance outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts
	with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance requires us to recognize revenue when
	we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
	be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The original effective date of the guidance would have required us to adopt
	at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2017; however, the FASB approved an optional one-year deferral of the effective
	date. Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance
	obligations to customers and significant judgements in measurements and recognition. The new guidance may be applied retrospectively
	to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption.


	 


	In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
	Leases (Topic 842). The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from
	leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
	periods within those fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted.
	The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements.


	 


	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
	by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are
	not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.

	Note 3 – Going Concern:




	 


	The financial statements were prepared
	assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses over its entire history. These losses
	raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue operating. Survival of the Company depends on obtaining additional
	financing and achieving profitable operations. There is no assurance that the Company will raise sufficient capital or achieve
	profitability.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
	FIRM



	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of
	Skywolf Wind Turbine Corporation


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of Skywolf Wind Turbine Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations,
	stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
	Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
	reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
	amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and
	the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended; in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company has not yet generated
	enough revenues from its operations to cover its operating expense and has incurred an accumulated deficit of $2,654,863 since
	inception. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
	Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial statements, which include continuing
	to obtain additional financing and achieving profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	SKYWOLF WIND TURBINE CORP.




	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016 and 2015





	 






	Note 1 – Description of Business:




	 


	Skywolf Wind Turbine Corp. (“Skywolf”
	or “the Company”) designs, manufactures and sells mid-size ("small wind") wind turbines for electric power
	production, including wind-solar hybrid turbines. Its products are used in generating electricity to power homes and businesses,
	as well as charge batteries, and are sold through a network of distributors.


	 


	The Company was incorporated in New York
	State in 2010 and is located in Geneseo, New York. Its founder, Gerald E. Brock, serves as the sole director and president.


	 




	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies:




	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").


	 



	Use of Estimates

	– The preparation
	of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash

	– For financial statement
	presentation purposes, the Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
	or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which at
	times may exceed federally-insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk as a result of
	any non-performance by the financial institution.


	 



	Inventory

	– Inventory consists
	of completed turbines and unassembled parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. The Company capitalizes applicable
	direct and indirect costs incurred in inventory production.


	 



	Property and Equipment

	– Property
	and equipment consists of software and equipment. Depreciation is recorded on accelerated methods over periods considered by management
	to be the assets' useful lives. Expenditures for repairs, minor items and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Any
	gain or loss upon sale or retirement due to obsolescence is recorded in operating results in the period it takes place. Software
	is being depreciated over three years and equipment is being depreciated over five years.

	SKYWOLF WIND TURBINE CORP.




	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016 and 2015



	 




	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies (Continued):




	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

	– Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
	of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
	of an asset to future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, including its ultimate disposition. If
	such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
	of an asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values,
	depending on the nature of the asset.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments

	– The carrying value of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their
	fair value due to their short maturity. The carrying value of loans from the principal shareholder depends on the Company's ability
	to generate cash.


	 



	Revenue Recognition

	– Revenue
	is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (2) a service
	or product has been provided to a customer, (3) the sale price to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection
	of the sale price is reasonably assured. Amounts collected prior to satisfying these conditions are recorded as customer deposits.


	 



	Allowance For Doubtful Accounts

	–
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 there are no anticipated bad debts so an allowance for doubtful accounts was not recorded.


	 



	Advertising Costs

	– Advertising
	costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs were $16,133 and $17,668 for the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
	are included in other general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations.


	 



	Research and Development Costs

	–
	All costs of research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses
	for inventing and testing turbine prototypes, including the materials and other direct costs of constructing prototype turbines,
	as well as related equipment employed in research and development activity.


	 



	Income Taxes

	– The Company
	accounts for income taxes using the "asset and liability approach." That requires recognition of deferred tax assets
	and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis
	of assets and liabilities. This method uses statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are
	expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred assets are recognized,
	net of any valuation allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income
	tax expense for a year is the net change in that year's deferred asset and liability balances.

	SKYWOLF WIND TURBINE CORP.




	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016 and 2015





	 






	Note 2 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies (Continued):




	 


	The Company has a deferred tax asset for
	potential future tax savings of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. However, due to the uncertainty of future
	profits to absorb the carryforwards, an equal valuation allowance reduces the value of the deferred tax asset to zero.


	 



	Deferred Revenue – Customer Deposits

	– The Company has received $40,000 in deposits for sales orders that are in process as of December 31, 2016.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Loss per Share

	– Basic earnings or loss per share reflect the weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted
	earnings per share are computed including the additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares
	(option or warrant shares, for example) were issued. No dilutive potential shares exist.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements

	- In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASU 606, ASU 606 provides guidance outlining a single comprehensive model for entities
	to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.
	This guidance requires us to recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
	the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The original effective date
	of the guidance would have required us to adopt at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2017; however, the FASB approved
	an optional one-year deferral of the effective date. Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue
	recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgements in measurements and recognition.
	The new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized
	as of the date of adoption.


	 




	Note 3 – Going Concern:




	 


	The financial statements were prepared assuming
	that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses over its entire history. These losses raise
	substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue operating. Survival of the Company depends on obtaining additional financing
	and achieving profitable operations. There is no assurance that the Company will raise sufficient capital or achieve profitability.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements do not
	include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	Note 6 – Shareholder Loan:




	 


	Unsecured loan balances on open account from
	the founder and major shareholder at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $446,000 and $176,000, respectively. Loan repayments, were
	$20,000 for 2016. Additional loans to the Company during 2016 were $290,000 for working capital. The loans are non-interest bearing
	and have no repayment terms.


	 




	Note 7 – Loan Payable:




	 


	On September 16, 2016 the Company obtained
	a $66,100 term loan payable from a financing company. The loan’s interest rate is 28.70% and will be paid on weekly installments
	of $820. The loan payback period is 24 months of which $30,831 is due within the next twelve months. The loan will be paid in full
	by September of 2018. The loan also includes a remaining loan premium of $14,694 which represents interest that is
	due on the loan and must be paid in full. Interest expense for the years ended 2016 and 2015 amounted to $4,476 and $0, respectively,
	which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations.

	The Company has $2,390,660 in tax return net
	operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), including an $1,610 contribution carryover, available to reduce future taxable income. These
	NOLs expire between 2032 and 2035. Additional deferred tax NOL benefits relate to timing differences for depreciation of fixed
	assets. Due to uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the NOLs
	before they expire, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to offset the entire deferred tax asset.

	Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.



	 


	The Company has issued
	the following securities in the last three (3) years. All such securities were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration
	of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering, as noted below. Each
	of these transactions was issued as part of a private placement of securities by the Company in which (i) no general advertising
	or solicitation was used, and (ii) the investors purchasing securities were acquiring the same for investment purposes only, without
	a view to resale. Furthermore, no underwriters participated or effectuated any of the transactions specified below. Also, no underwriting
	discounts or commissions applied to any of the transactions set forth below. All potential investors were contacted personally
	and possessed at the time of their investment bona fide substantive, pre-existing business relationships with the Company and/or
	its officers, directors and affiliates. No potential investors were contacted through other means, and no general advertising or
	general solicitation was used to solicit any investors.


	 


	In 2014 the Company
	issued 4,960,350 shares of common stock to 67 shareholders and received $468,800 in proceeds. These shares were issued in reliance
	upon the exemption from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.


	 



	In
	2015, the Company issued 6,098,650 shares of common stock to 110 shareholders and received $530,750 in proceeds.


	These
	shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) of the
	Securities Act.



	 



	In
	May 2017, the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock, valued at $25,000, to two shareholders pursuant to an agreement with
	Tiber Creek Corporation.


	These shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration
	under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.



	 


	In 2017, the Company
	issued 3,335,250 shares of common stock to 57 shareholders and received $294,250 in proceeds. These shares were issued in reliance
	upon the exemption from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

	Exemption From Registration. The shares
	of Common Stock referenced herein were issued in reliance upon one of the following exemptions:



	 



	(a) The shares of Common
	Stock referenced herein were issued in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration afforded by the provisions of Section
	4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, ("Securities Act"), based upon the following: (a) each of the persons
	to whom the shares of Common Stock were issued (each such person, an "Investor") confirmed to the Company that it or
	he is a sophisticated investor and has such background, education and experience in financial and business matters as to be able
	to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the securities, (b) there was no public offering or general solicitation with
	respect to the offering of such shares, (c) each Investor was provided with certain disclosure materials and all other information
	requested with respect to the Company, (d) each Investor acknowledged that all securities being purchased were being purchased
	for investment intent and were "restricted securities" for purposes of the Securities Act, and agreed to transfer such
	securities only in a transaction registered under the Securities Act or exempt from registration under the Securities Act and (e)
	a legend has been, or will be, placed on the certificates representing each such security stating that it was restricted and could
	only be transferred if subsequently registered under the Securities Act or transferred in a transaction exempt from registration
	under the Securities Act.



	 



	(b)

	 

	The
	shares of Common Stock referenced herein were issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Act.
	No commissions were paid in connection with the completion of this offering, except as noted above. We completed the offering of
	the shares pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Act on the basis that the sale of the shares was completed in an "offshore
	transaction", as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S. We did not engage in any directed selling efforts, as defined in
	Regulation S, in the United States in connection with the sale of the shares. Each investor represented to us that the investor
	was not a "U.S. person", as defined in Regulation S, and was not acquiring the shares for the account or benefit of a
	U.S. person. The agreement executed between us and each investor included statements that the securities had not been registered
	pursuant to the Act and that the securities may not be offered or sold in the United States unless the securities are registered
	under the Act or pursuant to an exemption from the Act. Each investor agreed by execution of the agreement for the shares: (i)
	to resell the securities purchased only in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the Act
	or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Act; (ii) that we are required to refuse to register any sale of the securities
	purchased unless the transfer is in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the Act or pursuant
	to an exemption from registration under the Act; and (iii) not to engage in hedging transactions with regards to the securities
	purchased unless in compliance with the Act. All certificates representing the shares were or upon issuance will be endorsed with
	a restrictive legend confirming that the securities had been issued pursuant to Regulation S of the Act and could not be resold
	without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.




	 




	(c) The shares of common
	stock referenced herein were issued pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation D Rule 506 and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
	Act. We made this determination in part based on the representations of Investors, which included, in pertinent part, that such
	Investors were an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, and upon such further representations
	from the Investors that (a) the Investor is acquiring the securities for his, her or its own account for investment and not for
	the account of any other person and not with a view to or for distribution, assignment or resale in connection with any distribution
	within the meaning of the Securities Act, (b) the Investor agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer the purchased securities unless
	they are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or an exemption or exemptions from such
	registration are available, (c) the Investor either alone or together with its representatives has knowledge and experience in
	financial and business matters such that he, she or it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in us, and
	(d) the Investor has no need for the liquidity in its investment in us and could afford the complete loss of such investment.  Our
	determination is made based further upon our action of (a) making written disclosure to each Investor prior to the closing of sale
	that the securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and therefore cannot be resold unless they are registered
	or unless an exemption from registration is available, (b) making written descriptions of the securities being offered, the use
	of the proceeds from the offering and any material changes in the Company’s affairs that are not disclosed in the documents
	furnished, and (c) placement of a legend on the certificate that evidences the securities stating that the securities have not
	been registered under the Securities Act and setting forth the restrictions on transferability and sale of the securities, and
	upon such inaction of  the Company of any general solicitation or advertising for securities herein issued in reliance
	upon Regulation D Rule 506 and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

	(d) The shares of
	common stock referenced herein were issued pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation D Rule 504 and Section 4(a)(2) of the
	Securities Act. We made this determination in part based on the fact that, at the time of each sale of stock, the Company was
	not a blank check company, did not have to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and sales of our stock under
	this exemption did not exceed $1,000,000 of our securities in any 12-month period. Our determination is made based further upon
	our action of (a) making written disclosure to each Investor prior to the closing of sale that the securities have not been registered
	under the Securities Act and therefore cannot be resold unless they are registered or unless an exemption from registration is
	available, (b) making written descriptions of the securities being offered, the use of the proceeds from the offering and any
	material changes in the Company’s affairs that are not disclosed in the documents furnished, and (c) placement of a legend
	on the certificate that evidences the securities stating that the securities have not been registered under the Securities Act
	and setting forth the restrictions on transferability and sale of the securities, and upon such inaction of the Company of any
	general solicitation or advertising for securities herein issued in reliance upon Regulation D Rule 504 and Section 4(a)(2) of
	the Securities Act.

	Item 17. Undertakings.



	 


	Undertaking Required by Item 512 of Regulation
	S-K.


	 


	(a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	(1) to file, during any period
	in which it offers or sells securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement to:


	 


	(i) include any
	prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;


	 


	(ii) reflect in the prospectus
	any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment
	thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration
	statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of
	securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum
	offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate,
	the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation
	of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and


	 


	(iii) include any material
	information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change
	to such information in the registration statement; provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this rule do
	not apply if the registration statement is on Form S-8, and the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment
	by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13
	or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement; and paragraphs (a)(1)(i),
	(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the registration statement is on Form S-3 or Form F-3 and the information
	required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the
	Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in
	the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is not part of the registration
	statement.


	 






	 



	67








	 




	  


	Provided further, however, that paragraphs
	(a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) do not apply if the registration statement is for an offering of asset-backed securities on Form S-1 or
	Form S-3, and the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment is provided pursuant to item 1100(c) of Regulation
	AB.


	 


	(2) For determining liability
	under the Securities Act, treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the
	offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering.


	 


	(3) File a post-effective
	amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering.


	 


	(b) For determining liability of the registrant
	under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the registrant undertakes that in a primary
	offering of securities of the registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to
	sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following
	communications, the registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such
	purchaser:


	 


	(1) Any preliminary prospectus
	or prospectus of the registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(2) Any free writing prospectus
	relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the registrant or used or referred to by the registrant;


	 


	(3) The portion of any other
	free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the registrant or its securities provided
	by or on behalf of the registrant; and


	 


	(4) Any other communication
	that is an offer in the offering made by the registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	(c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to
	the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
	person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	 


	(d) That, for the purpose of determining liability
	under the Securities Act to any purchaser:


	 


	If the registrant
	is relying on Rule 430B:


	 


	(i) Each prospectus filed
	by the registrant pursuant to 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus
	was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and


	 






	 



	68








	 






	 


	(ii) Each prospectus required
	to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating
	to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section
	10(a) of the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date
	such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering
	described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date
	an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in
	the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to
	be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus
	that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration
	statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior
	to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part
	of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or


	 


	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C,
	each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration
	statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
	in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
	a registration statement or prospectus that is part of a registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated
	by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with
	a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement
	or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first
	use.


	 


	If the registrant is relying on Rule 430A:


	 


	(i) For purposes of determining
	any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration
	statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or
	(4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared
	effective.


	 


	(ii) For the purpose of determining
	any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be
	a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
	be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
