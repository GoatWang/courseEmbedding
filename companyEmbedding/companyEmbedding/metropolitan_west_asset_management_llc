2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

History[edit]
Founded by Robert Addison Day in 1971 and headquartered in Los Angeles, TCW manages a broad range of investment products.[1] The TCW Group was originally known as Trust Company of the West. TCW clients include many of the largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations in the U.S., as well as foreign investors and high-net-worth individuals.[2]
In 2001, Société Générale (SocGen) acquired a controlling interest in The TCW Group.[3][4]
On February 24, 2010, TCW announced the completion of its acquisition of Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC (MetWest), a leading fixed income investment management firm.[5]
In February 2013, TCW management and alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group acquired TCW Group from Société Générale.[6] As a result of the transaction, TCW management and employees increased their ownership in the firm to approximately 40% on a fully diluted basis, better aligning interests with clients. Equity for the investment came from two Carlyle investment funds and from TCW management.[7]
As of March 31, 2017, TCW had $194.3 billion of assets under management or committed to management.[8] The CEO of The TCW Group is David Lippman.[9]
