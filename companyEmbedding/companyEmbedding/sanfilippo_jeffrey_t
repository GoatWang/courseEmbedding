Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Operating Results Conference Call. At this time all participants in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Mike Valentine, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Valentine
Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2017 third quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today is Jeffrey Sanfilippo, our CEO; Jasper Sanfilippo, our COO; and Howard Brandeisky, our Senior Vice President of Global Marketing.
Before we start, we may make some forward-looking statements today. These statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business. The factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various SEC filings that we made, including Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties.
Starting with the income statement. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased by 19.6% to $173.4 million compared to net sales of 215.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales was attributable to a 10.8% decrease in sales volume and a 9.9% decline in the weighted average selling price per pound. The decline in the weighted average selling price per pound primarily resulted from lower selling prices for almonds.
Sales volume decreased for all major product types and in all distribution channels as well. The decrease in the consumer channel sales volume was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of cashews and mixed nuts with private brand customers. Sales volume also declined for our branded products in the quarterly comparison as follows: sales volume for Fisher recipe nuts fell by 3.2%, primarily due to inventory reduction initiatives implemented by some customers during the third quarter; Fisher snack nut sales volume decreased by 9.4% due to lower merchandising activity; sales volume for Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country produce brands decreased by 5.5% due to a decline in sales for our Sunshine Country produce brand, which resulted from lost distribution.
The Sunshine Country sales volume decline was partially offset by a 4.6% increase in sales volume for Orchard Valley Harvest produce brand due to increased merchandising activity. The decrease in sales volume in the contract packaging channel was attributable to a reduction in merchandising activity implemented by a customer in that channel. The sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel resulted mainly from lost business with a bulk almond butter customer, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Net sales for the first three quarters of the current year decreased to $645.0 million from 720.5 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. The decline in net sales in the year-to-date comparison was primarily attributable to an 8.8% reduction in the weighted average selling price per pound which primarily occurred as a result of lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts. Additionally, the decline in net sales was also attributable to a 1.9% decrease in sales volume, which was driven by lower sales volume for almonds and mixed nuts. 

The volume decline for those nuts was partially offset by sales volume increases for peanuts, snack and trail mixes and walnuts. Sales volume increased in the consumer and contract packaging channels and declined in the commercial ingredients channel. The sales volume increase in the consumer channel came mainly from increased sales of Fisher recipe nuts, Orchard Valley Harvest produce products and private brand snack nuts. 
The sales volume increase in the contract packaging channel resulted primarily from increased sales of snack and trail mixes, peanuts, cashews and almonds to our existing customers. The sales volume decrease in the commercial ingredients channel was driven by the loss of the almond -- bulk almond butter customer that we mentioned before and also lower sales of bulk inshell walnuts to international customers and lower sales of peanuts to other peanut shellers. 
Third quarter gross profit increased by 11.1% and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.4%, up from 11.9% for the third quarter of last year. The increases in both gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily related to lower acquisition costs for almonds and improved alignment of selling prices and acquisition costs for pecans and walnuts. Gross profit for the first three quarters of the current year increased by 4.3% and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.8% from 14.4% for the first three quarters of last year. 
The increases in gross profit and gross profit margin primarily occurred for the same reasons I cited in the quarterly comparison. Total operating expenses for the current third quarter decreased by $2.1 million and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter increased to 10.4% from 9.3% for the third quarter of last year. 
Total operating expenses for the current year-to-date period decreased by $3.3 million and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 9.5% from 9% for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. The decreases in total operating expenses in both comparisons were due to lower advertising expense due to later Easter holiday and reductions in compensation and broker commission expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in shipping expense. 
The increases in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for bulk comparisons were due to a lower net sales base. Interest expense for the current third quarter was $900,000, which was consistent with the interest expense for the third quarter of last year. 
Interest expense for the first three quarters of the current year decreased to $2.1 million from $2.6 million for the first three quarters of last year. The decrease in interest expense in the year to date comparison primarily resulted from lower debt levels during the first half of the current fiscal year. 
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $6.3 million or $0.55 per share diluted compared to net income of $3.1 million or $0.27 per share diluted for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Net income for the first three quarters of fiscal ‘17 was $29.4 million or $2.58 per share diluted, compared to net income of $23.1 million or $2.04 per share diluted, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. Taking a quick look at inventory. Total value of inventory on hand at the end of the current third quarter decreased by $5.9 million or 2.9% compared to the total inventory value on hand at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in the total value of inventory on hand was primarily driven by lower quantities of finished goods combined with a lower weighted average cost per pound for finished goods. Higher acquisition costs for pecans, which were largely offset by lower acquisition costs for almonds, led to a 1.4% increase in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand in the quarterly comparison. Finally, I would like to take a moment to alert investors that we will be presenting at the East Coast IDEAS Investor Conference on Wednesday, May 17, at the Boston Park Plaza in Boston. Our presentation is scheduled to begin at 11:20 a.m. Eastern Time and the presentation will be webcast live and may be accessed at the conference website, www.ideasconference.com. And now, Jeffrey Sanfilippo, our CEO, will provide additional comments on our performance in the current quarter. Jeffrey?

Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Following the fifth consecutive year of record second quarter results for net income and diluted earnings per share, the company’s third quarter results for net income and EPS were also very strong. Net income of $6.3 million and earnings per share of $0.55 in this quarter were the second-highest Q3 results in the company’s history, significant performance in spite of the headwinds we faced with volume top line revenue. As discussed on previous calls, commodity prices, commodity price decreases and the loss of a bulk almond butter customer in our commercial ingredients channel had an unfavorable impact on net sales during this quarter. 
In addition, we faced decreases in merchandising activity in the consumer and contract manufacturing channels that negatively impacted branded, private brand and contract manufacturing volumes. To offset the negative impact on net income from this sales decline, we recognized that we would have to increase gross profit margin, capture savings in our selling and admin expenses and focus on growing sales volume. Since last year’s third quarter, we made significant improvements in managing our walnut inventory aligning our selling prices and acquisition costs and leveraging our procurement expertise to drive the considerable increase in our gross profit margin that occurred in the quarterly comparison. 
We’re also successful in reducing selling and administrative expenses and we accomplished a great deal with continuous improvement projects, fixated at quality, operating efficiencies and manufacturing costs. While sales volume was generally down for our brands at retail, our Fisher recipe nuts and Orchard Valley Harvest brands outperformed in their respective categories in quarterly comparison according to IRI market data. Our success is due to the entire team effort across the organization. These results would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our management team and every one of our employees and I thank each of them for their hard work, leadership and support.
Turning to sales review by business channel. Net sales in the consumer channel decreased by 14.8% in dollars and sales volume decreased 6.1% in the third quarter of fiscal ‘17. The sales volume decrease, as Mike mentioned, was driven by lower volume of cashews and mixed nuts with private brand customers and decreased sales of our branded products. We saw changes in private brand strategies with some of our key customers, which had a negative impact on volume in the third quarter. In addition, decreases in merchandising and promotions across both private brand and branded segments in the snack segments negatively impacted volume.
Net sales in the commercial ingredient distribution channel decreased by 38.9% in dollars and 26.3% in sales volume in the third quarter, mainly from lost distribution from that bulk almond butter customer, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal ‘17. Our efforts to share resources from industrial segment to pursue more profitable business segments are beginning to pay off. We’re seeing strong results in food service as we complete the major customer, product and brand repositioning work executed over the last few years, essentially streamlining who we sell to and what we sell them, while driving increased branded product distribution. These efforts have driven solid double-digit growth on Fisher and Orchard Valley Harvest branded products in the food service channel.
Further, the overall customer and product mix shift is driving margin improvements. We have specific initiatives to continue growth of the food service channel with efforts against all three of our strategic pillars: first, grow JBSS Brands; efforts centered around Fisher value-added products for menu applications; and [indiscernible] flavor, variety and quality that consumers demand. In addition, these products relieve kitchen labor cost pressure of restaurant operators and help with food consistency. Second, expand consumer reach. We are focused on distribution and placement of Orchard Valley Harvest snack items. This is being executed by adding specific resources that have had success in this area and by performing partnerships with companies that service these locations. And third, create value with key customers. The opportunity to expand with national chain restaurants and strong regional players by adding appropriate culinary resources and developing customized solutions. In particular, help these customers grow through customized net based menu solutions, driving traffic and increase check average. We are just starting that work now. And while these types of initiatives tend to have longer payback cycles, we’re looking for solid results in the coming year.

Net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by 6.1% in dollars and 3.9% in sales volume in the third quarter, sales volume decrease for the quarterly period was primarily due to reduction in merchandising attributes I mentioned earlier.
Turning now to category updates. Market information I’ll be referring to is IRI-reported data and for today, it is for the 12 week period ending March 19, 2017. When I refer to Q3, I’m also referring to the 12 week period ending March 19. References to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago. We look at the category on IRI is totally U.S. definition, which includes food, drug, mass, Walmart, military and other outlets unless otherwise specified. And when we discuss pricing, we are referring to average price per pound.
Breakouts of the recipe, snack and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with IRI. And the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution. First, let me review category dynamics. The total nut category was flat in pound volume and declined in dollar sales by 1% in Q3. Overall, prices at this macro level declined 1% versus a year ago.
Now let’s look at each category a little more in depth, starting with recipe nuts. In Q3, the recipe nut category continued to struggle, declining 12% in dollar sales and 7% in pound sales. Walnut pound sales were up 2% driven by a 16% decline in weighted average walnut prices versus prior year. But the walnut sales pound increase was offset by pecans and almonds. Pecan pound sales declined 11%, driven by an 8% increase in average prices versus the prior year. And almond pound sales declined 15% despite a 7% decrease in average prices. Consumers continue to migrate to the snack or produce section of the store for almonds as almond pound consumption in both sections increased versus last year. Despite those category headwinds, our Fisher brand had a positive quarter and continues to gain momentum behind our integrated marketing efforts. Fisher recipe nuts increased 3% in pound sales and was flat in dollar sales in the quarter versus last year. As a result, Fisher pound share in the category increased 2.4 points versus last year. Fisher recipe is a leading branded recipe nut with an overall share of 24.6%, which is 9.9 share points ahead of our nearest branded and competitor. The growth was driven by an increase in distribution and velocity.
Distribution, measured as ACV, increased 7 percentage points versus last year as our sales team continues to translate our retail success into greater retail penetration. Distribution for Fisher recipe nuts is now at 56% ACV, with room to continue to grow. In addition to the distribution gains, pound velocity increased 3%. The velocity growth was driven by strong merchandising performance at new and existing customers and the effectiveness of our brand, no preservatives and non-GMO messaging. Our continued brand equity efforts on Fisher, coupled with our distribution gains helped the brand overcome category weakness and deliver growth in the third quarter.
Now let me turn to the snack category. In Q3, the snack category decreased 4% in dollars and 3% in pound sales versus last year. And weighted average prices decreased 2%, driven by declines in almonds of 10% and peanut declines of 2%. Fisher snack decreased 13% in sales dollars and 3% in pound sales as measured by IRI. This was driven by a decrease of 4% in total points of distribution and a reduction of merchandising activity by 9% versus last year. We are working on repositioning our Fisher snack program to overcome this poor performance. Our 
Orchard Valley Harvest brand had a strong third quarter increasing 44% in dollar sales and 55% pound sales. Orchard Valley Harvest grew faster than the category, which was up roughly 12% in pounds resulting in 2 cents of a point increase in pound share. Our velocity increased 32% behind strong merchandising efforts and our average item per store selling increased 16% versus last year. We have upsized the consumer by migrating them to our multipacks, which now comprise 91% of the dollar sales of the portfolio. And velocity on the multipacks is 3 times that of our minis.

We continue to build the core business success by launching new products such as Omega 3 mix and dark chocolate covered fruits, both in multipacks. Sunshine Country, our other brand in the produce section of the store, did not perform as well as Orchard Valley Harvest. The brand declined 20% in dollar sales and 16% in pound sales. The brand declined due to lost distribution at a key customer versus the prior year. Our total produce business, Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country, grew 18% in pounds in the third quarter compared to a year ago.
In closing, we face a number of challenges in the future such as volatile commodity markets for certain nuts, especially pecans and cashews. Conversely, we have seen acquisition costs for tree nuts such as almonds decrease in the 2016 crop year. There are headwinds and tailwinds going into the remaining quarter of fiscal ‘18 and into fiscal 2018 and the management team remains focused on consistent execution of our corporate goals to create customer and shareholder value. We appreciate your participation in the call and thank you for your interest in our company. 
I’ll now turn the call back over to Mike.
Mike Valentine
Thank you, Jeff. We will now open the call to questions. Chuck, please queue up the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Francesco Pellegrino with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.
Francesco Pellegrino
So this was a pretty nice quarter despite a lot of components to your top line that didn’t really go your way. And I guess, just before I dig a little bit deeper, pecan cost year over year, were they up, down or flat?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Was it pecan cost? I’m sorry, I didn’t hear. Yes, it’s a little up this year versus last year significantly.
Francesco Pellegrino
So your pecan costs were up because I noticed that sales by product type, the only product type that increased was pecan. I know you’re vertically integrated for pecans, walnuts and peanuts. So when I just think about the top line struggles, I’m thinking that a lot of this margin expansion you got was probably from your cost structure. And when I think about your cost structure, I think about seller margin and then I also think about your procurement expertise. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color in regards to how your sheller margins performed as compared to maybe some favorable impact you got from maybe some opportunistic buying for cashews and almonds as compared to the year ago period?
Mike Valentine
I can take that, Francesco. In respect to sheller margins, we’d like to talk about that in respect to the entire shelling industry. So with market increases that we’ve seen with pecans this year, we believe that margins for pecan shellers have expanded this year compared to last year.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. And I guess maybe with some other nuts that you’re not vertically integrated for cashews and almonds. If -- when you talk about overall sheller industry margin is expanding, then I would think that you would be hurt by greater margins for almond shellers and cashew shellers. It just seems as if something on your cost structure contributed to have really the impressive quarter? And I’m just trying to dig a little bit deeper to see if it would -- the nuts that you’re vertically integrated for or maybe it was opportunistic buying for others, and I’m not sure if you could give a little bit of color or if you can’t for competitive reasons?
Mike Valentine
Again -- I’ll start with sheller margins and I’ll talk about each -- entire industry. So it’s my belief that with the recent rise in peanut market prices, I believe that peanut sheller margins have expanded this year compared to last year. We also have seen a recent increase in walnut market prices, and I believe the same case could be made for walnut sheller margins. So obviously, when the entire industry sheller margins expand, typically, we would expand with them and of course same goes in the other direction. As you mentioned before, we don’t shell almonds and cashews, so a contraction of sheller margins for those particular nuts typically would benefit us.

Jeffrey Sanfilippo
We’ve got such good visibility from our procurement team just being in the industry so long. I think we did a great job at acquiring inventories and managing our positions very well and we do a great job aligning our costs with our selling prices. So a lot of times we are the first to market with price changes just because of our visibility and understanding of market dynamics and consumption, which helps us.
Francesco Pellegrino
It’s interesting you say that because in the year-ago period, you guys actually got burnt on the plummet in walnut prices. And I guess really just what I’m getting at is, when I look at your investor deck, and I look at that slide that has peanut and tree nuts spot market prices versus your rolling 4 quarter gross margins, I see a plummet in almond prices and then I see a quick rebound. And I’m just wondering if you guys really lucked out by some strong opportunistic buying maybe for almonds if I try to maybe narrow in a little bit more on my questioning in regards to what contributed to this strong quarter? Did almond gross profit per pound increase for you guys in this quarter as compared to the year-ago period?
Mike Valentine
Sure, I’ll take that, Francesco, as I’m ultimately responsible for buying almonds. We did have a significant improvement in profitability on almonds this year compared to last year. We did, we have a lot of expertise in that area and have to give our almond buyer a lot of credit for timing his purchases at the right time.
Francesco Pellegrino
Was it luck or, when you think about is the personnel and the skill set, I don’t know if you would call it something like tree nut alpha or something. How would you put the competency level of these guys against the rest of the industry because it almost seems as if there might be a competitive advantage?
Mike Valentine
Well, we’ve always touted the fact that we have probably the most experienced nut procurement team in the industry, people with decades of experience. And in many cases that experience helps you beat the market, and this year, I think, that was the case, especially for almonds.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
And then let me also add, we’ve talked about this on many calls, we have focused on growing a more profitable business, more value-added business with customers that are looking for something differentiated. So that helps and also operations team has done a great job driving cost [indiscernible] profitability as well. It’s really a combination of procurement, expertise and other things we’re doing in the company.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. As I said before, a lot of your revenue drivers during the quarter weren’t that impressive and you just think if, maybe you did have one of those revenue drivers be a little bit stronger, how much more impressive of a quarter this could be? My question for you is, the third quarter of this year, so we have this significant decline in total volume sales whether you want to look at the branded category or the private label category. And I’m wondering if it’s more of a timing issue and maybe we could see a nice rebound in volume sales in the fourth quarter despite the fact that we are going to be lapping the lost almond butter business, I mean, maybe given insight into where retailer inventory levels are, or just maybe what’s happening with private label, could that be rebounding going into the fourth quarter? Just a little bit of commentary would be helpful with that.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Sure. Let’s take a couple of things. One is, we have no control over some of our private brand customers in the way they merchandise and the way they set their shelves. We saw some adjustments they made in Q2 that impacted Q3. We have since then seen some readjustments. So we would expect some of that volume declines to turn around going forward. And then as far as merchandising and promotion activity, we’re optimistic of volume growth going forward.

Francesco Pellegrino
I was operating under the assumption that some of the product placement issues at some of these retailers for private label nuts was more of a 2016 issue and that we were going to be favorably lapping that right now, but it seems as if some of these situations are getting worse?
Mike Valentine
Almost sounds like...
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Yes, I don’t want to say it’s getting worse. There is some inventory loading by some retailers in Q2. So up through December, we’re seeing some of that cycle through volume that’s impacted Q3 volume, some promotions and some information [indiscernible] that’s starting to move through that inventory now.
Francesco Pellegrino
So the product placement last year which was bad is even worse this year, which I would think would set up for an easy [indiscernible] if can just get their act together?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
I think it’s a good comment.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. And if the opportunity for greater volume sales persists into the fourth quarter exists, then, your finished goods inventory looks a little bit light as compared to the year-ago period. So would you think that maybe you’re not positioned necessarily well for a strong fourth quarter volume uptick?
Mike Valentine
We’ll let Jasper address that. Go ahead, Jasper.
Jasper Sanfilippo
I would say that our inventory position reflects what we look in our forecast, and I think it reflects certainly the demand that we’re foreseeing. The position’s typically because of new [indiscernible] requirements, we are having to take shorter positions with respect to on-time deliveries and we’re taking more deliveries from our suppliers quicker. So we have better inventory turns due to freshness in additional processing that we have to do on our nuts.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stefan Mykytiuk with ACK. Your line is open, go ahead please.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Just sorry to be redundant, but Jeffrey you were breaking up on some of those answers. I didn’t hear what you were saying in terms of the -- just the volume rebound. I guess, when I look at Q4, we’ve got another quarter of the almond butter contract rolling off and then last year you had the extra week. So I guess, as we look to Q4, is it logical to think that we have a similar volume decline in Q4 that we did in Q3, and then in the fall we start to get some of that back?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
With the extra week, obviously, that’s something that we can’t make up from a timing standpoint, but we got new business that we’ll be shipping in Q4. We’ve seen changes that impacted Q2 and Q3 from retail or private brand decisions that we had no control over, we’re tending to see readjustments. They’ve seen the same volume challenges that we’ve experienced from a manufacturing side. So we anticipate some of that volume to shift, so we wouldn’t see that declining trend, but at least stability in that items that [indiscernible].
Stefan Mykytiuk
Okay. Sorry, you broke up again in the end. So you’re saying that kind of incremental decline we saw in Q3 we get back in Q4 you think from some of the new business or private label coming back?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Correct.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Got you. But we still have the almond butter and then the extra week that we got to compare against.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Cycle through. Yes. Exactly.
Stefan Mykytiuk
And then the overall price decline was -- had been coming down the last couple -- was down 10% in Q1 and then 7% in Q2, and I would have thought that we would have seen like further mitigation in Q3. What was it that all of the sudden turned in Q3 and caused further average price decline?
Mike Valentine
I can take that Jeff. There was a further decline in almond prices from Q2, and I think that, that kind of bumped it back up.
Stefan Mykytiuk

Got it. So in Q4 now with pecan prices going up and peanut prices going up, does the average price decline mitigate at all in Q4 or [indiscernible]?
Mike Valentine
Well, I think, we started to get into lower almond prices in last year’s Q4. So that large change that we saw in Q3 over Q3 is going to come down quite a bit. Everything else should be pretty comparable with the last year and then, of course, we’re going to see increasing cashew prices just as we did a bit in this last quarterly comparison. So I don’t think that change in weighted average selling price is going to have as much of an impact on our top line as it did in this current third quarter.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Got it. Okay. And then just one other thing Jeffrey, you had mentioned kind of headwinds and tailwinds going into next year. Can you just elaborate a little bit more. We’ve probably touched on a few of them here, but I’m just curious what are the other kind of tailwinds and headwinds as you look forward?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
As for tailwinds, we do have some little bit over the last 6 months. So that we’ll start shipping in Q4 as we see some positive impact on volume growth and with those new customers I think our sales and marketing team are doing a great job expanding distribution with our Fisher recipe and Orchard Valley Harvest brands as we expect some tailwinds going into fiscal ‘18 with new distribution and new customers there. The headwinds, again, we’ve got the short week for Q4, and then just some of the volatility in cashew prices, as Mike mentioned, we’ll see some severe increases coming down the pike in the very near future from commodity standpoint. But from a gross standpoint and volume, we’re laser-focused on that. We realized we’ve got some more work to do, but we’re optimistic on what we’ve got in place right now going forward.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mitch Pinheiro with Wunderlich Securities. Your line is open. Go ahead please.
Mitch Pinheiro
I was trying to figure out, you said total nut, when Jeffrey, when you were giving the IRI data, total nut volume was flat in the period. That was the category correct?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Correct. Yes, top line.
Mitch Pinheiro
Can you talk about the category in general, maybe -- first of all, you are seeing ecommerce, Amazon and the like, are they taking any share out of your conventional channels? And do you participate in these channels at all?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
And so we do see -- it’s hard to measure exactly what’s shifting from typical bricks and mortar retail to ecommerce, but we do believe and have seen some shipments in consumer consumption that are shifting to ecommerce. We are focused on ecommerce channel as part of our expanding consumer reach and our alternative strategic growth initiative. So we are looking at ecommerce and working with several players now in that channel. And we do anticipate in the future more consumption being done online.
Mitch Pinheiro
Is there -- and anything else with the category itself, I mean, nuts haven’t lost their healthy luster. Is there something -- for flat volume, is there anything else happening that you could call out?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Howard, you want to say anything specific, since you’ve got little good perspective on general dynamics or consumption dynamics?
Howard Brandeisky
All we see is snack nut category was down about 3%. We already talked a little bit about the recipe nut category was down 7%. The produce -- as we measure it, the produce part of the store actually grew the most, had the strongest performance in our third quarter and that was driven by the drop in prices that we’ve seen in pistachio. And so we saw a big surge in pistachio volume and in the category that is. And so that resulted in the overall flat sales for the category.

Mike Valentine
Howard, can you also talk a little bit about the recipe nut category that was down about 7% in quarterly comparison.
Howard Brandeisky
Yes. So the category, as you mentioned, is down 7% and very different by nut type, the walnut prices that we’ve already talked about came down. So we did see a little bit of growth in walnuts of 2%, but it was offset by the pecans and the almonds. Pecans have gone up about, I think, 7% in prices at retail on average and so we saw 11% drop. And the almonds went down 15% in the recipe nut category. But if you look at almonds overall, they were up 5%. As I think Jeffrey maybe mentioned in his commentary, we see -- and we see this every quarter some rotating between the different parts of the store. And in the case of almonds, we saw some strength in the produce section of the store and the snack section of the store as people rotated out of the recipe nut section. As overall almonds were up, but in recipe nuts, they were down as we measure it.
Mitch Pinheiro
Okay, that was helpful. And then, I guess, my final question just on gross margin. You’ve done a terrific job improving on such a sales decline, having an increasing gross profit, it’s terrific performance. The thing -- I’d love to understand, like what part of that is sustainable? I mean, as you look over the next couple of quarters, I mean, clearly you’re moving to -- you’re focused on higher-margin channels, your higher margin customers. Is that sustainable? Or is there some items in the quarter that sort of helped? I mean, you’ve done it all year long, that’s not just in this quarter, but what -- can you talk a little bit about that, that would be helpful?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
You want to cover that Mike? Or I was thinking...
Mike Valentine
Go ahead…
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Okay. So as we shift our focus from the industrial business, which was typically low margin, we shift from some of the lower margin consumer business into more branded and value added product type. That’s sustainable margin enhancement because we control the pricing, we control our brands, we control the spending against our brands. We control [indiscernible] as you see our bands grow, that is sustainable margin impact. As long as we’re not seeing huge shifts or fluctuations in commodity prices, we’ve got much better control over that margin going forward.
Operator 
And at this time I’m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Valentine for closing remarks.
Mike Valentine

John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. Strategically Expands its Market 
      Breadth and Product Capabilities in Produce with Acquisition of Leading 
      Nut and Dried Fruit Business






May 05, 2010 06:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ELGIN, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. (Nasdaq: JBSS) (hereinafter 
      the “Company” or “JBSS”) today announced that it has entered into a 
      definitive agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain 
      liabilities of Orchard Valley Harvest, Inc. of Modesto, California 
      (“OVH”) for $29.5 million in cash, plus additional future consideration 
      of up to $10.5 million, which is contingent upon performance of the 
      acquired business for the 2010 and 2011 calendar years, as more 
      specifically described in the definitive agreement. The acquisition will 
      be funded from excess availability in the JBSS bank credit facility. The 
      acquisition is expected to close prior to the completion of JBSS’ 
      current fiscal year ending June 24, 2010, subject to customary closing 
      conditions and adjustments.
    


      OVH is one of the nation’s leading suppliers of branded and private 
      label nut and dried fruit products in the produce category.
    

      “The acquisition of OVH fulfills a key pillar in JBSS’ five year 
      strategic plan by significantly increasing our presence in the produce 
      section of food retailers,” said Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, Chairman and CEO 
      of JBSS. “The perimeter of the store is where retailers have been 
      increasingly focusing their time and investment and where consumers have 
      more frequently been purchasing fruit and nut products. The acquisition 
      of OVH provides JBSS with meaningful product and packaging diversity and 
      significant access to one of the fastest growing channels for nut and 
      dried fruit products. According to consumer data, as reported by a major 
      market research firm, recent sales of nut and dried fruit products in 
      the produce section have grown faster than in other sections of food 
      retailers’ stores,” said Jeffrey Sanfilippo.
    

      The acquisition of OVH is anticipated to add approximately $50.0 million 
      to $60.0 million in incremental net sales on an annual basis. Based on 
      OVH’s financial statements for its 2008 and 2009 calendar years1, 
      OVH would have added approximately $.30 to $.40 per share to JBSS’ 
      earnings per share for those periods.
    

1 The OVH financial statements referenced herein are 
      unaudited and have not been prepared in accordance with Generally 
      Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The earnings per share amounts 
      set forth herein may differ from the amounts included in pro forma 
      financial statements when computed in accordance with GAAP, which will 
      be filed on Form 8-K at a later date.
    

      “The OVH management team is thrilled to become part of the JBSS family,” 
      said Steve Kerr, President of OVH. “We are excited about the opportunity 
      to leverage JBSS’ scale and position as the leading singularly focused 
      provider of nut and nut-related solutions to expand OVH’s market reach 
      in produce sections throughout the United States. With its unparalleled 
      processing and distribution capabilities in Illinois to supplement our 
      West Coast presence, JBSS is positioned to become the leading national 
      fruit and nut provider to produce sections,” concluded Steve Kerr.
    

      “The business that Steve Kerr, John Potter and the team at OVH have 
      built over the last eight years is impressive,” said Jeffrey Sanfilippo. 
      “OVH developed a successful business based upon a value added customer 
      centric approach. It was this philosophy, which we share, coupled with 
      OVH’s high quality and innovative product and packaging solutions, that 
      attracted us to what we strongly believe is a natural and strategic 
      complement to our current business. With OVH’s capabilities, JBSS is 
      ideally positioned to be a leading supplier of a full suite of branded 
      and private branded nut and nut-related products in the snack, baking 
      and produce categories,” concluded Jeffrey Sanfilippo.
    

      Some of the statements of Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo in this release are 
      forward-looking. These forward-looking statements may be generally 
      identified by the use of forward-looking words and phrases such as 
      “will”, “intends”, “may”, “believes”, and “expects” and are based on the 
      Company’s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and 
      involve risks and uncertainties. Consequently, the Company’s actual 
      results could differ materially. The Company undertakes no obligation to 
      update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, 
      whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors 
      that affect the subject of these statements, except where expressly 
      required to do so by law. Among the factors that could cause results to 
      differ materially from current expectations are: (i) the risks 
      associated with our vertically integrated model with respect to pecans, 
      peanuts and walnuts; (ii) sales activity for the Company’s products, 
      including a decline in sales to one or more key customers; (iii) changes 
      in the availability and costs of raw materials and the impact of fixed 
      price commitments with customers; (iv) the ability to measure and 
      estimate bulk inventory, fluctuations in the value and quantity of the 
      Company’s nut inventories due to fluctuations in the market prices of 
      nuts and bulk inventory estimation adjustments, respectively, and 
      decreases in the value of inventory held for other entities, where the 
      Company is financially responsible for such losses; (v) the Company’s 
      ability to lessen the negative impact of competitive and pricing 
      pressures; (vi) losses associated with product recalls or the potential 
      for lost sales or product liability if customers lose confidence in the 
      safety of the Company’s products or in nuts or nut products in general, 
      or are harmed as a result of using the Company’s products; (vii) 
      uncertainties and other matters regarding the Company’s Elgin, Illinois 
      facility, including the underutilization thereof; (viii) the ability of 
      the Company to retain key personnel; (ix) the Company’s largest 
      stockholder possessing a majority of aggregate voting power of the 
      Company, which may make a takeover or change in control more difficult; 
      (x) the potential negative impact of government regulations, including 
      the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response 
      Act and laws and regulations pertaining to food safety; (xi) the 
      Company’s ability to do business in emerging markets; (xii) 
      deterioration and uncertainty in economic conditions, including 
      restricted liquidity in financial markets, and the impact of these 
      conditions upon the Company’s lenders, customers and suppliers; (xiii) 
      the Company’s ability to obtain additional capital, if needed; (xiv) the 
      timing and occurrence (or nonoccurrence) of other transactions and 
      events which may be subject to circumstances beyond the Company’s 
      control and (xv) the challenges of integrating acquired businesses into 
      the Company’s operations and entering markets in which the Company has 
      limited experience.

Good day, ladies and gentleman. And welcome to the John B. Sanfilippo & Son Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Operating Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Mr. Franc Pellegrino, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may begin.
Franc Pellegrino
Thank you, Vicky. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our 2017 second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. I am here today in place of Mike Valentine, our CFO, was unable to make this call this morning. On the call with me today is Jeffrey Sanfilippo, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jasper Sanfilippo Jr., our President and Chief Operating Officer.
We may make some forward-looking statements today. These statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties. The factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various SEC filings that we have made including forms 10-K and 10-Q.
We encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about the risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business.
Starting with the income statement, net sales for second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 10.6% to $249.9 million in comparison to net sales for second quarter of fiscal 2016 of $279 million. The decrease in net sales was primary attributable to significantly lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts.
Sales volume declined by 3.8% due to decrease in sales volume in the commercial ingredients distribution channel. The sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel resulted from the loss of a common butter customer and lower sales of farmer stock peanuts to other peanut shellers and bought inshell walnuts to international customers due to the fact that we were not carrying excess inventories of farmer stock peanuts and inshell walnuts as it was case last year. Sales volume increased in the packaging and distribution channel from increase sales of peanuts and trail mixes to existing customer.
Sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel primarily from increased sales of our Fisher Recipe Nuts and Orchard Valley Harvest branded products, while sales volume for private brand products was relatively unchanged.
Fisher Recipe Nuts volume increased by 14.8%, primarily due to introduction of a larger package size for walnuts, distribution gains with new customers and increased promotional activity. Fisher Nut volume declines by 12.3%, due to decrease display opportunities and lower promotional activity, primarily as retailers do not report market dealer to IRI.
A 10.4 increase -- a 10.4% increase in combined sales volume for Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country produce products also contributed to sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel. The increase in sales volume for our produce brands resulted from a 43.4% increase in sales volume for Orchard Valley Harvest brand due to new item introductions. The OVH sales volume increase was partially offset by a decline in sales volume for Sunshine Country produce products, due to some loss distribution and existing customer.
Net sales for the first two quarters of the current year decreased to $471.7 million from $504.8 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The decline in net sales and a year-to-date comparison was also attributable primarily to significant lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts. Partially offsetting these lower selling prices was a 2.2% increase in sales volume.

Sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel from increase sales of Fisher Recipe Nuts, private brand snack nuts and Orchard Valley Harvest produce products. Sales volume increased in the contract packaging distribution channel primarily for the same reasons I previously noted in the quarterly comparison. Sales volume declined in the commercial ingredients distribution channel also for same reasons I cited in the quarterly comparison.
Second quarter gross profit decreased by $1.6 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.4% for the second quarter fiscal 2017 from 16.1% for the second quarter fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross profit dollars was mainly due to decreased sales volume. The increase in gross profit margin primarily resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for almonds, which was partially offset by higher commodity acquisition costs for pecans and cashews.
Gross profit for the first two quarters of the current year increased by $1.6 million, while gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.9% from 50.5% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The increases in gross profit and gross profit margin in the year-to-date comparison primarily resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for almonds and increased sales volume.
Total operating expenses for the current second quarter increased to 9.5% net sales from 9.1% for the second quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses for the current year-to-date period increased to 9.2% of net sales from 8.9% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The increase in total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in both the quarter and year-to-date comparisons were mainly due to a lower net sales base. Total operating expenses decreased by 6.6% in the quarterly comparison and 2.7% in the year-to-date comparison, decrease in compensation and advertising expenses were primary drivers for dollar decrease in total operating expenses.
Interest expense for the current second quarter was $600,000 compared to $800,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Interest expense for the first two quarters of the current year decreased to $1.2 million from $1.7 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest expense in both comparisons was attributable primarily to lower debt levels.
Income tax expense in the quarterly comparison favorably impacted but the company’s application of a recently adopted accounting standard relating to share-based compensation awards that vested during the current second quarter.
Now moving on to inventory, total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second -- at the end of the current second quarter decreased by $2.6 million, or 1.4%, compared to total inventory value at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in total value of inventories on hand was primarily driven by lower costs of finished goods which resulted from lower acquisition costs for walnuts and almonds.
The weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by 4.5% compared to the weighted average cost per pound at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks was mainly due to higher acquisition costs for pecans and cashews, which were offset in part by declines in walnut, almond and peanut acquisition costs.
Finally, our Board of Directors recently adopted a dividend policy under which it intends to pay an annual cash dividend on Common and Class A Stock. The annual dividend would be declared around the conclusion of our fiscal year and paid in the first quarter. We expect the dividend could be paid in the first quarter fiscal 2018 will be at least $0.50 per share.

I will now turn the call over to Jeffrey Sanfilippo, our CEO provides addition comments and our operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Thank you, Franc. Good morning, everyone. Coming up the strong momentum from our first quarter of fiscal ‘17 net income and diluted earnings per share reached record levels for any second fiscal quarter for the company. This is the fifth consecutive year the company has reported record second quarter operating results for net income and diluted earnings per share.
In addition to this as Franc just mentioned, we're pleased to announce our dividend policy. We believe to acknowledge the time to begin the practice of paying an annual dividend to our stockholders. This dividend policy advances our goals of creating long-term stockholder value and expanding our stockholder base and is supported by our strong financial performance.
The Board will also continue to consider the declaration of special dividends around the time of each annual meeting of stockholders just as we did this past year. In November Q2 at the annual stockholders meeting the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $2.50 per share on all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock of the company.
A special dividend was paid on December 13, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2016. This would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our management team and every one of our employees. I thank them for their hard work, leadership and supports.
We continue to execute our strategic plans to grow JBSS brands, expand consumer reach and provide best-in-class integrated nut solutions for key partners. We also remained focused on operational efficiencies to reduce costs and add production capabilities throughout our manufacturing and supply chain.
I will talk about changes in the core strategy to expand consumer reach and pursue alternative customer channels. We are making progress as we begin to execute our plans. We were successful in expanding JBSS’ snack brand into a major home-improvement retailer.
In addition, our food service chain is having initial success in expanding our distribution with non-commercial customers. We defined in the non-commercial customer as a location that sells food where food is not their primary business. This will include organizations such as colleges or universities cafeterias, healthcare institutions and corporate industry. As we continue to make progress I will highlight our activities on future calls.
Turning to our sales review by JBSS channel. Net sales in the consumer distribution channel decreased by 5.3% in dollars and increased 2.2% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The sales volume increase was driven by increased sales of our branded products. The increase in sales volume for our produce brands resulted from a 43.4% increase in sales volume for our Orchard Valley Harvest brand due to new item introductions which was partially offset by a decline in sales volume for Sunshine Country produce products due to lost distribution.
Net sales in the commercial ingredients distribution channel decreased by 36.2% in dollars and 29.1% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales volume decreased for the quarter, Franc mentioned, was primarily due to lower sales of peanuts to other peanut shellers, a loss of an almond butter customer and decreased sales of bulk inshell walnuts to international customers.
We’ve talked about optimizing our sales focus and here is a great example of how we shifted some of our volume to other channels where we are able to enhance our margins and improved inventory positions. We successfully replaced the lost sales volume in the industrial segment of our commercial ingredient channel with strong volume growth for our branded and contract packaging products.

In the contract packaging channel we saw -- again saw meaningful sales volume growth due to the efforts we made in assisting customers as they launched new peanut and trail mix products and gain new distribution.
Net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel increased by 7.3% in dollars and 13.7% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The sales volume increase for the quarter was primarily due to increased sales, as I mentioned, on a lot of trail mixes and peanuts to existing customers.
Turning now to category updates for our second quarter of fiscal 2017. As always the market information I'll be referring to is IRI reported data and today it is for the period ending December 25, 2016. When I refer to Q2 I'm referring to the 13 weeks ending December 25th. References to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one-year ago.
We look at the category and IRI's total U.S. definition, which includes food, drug, mass, Wal-Mart, military and other outlets. When we discuss pricing we’ll refer to average price per pound. Breakup of the recipe, snack and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with IRI. The term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution.
First let me review some category dynamics. The total nut category increased in pound volume by 2% and declined in dollar sales by 1% in Q2. Overall, prices at the macro level declined 3% versus year ago.
Now I will talk about each category in a little more depth, starting with recipe nuts. In Q2 the recipe nut category struggled declining 9% in dollars sales and 4% in pound sales. Walnut pound sales were up 9% driven by 22% decline in weighted average walnut prices versus the prior year. But the walnut pound sales increase was offset by pecans and almonds.
Pecan pound sales decline 10% driven by a 9% increase in average prices versus the prior year and almond pound sales declined 13% despite a 6% decrease in average prices. Consumers appear to have migrated to the snack or produce section of the store for almonds as almond pound consumption in both these sections increased versus last year.
Our Fisher brand had a very strong quarter and continues to gain momentum behind our integrated marketing efforts. Fisher recipe nuts increased 16% in dollars sales and 21% in pound sales in the quarter versus last year. As a result, Fisher pound share in the category increased 6.2 points versus last year. Fisher recipe continues as a leading branded recipe nut with an overall share of 29.9%, which is 12.4% -- 12.4 share points ahead of our nearest branded competitor. 
The growth was driven by an increase in distribution of 8 percentage points of ACV, as our sales team continues to translate our retail success into greater retail penetration. Distribution for Fisher recipe nuts is now at 57% ACV.
In addition to the distribution gains, pound velocity increased 18%. The velocity growth was driven by strong merchandising performance at new and existing customers and the effectiveness of our brand, no preservatives and non-GMO messaging. Our continued brand equity efforts on Fisher coupled with our distribution gains helped the brand overcome category weakness and deliver growth in Q2.
Now let me turn to the snack category. In Q2 the snack category decreased 2% in dollar sales and was flat in pound sales versus last year, and weighted average prices decreased 2% driven by declines in almonds of 8% and in peanuts of 3%.
Fisher snack increased by 10% in sales dollars and 35% in pound sales as measured by IRI in Q2. The increase was driven by new distribution and an increase in pound velocity of 18% as measured by IRI. Fisher sales volume, however, declined 12.3% overall due to declines at non-IRI customers.

Orchard Valley Harvest business had a strong Q2 quarter increasing 73% in dollar sales and 79% in pound sales. Orchard Valley Harvest grew faster than the category, which was up roughly 10% in pound, resulting in three-tenths of a point increase in pound share. Our ACV distribution has increased to 34% nationally and our velocity increased 50% by strong merchandising efforts.
We have continued to build on this success by launching new products such as our omega-3 mix and a dark -- and dark chocolate covered fruits both in multipacks. Sunshine Country, our other brand in the produce section of the store did not perform as well as Orchard Valley Harvest. The brand declined 15% in dollars and 11% in pound sales. The brand declined in sales as we were overlapping aggressive merchandising last year at the key customer. Our total produce business Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country grew 25% in pounds in the second quarter compared to a year ago.
In closing, we have seen record increase as an acquisition cost recently for pecans in the 2016 crop year, which falls into our current fiscal 2017 year, and we also have seen significant increases in cashew acquisition costs. The almond and walnut market prices have start getting stronger with higher demand for walnuts globally and almonds internationally. So we will be taking price increases in Q3.
While we face competitive challenges every year that impact our company we have proven our ability to manage through volatile markets and we have volume challenges and headwinds going into the remaining back half of fiscal ’17, but the management team remains focused on consistent execution of our corporate goals to create customer and shareholder value.
Our resources are devoted to three specific areas, expansion of national distribution of our Fisher and Orchard Valley Harvest branded products, expansion of our customer reach by entering new distribution channels, launching differentiated products and investing in new businesses, and continue value-added growth of non-branded business with our key customers.
We appreciate your participate in the call and thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to Franc. And since Mike is out of the office today, if you have questions after the call, please contact Franc at area code 847-214-4138. Thank you.
Franc Pellegrino
Thanks, Jeff. We will now open the call to questions. Vicky, please queue up the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Francesco Pellegrino with Sidoti and Company. Your line is now open.
Francesco Pellegrino
Good morning, guys.
Jasper Sanfilippo
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Hi, Franc.
Francesco Pellegrino
So, first off, the special dividend, it seems there has been something in the works for quite some time now. Congrats on that. But just want to hear your thought process behind it, why we are sorting out with a modest dividend just in the first quarter as compared to maybe spreading it out evenly amongst all four quarters and maybe where the dividend can go going forward and also if you will still be considering special dividend as well?
Sure. Francesco, this is Jeffrey. So we have talked about a dividend policy over the last couple years, actually something I have focused on and I wanted to do for a long time, obviously, our financial performance has been extremely strong and it always us to put a policy in place. The $0.50 minimum that we’ve talked about was something that we felt comfortable with putting out there initially. We will be considering special dividends throughout the year as well, just as we have done in the last couple years, usually announced our stockholders meeting in -- at the end of the year.

Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. So the, look, you guys are reporting record results, it seems like quarter after quarter after quarter, is there right now certain loss that the company could incur, while still maintaining this $0.50 dividend, if you incur $10 million loss, let's say, next year, let’s say in 2019, would you still be able to support the dividend going forward in the first quarter of 2020, for example.
Jasper Sanfilippo
We don’t anticipate losing $10 million anytime soon but based on our availability we believe that no that’s stable for awhile.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. So regardless of the volatility in earnings you guys will be able to just consistently payout this dividend, it sounds like given just how modest it is?
Jasper Sanfilippo
We believe so.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
No, it’s a, Francisco, we really focus on managing that volatility, I think, we have proven that over the last couple years. We are not the same company we were even three years ago with our focus on building our branded business, adding value at key customers and now expanding our consumer reach. So I don’t anticipate we are going to have a huge fluctuation in commodity impact that we've seen in past years. That’s why we are confident in establishing the dividend policy today.
Francesco Pellegrino
Without a doubt and you guys have done a phenomenal job of just growing out your brand which has almost created like this nice branded mode around the commodities that you ultimately buy and then sell. I just want to move over to volume, so I guess, when it looks, given my expectations for the quarters, just where nut prices are going and that we would get a little bit more turnover in the quarter, but when I think about some of the elevated volume sales that you had in the, what was it, the commercial ingredients line that, you sort of have done a really great job of, sort of telling us, hey, probably you are going to be there in Q2 whether it would be almond butter or it was the inshell walnuts sales or it was peanut sales to other peanut processors. I get why volume was going to be up next, but is there would maybe quantify what that volume was in the year ago period?
Jasper Sanfilippo
For those three items, those three items slightly represented over 5 million pounds for the quarter.
Francesco Pellegrino
So they represented over 5 million pound essentially if we strip that out from the year ago period volumes are basically up.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Yes.
Jasper Sanfilippo
And the volumes are up on our Fisher brand which is the part of our business we are focusing on, combined Fisher brand volume was, I think, up approximately 8% quarter-over-quarter.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. I'm sorry, what was that, start again.
Jasper Sanfilippo
Our volume is up on in the Fisher brand business and the consumer channel I believe volume is up around 8% for total Fisher which includes recipe and snack.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. I noticed in the first you guys also give us a volume performance against the consolidated brand, as well as private label, noticed that sort of what’s there in the 2Q release, anyway to get that, if you have it handy?
Jasper Sanfilippo
It’s in the press release, the private label is flat for the quarter.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. And branded was…
Jasper Sanfilippo
Total brand is approximately 8%.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. So, based upon some of the things that I may able to back into, I see branded revenue up 7%, branded volumes up 8%, so that's pretty nice. But then I see private label revenue down 13%, make sense it’s lower selling prices, would have thought you would have got a little bit more turnover. I see that you did address why volume was flat year-over-year with what I'm thinking it probably maybe a single large customer is flat volume just maybe a concern in 2Q or can we expect the volumes to sort of rebound in Q3 and Q4 for this private label business?

Jeffrey Sanfilippo
This is Jeffrey, Francisco. So there were some dynamic that we had no control over, some of the things that some of our key retail partners did with their shelf allocation and some of the category management decisions they made that had negative impact on their private brand volume. We anticipate that they are going to make some positive changes going into our Q3 and Q4 to turn that volume around.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. Contract packaging, when I just think about that distribution channel, I see you guys have new distribution, looks like new additional volume from trial mix and peanut sales. Is this with a single customer, a single -- one of your bigger customers or is it sort of spread out just be a greater distribution amongst the collective host of customers?
Jasper Sanfilippo
Yeah. Francisco, this is Jasper. I would say that it’s kind of mix of a small handful of contract manufacturing customers currently equally.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. Looking at the Fisher snack, I saw that was down almost Fisher snack down, Fisher snack nuts were down 12% on volume, is it the timing thing with the promotional spend?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Yeah. Part of its timing, part of it, you saw we are seeing retailers look at cleaner lower policies, where they are not putting as much distribution on the floor during Q2, so which reduces some of the merchandising opportunities that we have the prior year. So little bit of is changing merchandising strategy at the retail level, but some that is also timing. We anticipate to make some that up.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. I got a couple more questions, but I am willing to come back in queue, if anyone has anything.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Thanks, Francisco.
Jasper Sanfilippo
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow-up from Francesco Pellegrino with Sidoti and Company. Your line is now open.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. I am back. So let’s talk about Sunshine Country for a minute. Right now is Sunshine Country, is the volume base for that brand larger than OVH?
Jasper Sanfilippo
No. It's not.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. It’s not, what's happening with that brand and to be honest with you, when I think about produce, a large part of the conversation has really been around the stellar performance of OVH and I don’t say Sunshine Country has been a neglected brand, but I would just think that, I don't know if there's distribution problems or maybe there's more excitement around OVH, that's where the focus is, is there retrenchment strategy that maybe happening behind the scene with Sunshine Country that allows you to maybe focus more on building the brand equity within OVH, something is happening and I'm just wondering if maybe that brand might be having some problems behind the scenes?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Sure. Just to clarify, Orchard Valley Harvest is our premium produce brand. It is -- the positioning is after the health and wellness consumer. Sunshine Country is a control. We consider a control brand. It is our lower and product mix, lower price point. It’s really with one key retailer at this point. If that key retailer changes some other dynamics from a shelf allocation standpoint, that’s where you are seeing such an impact on Sunshine Country brand.
It is funny that we are still focus on. There are still a great opportunity for lower price point brands in the produce category, something that our sales and marketing team is working on to look beyond the current customer that has -- that takes Sunshine Country and expand that distribution, because there is an opportunity to grow that brand as well.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. With pecan market, so it doesn't sound like if there's any like really supply issues and I think, I actually saw that the pecan yield or the total harvest is going to be up slightly and it -- I've heard that there was like the irrational pecan buyer out there that sort of causing pecan prices to remain elevated and continue to run? And I'm just wondering since you are vertically integrated for pecan, are you being maybe a little bit less aggressive now in your purchasing habits and potentially seeing lower prices later on in the year? I'm just wondering where this market is going and what’s the rationale behind prices continuing to be at this level?

Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Francisco, this is Jeffrey. So lot of dynamics happening in the pecan industry, first of all, the supply this year was at average level something there was last year and really for the last subsequent years. We have not had a major increase in the pecan supply for quite a long time. So while the supply has been fairly stagnant, demand is continue to grow especially in China. We anticipate China will import close to 90 million pounds of pecans this year and so part of this is supply standpoint being stagnant, demand is growing internationally. So that is one piece that’s driving reasons for increases.
Second one there has been dynamic changes within the buyers for sheller of pecans. There has been some consolidation in the industry. Private equity has invested in a couple pecan shellers recently. So we got more cash available to buy the pecan crop and we did see some what we would consider unrealistic purchasing habits by some of these new entrants in the marketplace. So it has driven the inshell supplier. The demand don’t remain strong and so the meat market has remained relatively strong as a result.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. And final question for me, so, in the first quarter you were lapping first quarter from 1Q ‘16 where volume was flat, setting you up like a nice volume opportunity to beat in 1Q ’17, which you did with 10% -- with the 10% increase in volume. We just lapped the really difficult quarter from the year ago period unless you had 9% volume growth. Now we got volume down 4%, but I guess, when we look at some of the earlier questions that I had, you had some elevated lower margin business that’s really not in 2017, going forward in the second half of 2017 and I know you guys don't give guidance on volume sales, but should we be thinking about in regards to this tough comp that’s going to be happening in the second half?
Jasper Sanfilippo
The volume for the second half, again, we had a very good comp last year. We have to in order to meet that comp we have to make up this right way this almond butter business. And please remember last year in Q4 we had an extra week, so this year we don’t -- this year we don’t have that extra week. So it’s even more difficult to meet last year’s volume.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
On that I would add Francisco, the sales and marketing team are very focused on volume growth. They’ve done a great job margining up the business and really focus on building the brands. We are keenly aware that we need to look at the new distribution, the new strategy of expanding consumer reach is going to be critical to go after new volume growth. So we have a lot of headwinds going into the back half with the loss of that major industrial almond butter customer.
The categories are down. If you, the recipe nut category is down overall domestically and there are couple other headwinds from a consumption standpoint domestically that we need to overcome. But we are -- that’s why it’s so important that we expand our consumer reach, getting to new customers and new channels and really focus on developing new innovative products for our key partners.
Francesco Pellegrino
But when you talk about these headwinds and I guess what we saw with, what happened to the overall volume number this quarter. You guys could have lacked to down volumes sales and still be producing recordable -- maybe not recordable EPS in the third quarter, but maybe record EPS in the fourth quarter, because you guys have really reduced your selling expense and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the year ago period. So are we just getting maybe the right product mix or is there too many different dynamics occurring on a quarterly basis that it's really hard extrapolate these trends going forward?

Jasper Sanfilippo
There is a lot of dynamics happened once, if you recall, we are -- we have streamlined some of our SG&A expenses and we do have a better price mix, now since we don’t have that lower margin industrial customer any longer, so we do expect margins to improve going forward. Again, there is a lot of mix volume and pricing awesome play.
Francesco Pellegrino
Okay. Perfect. Thanks again.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Thanks, Francisco.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Stefan Mykytiuk with ACK Asset Management. Your line is now open.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Hi. Good morning.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Good morning, Stefan.
Stefan Mykytiuk
So just following up on, a little bit on what Francisco was asking and Jeffrey you alluded to this earlier, but going back 10 years or 12 years, this is a very different company, I think you said before even three, four years ago, this is a very different company. So you lost, you shed 5 million pounds of what I would expect is low margin business this quarter and it sounds like we will have some continued flow through of that certainly from the almond butter in the next couple quarters. But the history of this company seems to be that you're moving your mix, you are bidding, but you have done that over the last 10 years at times and then recapture that volume through higher value-added either branded or private label or contract packaging business. So is this, the 5 million pound this quarter is this part of that whole kind of game plan to keep moving the value-added mix up and continue to improve the complexity of this business?
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
That’s correct, Stefan, that’s exactly what we are doing. We are shifting a lot, as I mentioned, the shift from our inshell walnuts internationally into more domestic shelled branded products and is an example of that. The almond butter in the industrial chattel making up that volume, we are really focusing our efforts on the branded piece of it and also our key partners that we provide their private brands for, there is lot of growth opportunities with them as well. So some strange industry dynamics happened this past two quarters really. We anticipate that they are going to be refocusing their efforts on the snack nut category to turn that volume around. Yes, we have shifted the volume from that lower margin industrial business and in some cases some of the international business to more profit business here.
Franc Pellegrino
And also, this is Franc, that’s also through the consumer channel, back couple years ago our private label consumer channel was probably low in the branded piece of our consumer channels [ph] probably (36:21) low 30% and this quarter we picked that 43%, so we are shifting from private label to branded, just part of strategy.
Stefan Mykytiuk
That’s 43%...
Franc Pellegrino
Of the consumer channel.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Of the consumer.
Franc Pellegrino
Yeah.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Got it. Got it. So as I look over the next few years, is it fair to assume we should expect or your game plan is to resume volume growth of overtime and then as you improve the mix that we should see improving margins in the business?
Franc Pellegrino
Absolutely.
Stefan Mykytiuk
Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much.
Jeffrey Sanfilippo
Thank you.
Operator
And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Franc Pellegrino for closing remarks.

Sanfilippo


NUTS AND SNACKS  ELK GROVE VILLAGE
Jasper B. Sanfilippo, 74, chairman and CEO, John B. Sanfilippo & Son Inc.Mathias A. Valentine, 70, president (Jasper's brother-in-law)Michael J. Valentine, 45, chief financial officer (Mathias' son)Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, 42, executive vice-president of sales and marketing (Jasper's son)Jasper V. Sanfilippo Jr., 38, executive vice-president of operations (Jasper's son)James A. Valentine, 41, executive vice-president of information technology (Mathias' son)Lisa Valentine, 41, manager of industrial sales (Mathias' daughter)
Back story: Sanfilippo is the No. 2 processor and marketer of nuts in the U.S., after Planters, and the Sanfilippo family directly controls about one-fourth of all company stock, making their holdings in the aggregate worth about $50 million recently.
The company was founded in the 1920s by Jasper's father, John Sanfilippo, an Italian immigrant who worked shelling pecans before his 10th birthday. Jasper, with a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois, took over the business when his father died in 1963, when annual sales ran about $300,000. He introduced automated machines that shelled nuts much faster than laborers working by hand, who could shell 12 pounds of peanuts an hour on a good day. The company prospered on his patents, which include a machine that injects salt inside peanut shells, and was taken public in 1991. Today, there are about 2,000 employees at the height of the holiday season, the busiest time. A move to new headquarters in Elgin, being built at a cost exceeding $70 million, is planned for summer 2006.
Too many family ties? For years, Jasper Sr. and brother-in-law Mathias Valentine have run Sanfilippo almost as a partnership, surrounded by family members in practically every executive post that matters. That's bothered some analysts.
Home life: The senior Jasper Sanfilippo lives in a 64,000-square-foot house in Barrington Hills, with most of his children living elsewhere around the 100-acre estate. The Valentine branch of the family lives more modestly in Park Ridge.
Nearly half of Jasper's house is given over to a grand concert hall, called the Palace Musique, with a 75-foot ceiling decorated in a fairy-tale Second Empire style. It's here that Jasper houses his collection of musical instruments, ranging from a massive old Wurlitzer organ to more than 100 music boxes, automatic pianos and orchestrions, self-contained orchestras in miniature. Many are more than a century old and have been meticulously restored under a music maintenance budget that runs more than $400,000 a year.
The elder Sanfilippo doesn't play an instrument himself. His concert hall has seating for 300 and is the setting for regular performances by guest artists, often for the benefit of local charities such as the Barrington Youth Dance Ensemble, St. Anne's Catholic Church and Hopeful Heart. Jasper's collecting doesn't stop with music: In various barns on his property he also keeps antique locomotives, circus carousels, slot machines, penny arcades, 1920s-era Rolls-Royces and tower bells from old Chicago churches.
Good connections: Former Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar is a friend and a member of the company's board. CEOs Renato Turano of Campagna-Turano Bakery Inc. and Salvatore Ferrara of Ferrara Pan Candy Co. both are Jasper's old friends.
