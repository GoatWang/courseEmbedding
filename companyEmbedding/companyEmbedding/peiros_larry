Clorox’s Larry Peiros To Retire

Posted by         Kristen Cloud

Date: October 30, 2012
in: Executive Moves, National
Leave a comment





  

The Clorox Co.’s EVP and COO, Lawrence S. “Larry” Peiros, plans to retire from the company, effective April 1. The 57-year-old joined Oakland, Calif.-based Clorox in 1980 as a summer intern, was appointed a member of the company’s executive committee in 1999 and to the COO role in 2007.
In addition to his current role having overall responsibility for the company’s businesses, he also oversees the marketing, sales, research and development, and product supply functions as well as Clorox’s Eco Office.
“Larry’s influence and leadership have been profound,” said Chairman and CEO Don Knauss. “He strongly led our businesses and core functions, helping to grow sales and market share over a multiyear period. Throughout his 32 years, Larry has been selfless in driving the success of the business and the organization. We are indebted to him for his many contributions and wish him the very best.”
“Few have been so fortunate to work with such a great company and such a great group of people for so many years. It has been a great ride,” Peiros said. “I will always bleed ‘Clorox blue,’ but this is the right time for me to pass the baton to a new group of terrific Clorox leaders.”
Effective Jan. 1, the company will move to a structure with two COOs; and the following leaders have been named to new positions, accordingly.
Benno Dorer
Benno Dorer, 48, currently SVP-cleaning division and Canada, will be promoted to EVP and COO-cleaning, international and corporate strategy. As such, Dorer will have responsibility for the laundry, home care and international business units as well as take on responsibility for corporate strategy and growth.
George Roeth
George Roeth, 51, currently SVP-specialty division, will be promoted to EVP and COO-household and lifestyle. Roeth will have responsibility for the Charcoal, Glad, Litter, Food, Brita and Burt’s Bees business units. He also will have responsibility for the company’s core functions: marketing, sales, product supply and research and development.
Commenting on these promotions, Knauss said, “The board and executive management team’s robust succession planning has enabled us to appoint strong leaders to these roles, and will enable a smooth transition while maintaining the strong governance structure of the company.
“In his nearly eight years at Clorox, Benno has led a number of Clorox businesses and has had a strong impact on several corporate initiatives and capabilities. He helped create the Glad Joint Venture with Procter & Gamble and led the Glad business to significant increases in revenue, profit and market share through strategic focus, a shift toward premium products and cost savings. He has led the Home Care business to sustained economic profit growth and record-high market shares over multiple years through strategic reorientation, disciplined portfolio management and effective supply chain transformation. Prior to Clorox, he spent 14 years with P&G, Dorer held marketing positions across a broad range of businesses worldwide.
“During his 25 years of service, George has led the company’s global marketing functions, the Growth & Strategy office in addition to his past eight years successfully leading several of our businesses. With his marketing and general management roles, he has worked on nearly every business across the company. As general manager of the Specialty division, George has led sustained and rapid share growth of the Hidden Valley and Kingsford franchises through disciplined strategies and integrated demand-building capabilities. He worked in partnership with Product Supply and R&D to modernize the Glad manufacturing platform to lower costs and accelerate innovation while delivering improved sales and profit growth.”

Longtime Clorox Executive Larry Peiros Honored With ACI Distinguished Service Award 
















        Tweet






Sponsors


















Larry Peiros, a longtime Clorox Company executive who played a leadership role for 15 years at the American Cleaning Institute, is the recipient of ACI’s 2013 Distinguished Service Award.


 


The honor was presented at ACI’s  2013 Annual Meeting & Industry Convention held at the Grande Lakes Orlando, Fla.


 


Peiros is the retiring Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer at The Clorox Company. He joined Clorox in 1980 as a summer intern, was appointed a member of the company's executive committee in 1999 and elevated to the COO role in 2007.


 


Most recently, he had overall responsibility for all of the company's businesses, and oversaw the Marketing, Sales, Research & Development and Product Supply functions, as well as Clorox's Eco Office, which is responsible for implementing the company’s global environmental sustainability strategy. He is retiring on April 1, 2013.


 


Peiros was active in the work of ACI for over 15 years. He served on ACI’s Board of Directors for 12 years, as chair of the Finance Committee and Treasurer from 2008-2009, contributing to ACI’s strong financial position. He further provided leadership, serving on the Board’s Executive Committee from 2008-2010.


 


“Larry Peiros has been a tremendous asset to ACI and to the cleaning products industry at-large,” said Ernie Rosenberg, ACI President & CEO. “Those of us on the staff who have worked with him directly have deep respect and affection.


 


“A mere recitation of the positions he’s held does not capture how much of a contribution he has made and how important his leadership has been to the development of the Institute and its staff.  I am personally deeply grateful that I had the opportunity to work with and learn from Larry,” Rosenberg added.


 


“For decades, ACI has been at the forefront of promoting the benefits of cleaning products and protecting the ability of its members to formulate products that best meet consumer needs” said Larry Peiros. “It has been exciting and personally fulfilling to be a part of this effort, working with respected leaders from other member companies as well as a group of extremely capable professionals that make up the ACI staff.”


 


ACI’s Distinguished Service Award is named in honor of the late Elva Walker Spillane, the former National Purity LLC chief executive who served on the association’s Board for 20 years.


 


The award honors an individual for extensive or exceptional service to ACI, who promoted the growth and interests of the Institute and the industries it represents; and who exercised outstanding leadership within the Institute.

Larry Peiros Appointed to Annie's Board of Directors







Share














Business Wirevia The Motley Fool, AOL.com
Mar 1st 2013 4:35PM




Larry Peiros Appointed to Annie's Board of DirectorsBoard of Directors to Recommend Declassification of Board at Annual MeetingBERKELEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Annie's, Inc.  (NYS: BNNY) , a leading natural and organic food company, today announced Lawrence (Larry) Peiros has been appointed to its Board of Directors effective immediately. David Behnke, a Managing Director at Najeti Ventures, resigned from the Board to pursue other interests. Mr. Peiros was appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy. The Company also announced that the Board of Directors will recommend that stockholders vote to declassify the Board at the next annual meeting."We are pleased to have Larry join the Board of Directors," John Foraker, CEO of Annie's, said. "His broad consumer product experience and business judgment will be valuable to the Annie's board as we grow our business. I also want to thank David Behnke for his support and service as an investor and board member."Mr. Peiros has more than 30 years of operating and marketing experience in the consumer packaged goods industry with Clorox Company, which he joined in 1981. He currently is a member of Clorox's Executive Committee and serves as its Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Peiros has previously announced that he will retire from Clorox effective April 1, 2013. As the COO, Mr. Peiros oversees Clorox's global business, including the Burt's Bees and Green Works brands, and leads the company's marketing, sales, product supply and research and development functions, as well as its environmental efforts. Previously, he was the company's Chief Operating Officer of Clorox North America, responsible for U.S. and Canadian businesses accounting for more than 80% of the company's sales. Mr. Peiros serves as a Director of Potlatch Corporation, a timberland real estate investment trust, and Ross Stores, operator of the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States. He holds a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College and a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University.In addition, as part of its commitment to accepted best practices of corporate governance, the Board of Directors intends to recommend that the Company's charter and bylaws be amended to declassify the Board of Directors at the next annual meeting of stockholders to be held later this year. If the stockholders approve this proposal, all of the Company's directors would be elected annually to serve one-year terms. The Board also appointed Mr. Pieros to its Compensation Committee, which he will chair, and director Julie Klapstein to its Audit Committee to fill the vacancies on those committees caused by Mr. Behnke's resignation. In addition, Mr. Pieros will replace Molly Ashby, Chairman of the Board of Directors, on the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. As a result, all of the Board's committees are now fully independent.Molly Ashby said, "The Board believes the addition of Mr. Peiros and the declassification of the Board are in the best interest of the Company and all its stockholders."About Annie'sAnnie's  (NYS: BNNY)  is a natural and organic food company that offers great-tasting products in large packaged food categories. Annie's products are made without artificial flavors and synthetic colors and preservatives regularly used in many conventional packaged foods. Today, Annie's offers more than 125 products and is present in over 25,000 retail locations in the United States and Canada.

Clorox’s Larry Peiros Honored With 
ACI Distinguished Service Award

Retiring EVP & COO Spent 30+ Years with Clorox, Served on ACI Board for 12 Years
Elva Walker Spillane Award Presented at 2013 ACI Convention

WASHINGTON, DC, January 31, 2013 – Larry Peiros, a longtime Clorox Company executive who played a leadership role for 15 years at the American Cleaning Institute, is the recipient of ACI’s 2013 Distinguished Service Award.
The honor was presented at ACI’s  2013 Annual Meeting & Industry Convention held at the Grande Lakes Orlando (Florida).
Peiros is the retiring Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer at The Clorox Company. He joined Clorox in 1980 as a summer intern, was appointed a member of the company's executive committee in 1999 and elevated to the COO role in 2007.
Most recently, he had overall responsibility for all of the company's businesses, and oversaw the Marketing, Sales, Research & Development and Product Supply functions, as well as Clorox's Eco Office, which is responsible for implementing the company’s global environmental sustainability strategy. He is retiring on April 1, 2013.
Peiros was active in the work of ACI for over 15 years. He served on ACI’s Board of Directors for 12 years, as chair of the Finance Committee and Treasurer from 2008-2009, contributing to ACI’s strong financial position. He further provided leadership, serving on the Board’s Executive Committee from 2008-2010.
"Larry Peiros has been a tremendous asset to ACI and to the cleaning products industry at-large," said Ernie Rosenberg, ACI President & CEO. "Those of us on the staff who have worked with him directly have deep respect and affection.
"A mere recitation of the positions he’s held does not capture how much of a contribution he has made and how important his leadership has been to the development of the Institute and its staff.  I am personally deeply grateful that I had the opportunity to work with and learn from Larry," Rosenberg added.
"For decades, ACI has been at the forefront of promoting the benefits of cleaning products and protecting the ability of its members to formulate products that best meet consumer needs" said Larry Peiros. "It has been exciting and personally fulfilling to be a part of this effort, working with respected leaders from other member companies as well as a group of extremely capable professionals that make up the ACI staff."
ACI’s Distinguished Service Award is named in honor of the late Elva Walker Spillane, the former National Purity LLC chief executive who served on the association’s Board for 20 years.
The award honors an individual for extensive or exceptional service to ACI, who promoted the growth and interests of the Institute and the industries it represents; and who exercised outstanding leadership within the Institute.
