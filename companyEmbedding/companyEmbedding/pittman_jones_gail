Because they all absolutely apply to Gail Pittman!  We used Gail Pittman Blue Birds for our "trophies" awarded to winning float entries in the Zippity Doo Dah Parade in Fondren--and the winners were thrilled to get something BEAUTIFUL they could enjoy displaying--as opposed to an ugly trophy.  Gail Pittman is As Good As It Gets--and her designs and products reflect all that is Good about her.See moreSee lessGail shares her entrepeneurial spirit and inspires others, especially women,  to be their best.   Her designs and artwork are beautiful and her creative style is admired by many.  Working with Gail, first as our Signature Vendor and later as our Creative Director, empowered me to be a better leader and manager in my business.
