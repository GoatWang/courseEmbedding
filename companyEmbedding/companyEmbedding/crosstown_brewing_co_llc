It is hard to imagine that, 10 years ago, Memphis had one craft brewery and zero taprooms. Ghost River Brewing Co., the city’s modern beer pioneer, was founded in 2007, and its taproom opened in 2016. Today, Ghost River is joined by High Cotton Brewing Co., Wiseacre Brewing Co., Memphis Made Brewing Co., the newly established Meddlesome Brewing Co. and the soon-to-be established Crosstown Brewing Co. While their beers are the stars, Memphis’ taprooms have become pleasant places to spend an afternoon or an evening, and they are often accompanied by food trucks, live music and even lawn games.

                827 S. Main St. Wed.-Thurs.: 4-10:30 p.m. Fri.-Sat.: Noon-11 p.m. Sun.: Noon-9 p.m.            






 


827 S. Main St.
Wed.-Thurs.: 4-10:30 p.m. Fri.-Sat.: Noon-11 p.m. Sun.: Noon-9 p.m.
Before South Main was the place to be, Ghost River was a resident.
Located at the corner of South Main Street and East E.H. Crump Boulevard, Ghost River’s neighborhood has changed considerably over the past decade, as redevelopment projects and construction have meant a once-remote location is now closer than ever to the action.
Last year was pivotal for Ghost River with the launch of a rebranded look as well as the debut of its taproom.
“It is interesting to see, being down here 10 years, the walkability of South Main now and how many people are walking to us,” said Suzanne Feinstone, director of marketing for Ghost River. “It used to be they would walk under that bridge and there was shock on their faces like, ‘Where am I?’ It is exciting — [the area] has changed so much.”
After a few months of taproom operation, Ghost River decided to open earlier on Fridays to better accommodate Downtown tourists and residents who, thanks to free Wi-Fi, can wrap up their workday at the brewery.
The taproom hosts events such as songwriter nights and is considering starting “dock parties” — live music on Ghost River’s loading docks.
“This place is really fluid in that way — It can be whatever you need it to be,” said Emma Meskovic, taproom manager for Ghost River.

“I have had people come here and just read a book by themselves,” Meskovic said. “I have seen people just work on some art. It is like a coffee house — but not.”
High Cotton Brewing Co.
598 Monroe Ave.
Tues.-Fri.: 4-9 p.m. Sat.: 2-10 p.m. Sun.: 1-6 p.m.
High Cotton Brewing Co., located in the up-and-coming Edge District and just a short walk from historic Sun Studio, sold its first keg in May 2013.
A year later, it opened its taproom.
Besides the typical amenities, High Cotton offers weekly yoga and trivia and monthly comedy shows. It also tries to host at least one philanthropic event every other month.




Asked if it feels like the bar — so to speak — for local breweries continues to be raised, High Cotton’s taproom manager, Cayleigh Tralongo, said it is all about consistency.
“In terms of the product we put out, we are always challenged to continue with consistency,” Tralongo said. “We strive [to always have] a consistent product — we love feedback from customers about that.”
Ryan Staggs, co-owner and founder of High Cotton, said they rent their space out about six to 10 times a month for everything from birthday parties and rehearsal dinners to continuing education classes.
But, one thing visitors can be assured of, the front taproom will always be open to customers during regular hours. A backroom and patio accommodate rentals during that time.
“We have been somewhat successful in renting the space because it is contrary to a typical event space,” Staggs said.
“We don’t have a tremendous amount of rules and regulations, and it is a very comfortable environment,” Staggs said. “Beer is the common man’s drink .”
Wiseacre Brewing Co.
2783 Broad Ave.
Mon.-Thurs.: 4-10 p.m. Fri.-Sat.: 1-10 p.m.
When Wiseacre Brewing Co. cut the ribbon on its Broad Avenue home in 2013, the taproom movement was started in Memphis.
“We thought it was a really important part of our business as a place for people to get to know us,” said Kellan Bartosch, co-founder of Wiseacre with his brother, Davin Bartosch. “Our industry is very grassroots. We wanted to be able to connect with people when they had questions.”
That emphasis on connectivity is why there are no TVs in the taproom, and it’s the same reason the tables are communal.
While they never thought the bar would be as busy as it is — which Kellan Bartosch said is a bonus — Wiseacre now offers three event rental options: the Gemütlichkeit Room, a small indoor space; The Chautauqua, an outdoor pavilion; or the taproom.
Wiseacre is renowned for its own functions, such as the annual Taste the Rarity festival and the recently launched Camp Chautauqua, modeled after a social movement that swept across the U.S. more than a century ago — like an adult summer camp.
“We don’t think beer is the most important thing in the world, but I think it is a component of culture,” Bartosch said. “People who live anywhere want to have a good food scene and a good music scene and a sports team. Different people are interested in different things. I think [the taproom] was a component that wasn’tthere in Memphis when we got started, and now people have the opportunity to visit taprooms and different breweries.”
Memphis Made Brewing Co.
768 Cooper St.
Mon.: 4-7 p.m. Thurs.-Fri.: 4-10 p.m. Sat.: 1-10 p.m. Sun.: 1-7 p.m.
At the gateway to Cooper Young sits Memphis Made Brewing Co.
A former Keathley Pie Factory warehouse, Memphis Made debuted its beer in October 2013. The taproom followed a year later.
“We knew the demand was there [for a taproom],” said Andy Ashby, co-founder of Memphis Made (and a former reporter for the Memphis Business Journal). “We are a little different from other breweries in that we are in the middle of a residential neighborhood. People walk up here, and that has kind of informed us as a company.”
The event space — divided from the main taproom by a shipping container — was added a year after the taproom opened, in response to customer demand. The back patio on the building is another Memphis Made rental option, and rentals account for 5 percent to 8 percent of the brewery’s monthly revenue.
“It is kind of the icing on the cake, really,” Ashby said. “Producing beer and the taproom is a big focus, and events is just a little bit of an extra thing — an additional revenue stream.”




 


Memphis Made also holds monthly community concerts and weekly bingo and trivia.
Drew Barton, president and head brewer for Memphis Made, said they frequently talk about how can they make the space more engaging.
“We are always trying to add a little bit to the taproom, so the next time you come, you can be like, ‘Oh, that’s different.’ But not shocking,” Barton said. “Just keep it intriguing.”
Meddlesome Brewing Co.
7750 Trinity Rd., suite 114
Wed.-Fri.: 4-10 p.m. Sat.: Noon-10 p.m. Sun.: Noon-7 p.m.
The newest edition to the Memphis craft beer scene, and the farthest east, Meddlesome Brewing Co. opened its doors June 30.
Ben Pugh, co-owner of Meddlesome Brewing, described the Memphis beer scene as a growing industry that will only get better.
“It was one of the last places to come on the map as far as beer goes, and it has taken a little bit to pick up some momentum,” Pugh said. “But, now it seems to be going pretty well.”
Food trucks are on-site, and the owners plan to build a patio. The 5,000-square-foot brewery does not have a separate space for private events, but the 1,200-square-foot taproom is available for rentals. Pugh said they started to receive rental requests before it even opened.
In proximity to Shelby Farms Park and the Greenline, Pugh and co-owner Richie EsQuivel — who have many years of experience in the homebrewer and commercial sectors — told MBJ in 2016 that it would be crazy not to be in that area.
It’s even more crazy with the Park’s Edge at Shelby Farms apartments across the street from Meddlesome, and with the $200 million-dollar mixed-use Parkside at Shelby Farms, proposed for a 55-acre site at Whitten Road and Mullins Station. Parkside calls for everything from a boutique hotel to apartments, restaurants, retail, office space and senior living.
As for the brewery’s name, it’s all about quality. EsQuivel said they have always “meddled with convention” to produce a better product.
Crosstown Brewing Co.
1264 Concourse Ave.
Hours: TBD
With construction underway, Crosstown Brewing Co. hopes to have its first official beer brewed by October. The 2,800-square-foot taproom is expected to follow in December. Taproom hours and rental options are still in the planning phases.
Clark Ortkiese, brewery co-founder with Will Goodwin, said the taproom is “vital” to their plans.
“Especially being where we are at the Concourse,” Ortkiese said. “One of our favorite things about being down there is being able to work with our neighbors, such as Church Health, Memphis Teacher Residency, Crosstown Arts, St. Jude. … We placed a huge level of importance on that, so we could have [somewhere] we could spend time with them.”
The brewery will be a new-build located on the property of the mammoth vertical-urban village known as Crosstown Concourse — the $200 million, reimagined Sears building rooted in arts, education and health.
While some tenants, both residential and commercial, have already moved into Crosstown Concourse, the official grand opening celebration for the 1.1 million-square-foot building is scheduled for Aug. 19.
Ortkiese said the brewery anticipates having 10 employees once operational. And, despite the fact the brewery isn’t built, Ortkiese said they are “insistently” contacted about rentals.
Ortkiese described the current beer sector in Memphis as fantastic.
“It is going forward really quickly, and we are excited to be part of it,” Ortkiese said. “It is a good time for beer in Memphis.”
