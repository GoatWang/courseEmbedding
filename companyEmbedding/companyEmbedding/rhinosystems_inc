Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Overview


Naväge is a nose cleaner with gentle powered suction.  Unlike neti pots and squeeze bottles that push saline through your nose, Naväge gently pulls. Naväge is completely self-contained so you can use it fully clothed without making a mess. Naväge takes the "Yuck" and "Yikes" out of nasal rinsing.  
The Naväge Nose Cleaner operates with genuine Naväge SaltPod capsules to provide a soothing, refreshing, perfectly-balanced saline rinse every time. Our patented system eliminates the measuring and the mess.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        RhinoSystems, Inc has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        RhinoSystems, Inc has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Everybody Loves Naväge!









Relieves my allergies!
"Used to do nasal cleaning with a neti pot, just thought it was bit messy. I bought this to give a try and Im glad I did. I have bad allergies and have taken tons of medicine when they break out. Since I started using this I have had no allergy problems, breathing is easier and I sleep better at night."  Larry W.







Everything about my breathing has improved...
"For the first time in twenty years, I have not suffered through a multi-week, winter sinus infection. The difference is using Navage every day for the past six months. Everything about my breathing has improved over time. Get into the habit of daily Navage and dont look back!" 
 Rachel C.







No more snoring!!
"I cant tell you enough how amazing this product is. The effects are immediate and long lasting. I use it twice a day and no more antihistamines, no more sinus pills, and no more snoring!! Are you kidding me? Get the Navage. You wont be sorry." 
 Michael T.







No more allergy pills...
"I have had allergies and sinus problems all my life and never found a way to beat them until now, I have gotten rid of all spring and summer stuffed noses and sinus infections since I have started using the Navage, no more allergy pills or anything." 
 Mary H.

Doctors Love Nasal Irrigation


Nasal irrigation is a simple, inexpensive treatment that relieves the symptoms of a variety of sinus conditions, reduces use of medical resources, and could help minimize antibiotic resistance.

Blake Papsin, M.D.

Nasal irrigation is clinically proven to relieve sinus congestion safely and effectively without drugs. Naväge sets the new standard for personal nasal care with its exceptional convenience, consistency, and ease of use.

Performers Love Naväge!





 


Raymond Aceto
International Opera Star
Using Naväge is an awesome experience. Even non-opera singers will find relief from allergens and dust and whatever is bothering them. Singers are 1000% more sensitive about everything going on in our head, sinuses, and throat. Naväge is going to be a revelation for us. I use it every day.







Ruthie Ann Miles
Tony Award Winner and Broadway Star
I discovered Naväge when I was experiencing terrible allergies.  When post nasal drip gets onto your vocal chords, you worry about hitting your notes.  I went to the doctor, but he said antibiotics wouldnt help because it was allergies.  I tried Naväge as soon as it arrived and got results within 36 hours. Now I swear by it!








Marcus Nance
Actor / Singer
I love, love, love my Naväge!  It feels like a nasal massage.  Not only does it clear me out so that I can breathe deeper, but amazingly, it also seems to relax the muscles around my sinuses. Very, very cool!  This is SO important for singers. Im going to keep sharing my experience with friends in theatre and opera.  Thanks so much!








Corey Crider
Actor / Singer
While in Montana, I woke up with a sore throat and post-nasal irritation, and was almost certain I was doomed to a full-blown respiratory malady setting in and wreaking its havoc. I doubled up on the Naväge, and after 3 days, it had passed without further development. Hurray, Naväge!








John Arias
Professional Cyclist
Before using Naväge I had 3 nose surgeries with no improvement. Being a pro athlete and not being able to breathe through my nose is a huge problem for my cycling. I was worried that if I couldnt find help, Id have to give it up.  But after just a few days of using Naväge, I can breathe through my nose again!
