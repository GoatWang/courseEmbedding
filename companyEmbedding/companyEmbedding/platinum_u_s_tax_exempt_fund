Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops.
 
Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss. Diversification among investment options and asset classes may help to reduce overall volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

Your clients are living longer, and many of them haven't saved enough. Use our Principles for Successful Long-Term Investing to talk to them about this reality, and to help them be prepared.
ACCESS ALL 7 PRINCIPLES







 














We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

Studies reveal that individuals do not feel adequately prepared for retirement. Investors should start early by saving more, investing with discipline and having a plan for their future.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Information is updated every day at approximately 6P CST. The Last Price, Change, and Change Percent is listed at the top, with other quote data listed in the quoteboard below.  Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity. YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."                                  Add Data Columns to this Table Learn about our Custom Views   Want to use this as  your default charts setting?

Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops.
 
Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss. Diversification among investment options and asset classes may help to reduce overall volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential

Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2

Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3

1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
