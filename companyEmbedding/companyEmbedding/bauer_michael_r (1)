Petition ClosedPetitioning Eddie Bauer Holdings, Inc CEO Michael R. EgeckDecision makersCEO Michael R. EgeckEddie Bauer Holdings, IncPetition Eddie Bauer to stop using all down in their productsJacqueline Harger Chickasha, OKJacqueline HargerChickasha, OK2,371SupportersThe popular clothing company Eddie Bauer uses down in their products. For those not familiar with the process of obtaining down, it is quite barbaric. Eddie Bauer has been linked to farms that claim to only use the down that is plucked post-mortem. A PETA investigation was conducted and bald birds were found on site as well as people who admitted that they do use live-plucking procedures and pass off the down as responsibly sourced down. For those not familiar with the process of live-plucking, this is what it entails; Birds are held belly-up between workers legs, and the down is quickly and painfully ripped out.  These birds struggle to free themselves from the torture sometimes resulting in broken limbs. After the down is ripped from the birds bodies, the birds can be paralyzed and many end up having large wounds. These wounds are then sewn up by workers with needled and thread and no anesthetic. Then the birds grow back their down and the violent procedure is repeated for the rest of the birds life.
A representative for Eddie Bauer made a statement saying that their down is sourced from one supplier, Allied Feather and Down. This supplier stated their down does not come from any of the factories that PETA mentioned. However Allied Feather and Down is the middle man, so they cannot say with 100% certainty that the down is cruelty-free because they are not there are many of these farms that hide the true source of the down being obtained by the suppliers who then sell the down to Companies such as Eddie Bauer.
With all of this said, the only way to be sure that the down is cruelty free is to abstain from using it at all. So, take a stand for these birds that are being cruelly tortured and demand Eddie Bauer quit using down in all of its products no matter the source.This petition was delivered to:Eddie Bauer Holdings, IncCEO Michael R.

STATE OF WISCONSIN����������������������� IN COURT OF APPEALS

 

 
State
of Wisconsin, 
 
����������������������������
Plaintiff-Respondent,
 
������������� v.
 
Michael
R. Bauer, 
 
����������������������������
Defendant-Appellant.
 

 

����������������������� APPEAL
from a judgment of the circuit court for Waukesha County:� Joseph
e. wimmer, Judge.� Affirmed.� 
����������������������� Before
Brown, P.J., Nettesheim and Anderson, JJ.�

����������� �1����������� BROWN, P.J.�
Michael R. Bauer was charged with attempted first-degree intentional
homicide of his wife and attempted possession of an electric weapon.� While in jail awaiting trial, he solicited
the murder of his wife and a friend who were going to testify against him.� During Bauer�s trial, the judge allowed
testimony regarding Bauer�s attempted solicitation.�� The issue in this case is how the solicitation evidence should
be categorized and whether it is admissible.
�2����������� Bauer argues that the solicitation evidence was other
acts evidence which was improperly admitted pursuant to Wis. Stat. � 904.04(2) (1997-98).[1]� The State responds that the evidence was not
other acts evidence, but rather was evidence of consciousness of guilt, which
was properly admitted.� Alternatively,
the State argues that even if it was other acts evidence, it was properly
admitted because it was offered to prove intent.� The trial court held that the evidence was other acts evidence
which was admissible because it was offered to prove intent or motive.� We agree with the trial court that this
evidence was admissible, but not because it was other acts evidence.� Rather, it was admissible because it was
evidence of a criminal act of the accused intended to obstruct justice or avoid
punishment which can be used to prove consciousness of guilt. 
����������� �3����������� We will relate the facts in a light most favorable to the
jury verdict.� See Management
Computer Servs. v. Hawkins, Ash, Baptie & Co., 206 Wis. 2d 158,
192, 557 N.W.2d 67 (1996).�� Bauer
planned to electrocute his wife while she was sleeping on April 23, 1997, by
placing her hands in handcuffs that were hidden above and behind her bed and
were wired to carry an electrical current when activated.� However, each of the three times he entered
her bedroom to commit the crime, she woke up.�
The next day, Bauer ordered an electric weapon to assist him in killing
his wife.� A few days later, Bauer�s
wife discovered the handcuff device, informed the police and Bauer was
subsequently charged with the crimes listed above. 
��4����������� At trial, Bauer�s cell mate testified that in July 1997,
while Bauer was in jail awaiting trial, Bauer told him that he wanted to hire
someone to kill his wife so that she could not testify against him.�� Bauer also told his cell mate that he
wanted someone to kill a friend of his who was going to testify against
him.� The cell mate informed the police
of Bauer�s plan.� A police officer
posing as an assassin met with Bauer on two occasions.� Bauer attempted to hire the officer to kill
his wife, his friend and any witnesses, including children, who might be
nearby, gangster style.
�5����������� The trial court may admit or exclude evidence within its
discretion.� See State v.
Hereford, 195 Wis. 2d 1054, 1065, 537 N.W.2d 62 (Ct. App. 1995).� Even if the trial court applies a mistaken
view of the law, we will not reverse if a proper legal analysis supports the
trial court�s conclusion.� See id.

�6����������� The categorization and admissibility of the evidence in
this case is controlled by State v. Neuser, 191 Wis. 2d 131, 144,
528 N.W.2d 49 (Ct. App. 1995).� In that
case, shortly before trial, Neuser, who was accused of stabbing his girlfriend,
called and threatened her.� Neuser argued
that evidence of this threat was inadmissible other acts evidence.� But the Neuser court held that
the evidence was not other acts.� See
id.� �Rather, it was
admissible evidence of Neuser�s consciousness of guilt.� It is generally acknowledged that evidence
of criminal acts of an accused which are intended to obstruct justice or avoid
punishment are admissible to prove a consciousness of guilt of the principal
criminal charge.�� Id. (citation
omitted).
�7����������� Similarly, in this case, Bauer�s attempt to solicit
murder was intended to �obstruct justice [and] avoid punishment� and could be
used to prove �consciousness of guilt.� Bauer�s solicitation of murder, which
is much more extreme than Neuser�s vague threats, indicates that like Neuser,
Bauer was conscious of his guilt and probably suspected that both his wife and
friend could provide compelling testimony as to his guilt.� Because Bauer�s attempt to solicit murder
was a criminal act intended to obstruct justice and avoid punishment which
demonstrates consciousness of guilt, pursuant to Neuser, evidence
related to it is not other acts evidence and is admissible.[2]
�8����������� By holding that the evidence in question is not other
acts evidence and that it was properly admitted, we need not address Bauer�s
other three arguments.� These arguments
include that:� the jury was improperly
instructed regarding how to consider the evidence, Bauer�s trial counsel was
ineffective for failing to propose an adequate cautionary instruction regarding
the other acts evidence and without the other acts evidence, the guilty verdict
cannot be sustained.
By the Court.�Judgment
affirmed. 




 




[1] All
references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 1997-98 version.


[2]� We have noticed a trend in criminal cases
where the State and the defense, and sometimes the trial courts, are quick to
classify evidence as �other acts� evidence.�
Based on this supposition, the issue becomes whether the act fits or
fails to fit within the criteria for admissibility pursuant to Wis. Stat. � 904.04(2).� However, the trial bar and bench should note
that simply because an act can be factually classified as �different��in time,
place and, perhaps, manner than the act complained of�that different act is not
necessarily �other acts� evidence in the eyes of the law.� 
For example, in State v. Johnson, 184
Wis. 2d 324, 516 N.W.2d 463 (Ct. App. 1994) (Anderson, J., concurring), the
State accused Johnson of battery and reckless endangerment of his former
live-in girlfriend.� Johnson tried to
offer evidence to show that the former girlfriend fabricated the incident in
order to misappropriate Johnson�s possessions.�
Although we addressed the issue under the guise of an �other acts�
analysis, we questioned whether evidence of the former girlfriend�s acts of
attempted misappropriation were properly considered other acts evidence because
the evidence involved the same actors as the incident and went directly to
Johnson�s defense.� See id.
at 338-39.� And Judge Anderson,
concurring, was even more emphatic.� He
wrote that the evidence was not �other acts� evidence and that a
�frame-by-frame� view of evidence was an inappropriate way to determine whether
an �other acts� analysis is an order.� See
id. at 350.��� 
Similarly in this case, even though the attempted
murder occurred on April 23, 1997, and the solicitation for murder did not
occur during the same time and at the same place, evidence of the solicitation
is not considered other acts evidence.�
While the solicitation evidence undoubtedly is a �different� act than
the attempted murder charge that was before the jury, the State did not seek to
admit this �different� evidence to show a�
similarity between the other act and the charged� offense.�
Rather, the State sought to introduce the solicitation evidence to show
Bauer�s critical awareness, interest and concern about his guilt to the very
charge before the jury.� When the State
or the defense offers a �different� act to show a similarity between that other
act and the act complained of, then it is properly termed �other acts evidence�
and the court should proceed pursuant to Wis.
Stat. � 904.04(2).� See
State v. Sullivan, 216 Wis. 2d 768, 786-87, 576 N.W.2d 30
(1998).� But the first question the
lawyers and the trial court should ask is �what is the purpose of the State�s
intention to admit the evidence?�� If it
is not to show a similarity between the other act and the alleged act, then
perhaps the parties should entertain the question of whether it is �other acts�
evidence at all.
