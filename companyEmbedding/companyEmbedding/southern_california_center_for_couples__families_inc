BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES 
WE ALL NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO
Seeking therapy is a very powerful, first-step to overcoming life’s challenges. Therapy offers a safe space for you to be open and share your troubles
without judgement. Marriage and Family Therapists are trained in a wide variety
of specializations and will listen and work with you to overcome the obstacle
in your life.
Whether you are here to find help to a more fulfilled and happier you, or
helping a loved one move through a difficult chapter in life, Counseling California’s
online directory is home to thousands of qualified therapists who are eager
to help you take the next step on your journey. Real therapy. Right here. Right
now.
Mental Health Matters



























Finding a Way to Cope
Stress, anxiety, depression, panic disorder and other behavioral health issues are difficult to manage without making lifestyle changes. And they are not uncommon. According to the American Psychological Association’s stress survey, 66 percent of people regularly feel the physical effects of stress and 63 percent experience psychological symptoms. Women are twice as likely as men to develop certain mental health conditions like depression, eating disorders and panic disorders.  READ MORE



























Surviving a Traumatic Experience
Trauma is an event that elicits a strong emotional response to the experience,
such as an accident, assault, natural disaster, violence or long-term abuse.
It can leave you feeling shocked, overwhelmed, disoriented and hopeless. It is
estimated that up to 70 percent of adults have been affected by a traumatic event
at some point in their lives. Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTS) can help
you manage your feelings and cope with behaviors following a traumatic event.  READ MORE



























Getting the Help you Need for Addictions
People turn to substances and/or behaviors to escape or distract themselves from pain.  Not all of these are unhealthy or problematic but when they get in the way of relationships, work or enjoyment in life, they can become increasingly distressing. Substance addictions occur when the amount of use has created a tolerance to the substance and more of the drug is needed for the same high.  Addictions also create a physiological withdrawal from the substance when not using it. READ MORE

Saddle up for a Southwest family tradition at Rankin Ranch! This working ranch has been welcoming cowboys and cowgirls of all ages for more than a hundred years. Gallop across the lush valleys and mountainous trails on a horseback riding adventure, hike or bike through the green meadows, and hook your share of rainbow trout on Lake Julia. Onsite fun is also at a premium, as you can make a splash at the outdoor heated pool, shoot some billiards in the game room, or serve up a game of volleyball. The little ranchers will love the children's program, which features hayrides, arts and crafts, and animal interaction at Sarah's farm. After a fun-filled day, return to your rustic yet refined cabin, which features breathtaking views of Walker's Basin and a soothing hot tub!

Don’t feel like using the kitchen? Head down to the onsite Riverside Restaurant for a catch-of-the-day dinner and a glass of Chardonnay at the bar. Plan your fishy Ballard’s Resort stay, today!
