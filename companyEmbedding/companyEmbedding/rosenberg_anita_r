Bali is one of the most magical places I have been because they live every day in a spiritual way. This photo of a Buddha fountain not only brings good Feng Shui, but creates a serene vibe to any space. Buddha brings serenity to any space, plus he makes you feel good. Even a Buddha photo is powerful.
