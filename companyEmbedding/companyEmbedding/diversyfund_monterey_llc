DiversyFund, Inc., a Leading Online Crowdfunding Real Estate Investment Company in San Diego, Brings New Innovations to Real Estate Crowdfunding


Press Release
-


									updated: May 17, 2017							

 





			San Diego, CA, 
			May 17, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	On August 18, 2016, Craig Cecilio and Alan Lewis partnered together to co-found DiversyFund, Inc., based in San Diego, California. Mr. Cecilio and Mr. Lewis formed DiversyFund, Inc. to create the industry’s first online crowdfunding real estate platform where the company acts as the real estate developer on all of its investment offerings in order to deliver to its investors better quality control and more detailed and robust investor reporting, including monthly construction updates on each real estate project with pictures of all work in progress. 
This unique business model creates better-aligned incentives with the Company’s investors since the Company does not receive any profit from the sale of a real estate project until after it pays back its investors their full agreed upon return. Because DiversyFund, Inc. acts as the developer and receives a developer fee that is paid at the project level, DiversyFund does not charge any platform fees, servicing fees or other sales commissions to its investors, enabling investors to keep 100% of their investment returns.  “One of the big attractions and innovations of the crowdfunding industry is its ability to reduce transaction fees charged to investors by cutting out the middlemen. We decided to take this innovation one step further than our competitors. Instead of reduced platforms fees, we have no platform fees and the investment community has taken notice,” said Craig Cecilio, CEO and Founder of DiversyFund, Inc.
Additionally, DiversyFund, Inc. is the only crowdfunding real estate site that focuses exclusively on strong-performing Southern California real estate markets. 
As of May 2017, DiversyFund, Inc. currently has five luxury single-family residential projects in construction and just launched its first commercial real estate offering for investors. The commercial offering is a mixed-use development in San Diego’s trendy Hillcrest neighborhood north of Balboa Park.  DiversyFund will be building 58 multifamily units with 5,000 SF of ground floor commercial space. DiversyFund also recently announced a partnership with Roman James Design Build, the top luxury design-build firm in Beverly Hills. Roman James is the design-builder on DiversyFund’s spectacular 7,200 SF luxury residential project in La Jolla. The La Jolla project will feature stunning ocean views from every room on the property. 
“We have been very disciplined in our selection and curation of real estate investment opportunities, ensuring that our investors have a balanced mix of luxury residential and commercial real estate projects with various investment structures to choose from.  Our investment products include both passive income offerings for our commercial real estate and growth opportunities for our luxury residential product,” said Alan Lewis, Chief Investment Officer and Co-Founder.
The newly-formed DiversyFund, Inc. purchased the DiversyFund.com domain name and related crowdfunding website from Coastal California Funding Group, Inc., dba CCFG Investments, last year, allowing the newly formed DiversyFund, Inc. to continue the success of the DiversyFund.com crowdfunding platform that was previously launched by CCFG Investments in 2014.
CCFG Investments was founded by Craig Cecilio, one of DiversyFund, Inc.’s founders, in 2005 and functioned for nearly 12 years as a successful loan origination and loan servicing company. 
After the sale of the DiversyFund.com domain name to DiversyFund, Inc., CCFG Investments shut down its loan servicing operations and officially dissolved in March 2017 so that Mr. Cecilio could devote 100% of his time to the new DiversyFund, Inc. real estate development business that he and Mr. Lewis started in August 2016. The three remaining CCFG Investments loans were transferred to Halo Management Group for loan servicing.
CCFG Investments raised debt capital for third-party real estate developers building and renovating single-family residential throughout Southern and Northern California. In February 2014, CCFG Investments purchased the domain name, www.DiversyFund.com, and launched a real estate crowdfunding website so that investors from across the U.S. could invest in CCFG Investments’ various real estate debt investments. CCFG Investments originated over $100 million of real estate debt investments just in the last few years alone.
About DiversyFundDiversyFund, Inc. is an online crowdfunding real estate investment platform. The company connects accredited investors from across the U.S. to high-quality real estate investment opportunities, focusing on Southern California’s strongest-performing real estate markets such as Orange County, San Diego and Los Angeles. DiversyFund is unique in that it acts as the real estate developer for all of its investment offerings, giving investors increased quality control, more accurate reporting and transparency compared to other crowdfunding sites that simply raise capital for other third party real estate developers.  DiversyFund’s principals share over four decades of combined experience in the real estate investment community, bringing together real estate expertise and Wall Street experience to the online crowdfunding space.  The company is focused on changing the world of real estate investing and is dedicated to providing investors with diversification via high-quality and thoroughly-vetted investment opportunities.

DiversyFund Announces New Luxury Investment With Roman James Design Build

							DiversyFund and Roman James Design Build Partner Up to Bring an Exclusive and Ultra Modern Hollywood Hills, California Luxury Home Investment Opportunity.						


Press Release
-


									updated: Jun 13, 2017							

 





			San Diego, CA, 
			June 13, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	DiversyFund, Inc., a fast-growing full-service online real estate investment platform, announced the next ground-breaking real estate investment project that their partnership with Roman James Design Build will undertake. DiversyFund and Roman James will be building a new ultra-luxury in Hollywood Hills, one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
This investment opportunity is located at the end of Granito Drive in the prestigious Hollywood Hills community of Los Angeles, California, home to Hollywood celebrities, professional athletes and Fortune 500 CEOs. The property is located high up on a coveted promontory lot that provides breathtaking 180-degree views of downtown Los Angeles and the Santa Monica Mountains. This investment opportunity will feature a stunning 14,350 square foot single family house designed by renowned architect and builder Roman James, who designed the record-setting Beverly Hills home purchased by the creator of Minecraft for $70 million.
This new Granito Drive investment opportunity in Hollywood Hills is one of the most anticipated designs by Roman James given its sought-after location. It’s expected to be another record-setting masterpiece just like Hillcrest and Roman’s previous home builds.  
DiversyFund’s and Roman James’ previous investment offering on the Costebelle, La Jolla, California investment opportunity was fulfilled by investors in a record three days. “Our investors are looking for growth investment opportunities where we can target attractive equity returns and still give them priority protection similar to a debt product. Our new Granito investment delivers on both fronts and we expect that the investment will fill up quickly,” said Craig Cecilio, CEO and founder of DiversyFund.
“Our Granito project with Roman James gives investors from across the country the chance to both diversify their portfolios into multimillion dollar real estate but they also get to own a piece of one of LA’s most anticipated real estate projects that has a construction budget of over $20 million and based on Roman’s impressive track record, will easily sell to a celebrity buyer for over double that amount,” said Alan Lewis, Chief Investment Officer and co-founder of DiversyFund.
Currently, the Granito Drive opportunity is fully entitled and awaiting the building permit final approval. DiversyFund and Roman James expect to start construction in the next 60 days. The investment opportunity will be targeting an 18% annualized return to investors.
About DiversyFundDiversyFund is a modern full-service online crowdfunding real estate investment platform. The Company connects accredited investors to some of the most attractive real estate investment opportunities in the nation. The Company’s principals, Craig Cecilio and Alan Lewis, combine nearly four decades of collective experience in the real estate investment industry bringing the best of both real estate expertise and Wall Street experience to the company’s investors. DiversyFund is focused on changing the world of real estate investing and is dedicated to providing investors with diversification via high-quality and thoroughly-vetted alternative investment opportunities in both commercial and luxury single-family real estate. Unlike other real estate crowdfunding platforms, DiversyFund performs all of its own development in-house and owns its own construction division, providing its investors with greater quality control and transparency on investor reporting and allowing DiversyFund to offer a unique, zero platform fee experience to investors.

DiversyFund Users Fund Mavrix Group’s $3.1 Million Equity Investment Offering For La Jolla Property
 Tweet13 Share Share +1 Reddit Pin EmailShares 13

February 18, 2015 @ 1:16 pm By Samantha Hurst 





DiversyFund, a real estate crowdfunding platform that connects accredited investors to high-quality pre-vetted real estate investment opportunities, announced its most recent funding of an equity investment offering for a single family residence located in the heart of La Jolla, California. The Operator, Mavrix Group, is a privately held real estate development firm that specializes in investments and the transformation of properties.



Founder and CEO of DiversyFund, Craig Cecilio stated, “Erin Wicomb and Joseph Ferrigno, visionaries of The Mavrix Group, have successfully flipped over 50 high luxury properties since inception and manage real estate holdings that are valued over $10MM. We are excited to be partnering with this team and taking part in this investment opportunity. The property is located in a strong economic market that has shown decades of sustainable growth. It’s a slam dunk.”



Through DiversyFund’s crowdfunding platform, The Mavrix Group was able to raise $1.055 million to renovate a 6 bed / 7.5 bath property that sits on a 20,495 Sq ft. lot in La Jolla, CA. Investors will receive a preferred return and a percentage of the profits expected to exceed 20%.
The Mavrix Group has been a long time referral partner of DiversyFund’s parent company, CCFG Investments. After over a decade of experience in real estate investing, CCFG launched DiversyFund in January of 2014 with the vision to create an easier process for current accredited investors to review live investment offerings as well as tap into new individual and institutional investors looking to invest in high-quality real estate investments.
