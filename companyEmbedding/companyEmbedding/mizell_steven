Throughout our lives each of us experience setbacks and moments of failure. It is one of the things that many of us have in common.

Our Greatest Struggle

I think every couple or family has specific issues that are a source of contention or pain. Although the exact issue may be different for each of us, everyone has a constant issue that creeps up over and over again. For some it is finances or a lack of communication. For others it is career…  Read more »

Detours Delay but they Do Not Deter

 

Recently, our family spent the weekend celebrating our son Cameron’s graduation from Liberty University. It was a fun weekend filled with a lot of excitement. Parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins and friends gathered to celebrate a milestone in Cameron’s life. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, honored the 2017 class at Liberty by giving…  Read more »

Working to Rest

 

The number of Americans who live paycheck-to-paycheck is growing every year. Some of this can be contributed to wage or job growth suppression or cost of living outpacing income. Much of it, however, is because we live beyond our means in the land of wants versus needs. We encumber ourselves with unnecessary debt to have…  Read more »

Distractions are dangerous

 

I tend to get distracted easily. Some people call it ADD or ADHD. It’s possible that would be the correct diagnosis. There are some things that can keep my attention more than others. Certain types of conversations draw me in because I enjoy the topic or the debate. I find it easy to stay engaged…  Read more »

4 practices to create fairness

 

Recently, I have been intrigued by three words in Proverbs. The specific proverb reads “Then you will understand what is right, just and fair” (Proverbs 2:9 NLT). Our morality can probably be boiled down to these three things: what is right, what is just and what is fair. Right is the ability to know the…  Read more »

Fear is Poison to Love

 

There is a book in the Bible with a chapter that is referred to as “The Love Chapter”, 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. This chapter offers some qualities that love should display.

3 myths of discipline

 

Discipline is not a word that generally brings joy to a room or a smile to a face. No matter the context, discipline is rarely received warmly. “Discipline” can refer to a corrective measure or to training yourself in a controlled or habitual way. It is teaching someone do the right thing or it is…  Read more »

Words Every Family Needs

 

Words play an important role in every family. Marriages begin with “I love you” and vows that include “I do” or “I will”. Children are born and we quickly learn the art of baby talk. We anxiously await the first words of our children. Words are a part of the fabric of every family.  …  Read more »

4 Things That Shape Our Lives

 

Earlier I shared about the value of correction and instruction and how our lives are shaped by the things that we do and the people who influence us. Proverbs 1:8 in the NLT says “My child, listen when your father corrects you. Don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.” Correction and instruction don’t stop once we become…  Read more »

Correction and Instruction

 

Recently I have spent some time pondering a verse from the book of Proverbs. Proverbs 1:8 in the NLT says “My child, listen when your father corrects you. Don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.” It is speaking to the importance of parenting and instilling specific values into our children. Most people understand that parents play a…  Read more »
