Validian Protect





 
Validian - Technology
Validian's core technology, ValidianProtect, is application and data protection middleware that integrates rapidly into existing or new applications to seal off the application and its information from threats posed by malicious parties. Many different types of applications can be protected or existing applications extended; from legacy client/server applications, to fully distributed business and industrial applications, to more modern web, mobile and Cloud applications, easily and intuitively. 
These applications can then be deployed on either a hosted, on-premises or cloud basis with the level of protection controlled dynamically by administrators.
The ValidianProtect product line consists of:

the Application & Data Protection Platform that protects against network-borne vulnerabilities such as intrusion, impersonation and interception by creating a series of virtual closed systems called "Realms", which encompass and seamlessly protect the application and the complete life cycle of data with secure access, retrieval, transfer, receipt, storage and usage of digital information on all devices, operating systems and technology platforms regardless of any type of cyber attack or vulnerability or if the host device or network has been hacked or improperly accessed, infected with viruses or malware, or otherwise compromised. 
the Data Protection Module that protects against host-borne vulnerabilities such as memory-scanning and file system scanning as well as provides a set of ready built common features, such as data transfer, file transfer, instant messaging and large message transfer capability and support, plus a set of first-to-market features for handling data, which provide significant differentiating features and enhanced competitive advantages, including:

the ability of a sender to control the usage and to prevent the misuse of data by a recipient, including reading, storing, copying, editing, forwarding and exporting the data - or to prevent each, any or all of these 
the ability of the sender to remotely retract data already sent to a recipient 
a number of automatic and immediate alerts to the sender for each of the uses and attempted misuses of data by the recipient          



a set of programming tools and SDKs that facilitate rapid integration of the platform and module within the target application

You are right. The product is not plug and play like Bruce has represented.  The fact is Ganthet is not able to get their messaging app to work with the new Apple operating system and Validian Protect. I believe that is why we have not seen any activity from them. If Ganthet can not get it to work Bruce has no vehicle to use to show others it works.

Quote:NO ONE HAS SEEN THE PRODUCT EXCEPT VIA SAIC (WAS EXPOSED)  NO ONE HAS TALKED TO ANY VLDI SALES OR TECHNICAL STAFFS  NO 3RD PARTY COMMUNITY IS AWARE OF VLDI  RUN AND DESIGNED BY WASHED UP CFO  NO FACILITY TO GO TO  3RD RATED WEB SITE WITH CRAP DOCUMENTS  RECYCLED PRS  NO ANDROID OR IOS COMMUNITY APPROVAL  NO COMPANY MENTIONING VLDI   And Yet   PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MILLION END POINTS  SOME COMPANY IN STEALTH INTEGRATING VLDI  WASHEDUP CFO BB HAS DESIGNED NEXT CYBER CROWN JEWEL   Well, actually I have three associates who have seen, tested, and confirmed that VP works.   And two of them have had indirect contact with the sales and technical staff   And a 3rd party has tested and verified every keystroke of the code, and it passed with flying colors   And VP was ACTUALLY designed and perfected using some of the best software designers in the world, people who are currently being used by MSFT, Apple, Google, Android, Blackberry, SAP, and others. BB has been the guiding force behind their efforts, and his concepts have actually changed the way some of the largest software developers in the world are now writing their apps   They have SEVERAL facilities to go to depending upon the need, but NO walk-in office for people to sneak around trying to find out their secrets, abuse their employees, and generally get in the way.  Besides, none of the things anyone would want to see are sitting around on the desks waiting for someone to steal them so it is a non-issue.  The actual software is under some of the tightest security measures I have ever heard of, and for good reason.  The VP app is trying to stop some of the most dangerous criminal activities in the history of man. Activities that can literally destroy nations.  so no RATIONAL person would ever think that such information should be made available to anyone who shows up at the door.   The current website was designed a decade ago and has ZERO to do with the company's progress or their marketing efforts at this time since all prospects are given a comprehensive data and marketing pack tailored to their specific situation.  The new modern interactive site is being designed and will be uploaded the second it is actually needed.   No doubt about it, some of the PRs have been redundant.  As Bruce has been bombarded by shareholders for information he has done less than a perfect job of keeping us informed about new things that can support the price.  I have told him that in nearly every conversation.  And he has made some significant effort to correct that, as we have seen in the last four PRs.   As for Android, iOS and company announcements, I have no doubt that they are coming.   TPP
