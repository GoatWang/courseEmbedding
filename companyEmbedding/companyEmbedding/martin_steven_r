Background & Education
Research  Courses Taught Graduate Students




 What I like about HSU is the sense of community and shared ideals and the feeling that people are here because they want to make things better . . . the environment, their communities. When I teach a class it’s my favorite part of the day. I look forward to going into the classroom because I enjoy having that discussion, that intellectual give and take, about a topic in which we all share an interest.
My teaching and professional interests include park and wilderness planning and management, particularly planning for and managing recreational uses of parks, wilderness, and similar public lands. My personal interests and hobbies include whitewater kayaking and rafting, hiking and backpacking, cross-country skiing, and visiting our great public lands. My favorite landscapes to visit are the Colorado Plateau deserts of southern Utah and the high mountain lakes and forests of western Montana and the high Sierra. The two books that have most influenced me are A Sand County Almanac, by Aldo Leopold, and Desert Solitaire, by Edward Abbey. Contact Information

Research 

Dr. Martin is the 2015 recipient of the national award for Excellence in Wilderness Stewardship Research, awarded by the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. 
My research focuses on visitor use of recreation settings and managing recreational use of natural resource areas, particularly parks, wilderness areas and similar public lands. 
Much of my research involves recreation visitor studies which aim to increase our understanding of: 

the nature of the outdoor recreation experience
problems that detract from recreation visitor enjoyment
how to enhance the experience of recreation visitors
how recreational activities may impact resources
how to minimize the impacts of recreation
issues of visitor access to areas, and how to balance an area’s recreational use with protection of its resources
the direct and indirect techniques used to manage recreation visitors
the factors that influence people's participation in outdoor recreation
changing recreation use patterns and trends


As such, my research is best characterized as “human dimensions of natural resources” and involves quite a bit of social science, though in a natural resources context.

 I'm interested in determining effective management in restoring tribal values for tule (Shoenoplectus) baskets in Yosemite National Park. I want to compare burned and non-burned sites for tule growth, quality and size. Can cutting, tearing tule at different intensities and seasons be an effective management tool to promote growth for cultural purposes? What are the pests or pathogens that attack tules and can prescribed burning be an effective biological control? I will examine historical documents in regards to marsh and riparian burns, as well as interview basket weavers and elders about the qualities, gathering and management techniques of tule for good basket material and other utilitarian purposes and then try to meet those values by implementing a management regime for restoring plants important for cultural preservation.

 Measuring Recreation Use Impacts on Old-Growth Redwoods   Old-growth coastal redwood stands and the habitat they provide are the conservation target of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in northern California. In recent years there has been greater access to location information about record-sized trees, and visitors have created networks of social trails in redwood groves, including one grove that has no formal access. Coupled with increasing visitor numbers, this has caused an alarming increase in recreational impacts in redwood groves. By providing visitors access to groves, managers accept that there will be ecosystem impacts, but data is needed to evaluate the degree of impact on trees, soil and understory vegetation. I assessed impacts of social trails around old-growth redwood trees in three alluvial flat groves with different use intensities in RNSP. In 2015 I mapped old-growth redwood trees and social trail networks around these trees. I randomly sampled 20 to 30 trees per site and collected baseline data on the spatial extent of disturbance and selected vegetation and soil indicators. Tree size (measured as diameter) proved to be significantly positively related with trampling disturbance around trees in two of the sites, while in the highest-use site, distance from the formal trail was most strongly related with disturbed area. The findings of this study will serve as initial baseline conditions for recreational impacts in these stands. RNSP can use the study design developed for this thesis to monitor changes in trail-related visitor impacts in old-growth redwood stands of management concern.

 Does personal information and communication technology in the wilderness lead to more risk-taking in wilderness?   Through a wilderness visitor survey in Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness (n= 635) and follow-up personal phone interviews (n=65), this study offers insight in how personal locator beacon (PLBs) technology may influence wilderness visitors. Results show that wilderness visitors were able to enjoy the wilderness experience more worry-free and guilt-free than they had without a device. Many said that it was an added precautionary tool, such as a first aid kit, flare gun or whistle, making them more prepared in the case of an emergency. We also found that carrying a device helped wilderness visitors travel without feeling guilty for causing their loved ones back home to worry about their safety. Solo travelers in particular were able to enjoy the solitude of their wilderness experience more than they would have without a device. The only significant finding on how a device may influence risk-taking or decision making in the wilderness, was on the visitors’ decision to travel alone. Many people felt they would be more likely to travel alone if they had a personal locator device. The device theoretically would replace the need for traveling in a group. Those that consider themselves to be risk takers said they would be just as likely to do the same activities with or without the device. Hand-held technology, by influencing the wilderness experience and risk behavior of the wilderness visitor, will lead to inevitable changes in what defines wilderness (solitude, sense of self-reliance, primitive experience, meeting nature on its own terms, developing self-rescue skills). The knowledge gained from this research may be used to develop best management practices and guiding principles for the appropriate use of technology in the wilderness. 

  Daniel White  - Graduated 2014 
 Recreational Visitor Use of the Headwaters Forest Reserve   Headwaters Forest Reserve (HFR) has existed since 1999, when the Bureau of Land Management purchased remnants of old-growth forestland from Pacific Lumber Company. The area provides numerous recreation opportunities, including hiking and dog walking. High visitor numbers combined with many different user group types seeking different experience outcomes often leads to conflict, and in recent years instances of human-dog conflict have increased. To assess the nature of human-dog conflict at HFR, 434 visitors to the area were surveyed from May to September 2012. The survey had two components, an on-site interview, and a written survey that was mailed to participants and then mailed back upon completion (71% response rate). Participants were asked about the quality of their visit, agreement with proposed area management strategies, and opinions on the current dog policy. Results showed about 20% of respondents reported conflict between humans and dogs, with figures higher for those visitors who didn’t bring dogs. Significant differences in attitudes about potential management techniques were also found between visitors who bring dogs to HFR and visitors who don’t, with visitors who bring dogs less receptive to more restrictions placed on dogs at HFR. I propose potential management techniques to alleviate conflict by adjusting attitudes of visitors through changing social norms, which includes increasing visitor education and increased enforcement of regulations

  Yosemite Wilderness Visitor Travel Patterns -- Implications for Trailhead Permit Quotas Yosemite National Park uses a trailhead quota system to manage wilderness visitors. Park scientists set user capacities in the 1970s for wilderness zones and trailhead quotas from prevalent travel patterns and a computer simulation model. Limiting how many visitors start daily at a trailhead maintains overnight zone use within capacity if trip characteristics (party size, trip duration, spatiotemporal itinerary adherence) remain similar to the 1970s. Evidence suggests that travel patterns have changed since this system's inception. Data on which the original trailhead quotas were based, and the data on itinerary adherence, are nearly forty years old, and the supposition is that visitor use consists of a larger number of shorter distance and shorter duration trips. Consequently, travel zone capacities are likely being exceeded in some zones on high-use nights. To accurately assess wilderness use distribution and to develop a contemporary travel simulation model, wilderness trips from 1 May - 30 September 2010 were evaluated in regard to mean party size, trip duration, and spatial and temporal adherence to the permit itinerary. Multiple visitor use scenarios (e.g. alternate trailhead permit quotas) were then simulated and the results presented to Yosemite Wilderness managers.

Mark subsequently earned his Ph.D. at the University of Montana in Missoula and is currently an assistant professor at the University of Maine at Machias 

  Dan Shyrock  - Graduated 2010 
  Ecological Conditions and Monitoring Standards for Meadows in the John Muir and Ansel Adams Wilderness Areas, CA. Pack-stock impacts to wilderness meadows have received relatively little research attention. The few studies that have been conducted in high elevation wilderness environments have revealed that even moderate levels of grazing can result in substantial declines in meadow productivity. Despite this, active monitoring of Wilderness grazing areas has traditionally been given far less attention than monitoring of trails or campsites, and in many cases meadows are not monitored at all. As a result, wilderness managers must try to adaptively manage pack stock use with only limited qualitative, often anecdotal information of on-the-ground conditions. The Inyo National Forest has been involved in several lawsuits over the last seven years concerned with pack stock management in the John Muir and Ansel Adams Wilderness Areas. These lawsuits have led the Forest to reevaluate meadow conditions and monitoring needs. My research contributes to that effort by evaluating the ecological conditions of 14 wilderness meadows and examining the effectiveness of different types of resource standards and monitoring techniques.  In particular, my research examines the effectiveness of frequency monitoring in rating meadow ecological conditions, the use and effectiveness of new types of standards, such as graminoid to forb ratios, and the effect of varying use levels on species composition and ground cover. Old monitoring plots were also re-measured in four meadows, allowing for an analysis of trends in species composition over the last 20 years.  

  Kristen Pope  - Graduated 2010 
 Visitor Perceptions of Wilderness Rescue   Wilderness visitation has changed somewhat in recent years with the widespread availability of personal technology such as GPS, cell phones, and emergency personal locator beacons. It is possible this has encouraged individuals from a wider variety of skill levels and backgrounds to visit wilderness. As devices like personal locator beacons become readily available, more visitors may bring them into wilderness and use them to request rescues, and may develop unrealistic expectations of rescue. In 2009, 235 overnight visitors to the King Range Wilderness in California completed a written survey. "Pro-technology" respondents (55% of the sample) felt that technology increased one's safety in wilderness, and would be more likely to use technology to request a wilderness rescue. "Anti-technology" respondents (45%) felt very strongly that technology cannot substitute for skill, experience and knowledge, were very unlikely to take chances that could increase risk just because they had technology with them, and did not agree that technology reduced dangers and made them feel safer in the wilderness. Those with personal experience of a serious wilderness accident were more likely to believe that technology creates a false sense of safety for wilderness users than were people who have not been involved in a serious wilderness accident.

Kristen is currently the Jackson (WY) Representative for the Wyoming Wilderness Association.

            One of several books in Reformation Trust's "Long Line of Godly Men" series, The Heroic Boldness of Martin Luther details what made Luther such a powerful preacher. Most people are familiar with Luther's Ninety-five Theses, nailed to the door of Castle Church, against the practice of the selling of indulgences by the church. Many will know that this was a giant step forward in the Protestant Reformation, but they may not realize that Luther's preaching would go on to be a model that pastors and preachers would continue to follow.


There are five points that Luther believed that caused his preaching to stand out in his time:


1. The Bible is divinely inspired.


2. God's Word is absolutely pure and infallibly true.


3. Scripture alone is the supreme authority for believers.


4. The Bible is clear and understandable to all.


5. The Bible is sufficient.


Luther's belief that Scripture was meant for everyone led him to publish a German New Testament. This New Testament was translated from the original Greek, not the Latin used by the Roman Catholic Church. The importance of Scripture in Luther's sermon preparation was also evident. He always began his study with a prayer to understand what he was about to read, and he often. He focused on the Bible first, and is quoted as saying, "The Bible will be buried under a mass of literature about the Bible, and the text itself will be neglected." He devoted time to exegesis of the Biblical text in the original languages of Hebrew and Greek, as well as the scholarly language of the time, Latin. He also knew that his studies were dependent on the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit.


Above all, Luther's sermons were always Christ-centered. Whatever the text, Luther preached Christ.


This book is very informative as a study on Martin Luther's effectiveness as a preacher, and his dedication to the Word of God.


I was given a free PDF copy of this book from Reformation Trust in exchange for an honest review.

Reflections on Yesterday & Lessons for Today

            Many contemporary Protestants are almost completely ignorant of church history in general and in the history of their own tradition in particular. Probably the one personality that every Protestant has heard something about, however, is Martin Luther. Luther is a Titan; it is probably not an overstatement to say that he is the most influential person of the past 500 years. His influence extends well beyond the rich depths of his theology. This German monk measurably altered the social, economic, political, theological, and linguistic flow of Western culture itself. Luther is the subject of the most recent profile in the Reformed hagiography series A Long Line of Godly Men by Reformation Trust Publishing.


Dr. Steven Lawson, who is the series editor and the author of a number of the other profiles, walks the reader through six chapters that each focus on an element of Luther's life or ministry. These are followed by a concluding chapter that expresses a desire for preachers with similar passions and commitments to be raised up in our time.


The purpose of this series is not to offer serious historical, theological, or biographical analysis. Instead, these books are designed to offer to the reader an illustration of how influential men of faith in the past have interacted with issues of serious concern in our time. They are written to offer encouragement and a little historical perspective to those who identify as conservative evangelicals. They are intended to show that the doctrines and commitments of the faith have been shared and defended for many centuries.


Lawson's writing is clear and his points are well stated. Although the format prevents the author from developing the complex theological and historical contexts in which the selected characteristics of Luther's ministry developed they clearly come through in any more substantial study of Luther's works. Lawson's intention with this profile as well as the broader series is that these brief illustrations offer lessons for the contemporary state of ministry. Lawson does a valuable service when he calls our attention to these elements of Luther's ministry that remain pressingly relevant. These concerns of Luther are just as important now as they were in his day and Lawson recognizes that they always will be. For this reason, it is appropriate for us to understand and take courage from Luther's heroic boldness and Lawson should be thanked for making this material accessible to those who have not the time or inclination to wade through weighty tomes of history or theology.


Luther is such a complex personality that it very difficult to capture him, or his importance, in a single book. Lawson, however, does a good job of connecting the great Reformer to certain fundamental issues related to ministry that continue to be contested and debated in our time. I recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a brief uncritical introduction to Martin Luther, particularly with respect to his work as a preacher.


* I received a free copy of this book from Reformation Trust Publishing as part of their book review program. Reviews are not required to be positive and the opinions I have expressed are my own.
