Man-Portable Generators


Portable generators are units designed  to be lifted into place by hand without the aid of machine power. They are typically configured in an open frame to allow easy access to lift points.
 
Open Frame Current Limiting 2k Generator

This open frame, heavy fuel generator set provides a full 2.0 kW military rated 28V DC power supply over the temperature range of -35° F to 95° F and is suitable for use to charge batteries. The generator control box provides voltage and current meters and an engine hour meter to monitor generator performance. The set is also equipped with a current limiting voltage regulator and NATO Slave Adapter for electric starting from either a vehicle or 24V battery pack. This unit allows the user to charge deep discharged batteries with a small powered generator and still maintain the useful life of the battery. Our current limiting regulator can be tailored for AGM, Li-Ion, and other battery chemistries. Based on our 2kW military heritage, this unit provides a simple power source that is lightweight yet highly reliable and easy to maintain.

Management



John Dewey, Chief Executive OfficerJohn Dewey started his career designing tactical phone systems and doing software consulting.  After a 10-year period working in the commercial world, he returned to lead the Dewey Electronics Corporation in its pursuit of design and development.
John's responsibility is to stay focused on the future.  When given the opportunity to get involved in a product's development, it can cause distress for the engineering and manufacturing departments.Edward L. Proskey - Senior Vice PresidentWalking around the building you will see Ed Proskey in charge of operations, with direct day-to-day management of quality, purchasing, inspection, and facilities.  Many government customers know Ed in his past role as Vice President of Operations with First Article for the 2kW and as Production Manager under the torpedo contracts.  Ed keeps his eye on structures and details to keep engineering and manufacturing on target.
When not at work Ed can be found outdoors with his new camera.

Research & Development






If the problem involves diesel fuel and clean efficient power in a challengingmobile environment, we want to be involved.
Dewey provides research and development engineering, prototyping, testing, and evaluation specifically relating to compact diesel power generation. We sometimes describe it "creating systems that can be fielded quickly - the R&D is focused on integration with a lower case r and upper case D." We can provide practical expertise in dealing with 'constrained parameter systems' for military applications, such as meeting extreme requirements for fuel consumption, space claim, or altitude. Our practical focus includes engineers with years of experience in our manufacturing facility as well as experience getting complete electromechanical systems successfully fielded.
Our prototype team has had multiple careers building production systems and prototyping military hardware. We are neither fuel cell scientists nor power conversion gurus. What we are very good at is integrating best-in-class technology from our partners to produce an optimized overall system with the highest probability of successful operation. We can be critical team members on the development of technologies involving power generation, or we can bring all this experience to trouble shooting an existing system or resolving a design problem while still achieving the minimum possible sized system. Here are some examples of projects we have done.
Fuel Cell and Reformer Systems for the M1 Abrams Tank

Customer Funded: We are not fuel cell or reformer scientists. What we are providing are the controls for operating a complex dirty diesel reformer combined with managing and converting the power output of an 11kW fuel cell. Here we are providing extensive experience on how to build and miniaturize military grade controls, power conversion, power management, and overall system architecture. Partners on the other aspects of the project are ALTEX, Synergy, and the funding agency is the TARDEC. Download Control System for Fuel Reformer Case Study
 
11kW DC to DC Power Conversion for Fuel Cells

Customer Funded: As part of the fuel cell effort, we worked with outside partners to develop a high efficiency compact power conversion system that is capable of managing the loads on the fuel cell stack during startup, full load, and shutdown. Output is 28 volts DC.

Novel Voltage Regulation in Field Wound Alternators
Internally Funded: We developed a novel system for voltage and current regulation in field wound alternators. This was incorporated into our successfully optimized hybrid DC generators that improved energy storage for batteries and provided endpoint DC-AC power conversion.
Leading Edge Diesel Engine Based Battery Charging

Internally Funded: This was an effort to prove out and develop highly fuel efficient and rapid battery charging of lead acid, AGM, and lithium type batteries using man-portable diesel engines. By integrating engine, alternator, current, and voltage control we have been able to demonstrate excellent round trip efficiencies with battery charging while reaching theoretical limits for minimum engine operating time and fuel consumption. We have developed a deep understanding of battery charging combined with significant knowledge of generator design. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched system efficiencies when designing DC generators and integrating energy storage battery systems. 
Proof-of-Concept System for Tactical Idle Reduction of M915 Long HaulTractor Trailer

Customer Funded: Dewey designed, tested, and delivered to the Army two proof-of-concept systems capable of generating 5kW of 120V AC, 3kW of 28V DC, and 1 ton of cooling and heating at -40 degrees F to +130 degrees F. We designed the system and prototyped a diesel generator capable of both AC and DC power and partnered with AMETEK to design and deliver a rugged environment single part ECU for mounting on the back of the 915 cab.  
Other Projects
Sound Mitigation Research on 60hz Air-Cooled Diesel Engines

Customer Funded: Part of a larger contract, this effort focused on mapping sound levels from various components of the 2kW air-cooled open frame diesel generator. We were able to demonstrate reductions in sound from 80 dBa to 72 dBa. This was accomplished by developing resonant air chambers for combustion air intake, internal sound barriers, and a soft fabric enclosure that covered less than 70% of the open area of the generator.
 
Compact Permanent Magnet High Frequency Alternator Design
Internally Funded: We have worked closely with outside resources to design new permanent magnet alternators which we built and integrated with high frequency power electronics. The alternator was designed to operate at speed ranges of 1800 - 3600 RPM, generating voltages in the 100 - 600 volt range and with rated output of 3500 watts.
High Frequency Power Conversion Systems for DC Output
Customer Funded: We have developed the AC - DC power electronics needed to provide mil spec grade power output from high speed permanent magnet alternators in the 1kW - 2kW range. More recently we have provided ground up design and integration of prototype 10kW DC - DC power converters for fuel cell applications. The hardware provides mil spec 28 volt power and carefully managed loading for a 12kW fuel cell with a voltage range of 105 - 250.
Air-Cooled Two Stroke Spark Ignited 3 and 5 hp Ultra Light Diesel Engines
Customer and Internally Funded: We searched out and demonstrated novel diesel engine technology for the creation of lightweight synchronous electrical power generation. This effort involved a novel small diesel engine design with a focus on attempting to transition the technology to a higher TRL for synchronous AC power generation. This project failed; however, we learned a great deal and solved a large number of smaller issues around engine design and optimized performance within military operating environments. We know more than we want to admit about novel small diesel engine technology.
Engine Evaluation
Dewey continues to do validation research on new commercial engines for use in existing generator systems.

Custom Solutions


Dewey Electronics strives to develop the optimum solution to our customers' needs. We don't "force fit" a catalog item solution when a custom approach is needed.
Custom-Designed Generators
Custom-designed generators are available from Dewey Electronics. We custom-design open frame or enclosed units that meet your sound level and mounting requirements and provide the power interface to your system that enhances its performance. You can select from a number of existing enclosures that can be made available, or you can request modifications to these enclosures. We can also provide a completely customized enclosure for your specific application.
Our engineering team will work with you to provide the exact enclosure that meets your specific needs. We review the mechanical, serviceability, maintainability, system, environmental, and electrical requirements with you to be sure that the enclosed MTG will perform as expected.
Our units have been trailer mounted, vehicle mounted, and ground mounted in all possible environmental conditions. These units charge battery systems, pump fuel from remote fuel tanks, are airlifted into desert environments, and operate in extreme cold and heat to support military, border security, transportation, and government programs worldwide.
Enclosed 2kW Generator

This enclosure was designed to house our current limiting battery charging 2kW 28V DC generator. Its unique design limits sound and keeps the air-cooled engine operating in high ambient temperatures and extreme sandy and dusty environments. The unit is designed to mount on trailers for off-road applications. Electrically the generator features auto start/stop controls, battery management technologies, and remote control capabilities.
Enclosed 2kW 28V DC Generator features:

Auto start and stop controls
Battery monitoring and charging
Current limiting output
Electrical fuel pump with 72-inch lift
Data bus interface for remote monitoring and control
Simple one-switch operation
Electrical starting off system battery
Hybrid operation to reduce fuel consumption
Capable of interfacing with renewable energy sources such as solar or wind
Interfaces with multiple battery chemistries

Custom-Designed APU

Dewey Electronics Corporation designs and encloses custom APUs for various uses. The pictured APU is a 3000W, 28V DC unit custom-designed and manufactured by Dewey Electronics. This APU was designed to operate in silent watch or to charge the vehicle batteries.

3kW 28V DC EAPU Features

Direct replacement (mechanically and electrically) for the M1A1 APU
Enclosure small arms fire resistant
Mounts and operates in high shock environment
High reliability
Ease of maintenance


Custom-Designed Open Frame Skid Mounted Generators

Custom applications require changes to our standard 2kW generator. In one case our customer needed the generator to be mounted on a skid and electrically started from its own battery pack. This custom design included an upgrade to a more powerful engine and needed to be provided on an accelerated schedule.
 
Another customer required that the standard 2kW generator be electrically started from a battery pack that would be skid mounted. Dewey’s engineering team designed a battery skid that would allow the standard 2kW to be stacked above the battery skid. The generator would charge the batteries and provide power for the user’s application.

Portable generators are the units designed to be lifted into place by hand without the aid of machine power. They are typically configured in an open frame to allow easy access to lift points.
Since 1996 Dewey Electronics has been manufacturing and supplying the 2kW Military Tactical Generator to the Department of Defense PM-Mobile Electric Power (PM-MEP). We have fielded over 17,000 Military Tactical Generators (MTGs) in an open frame configuration. Learn more >

Hybrid Power Generation Systems
Our hybrid generators are designed to charge and monitor batteries, and when equipped with our auto-start and shut down controls, conserve fossil fuel and can be integrated with other alternative and renewable energy sources. These generators come in either open frame or enclosed configurations and are suitable for trailer or vehicle mounting.

Originally designed to charge batteries, this open frame 28V DC generator is available in two power sizes: 3.5kW and 4.5kW. Learn more >
4.5kW 28V DC Hybrid Power Generation System
This system combines the generating power of diesel with the energy storage of AGM or Li-Ion batteries and can integrate renewable energy sources such as solar or wind to produce a hybrid power system that provides scalable power outputs saving 30%-70% of fossil fuel when compared to standard diesel generators of comparable output size. Learn more
2kW 28V DC Enclosed Hybrid Generator
The enclosed 2kW 28V DC generator features auto start and shut down, battery charging and battery monitoring functions, and is enclosed for trailer mounting. Learn more
Vehicle Auxiliary Power Units (APU)

This 4.5kW APU is capable of being mounted on any of three axes. It provides vehicles with 28VDC power for battery charging and subsystem power. Learn more >
5kW 230V AC APU
Designed to mount on top of a 2000-gallon ISO containerized remote fueling station, this APU is electrically started to power the fuel pump for USMC vehicle refueling.Learn more >
5kW 28V DC APU
The 5kW 28V DC Generator, Model MEP-952B, has been added to our APU line. Please go the the Product Info & Resources page for more information.
Custom Solutions
Our customers have applications that cannot be addressed with our standard prodcuts. It could be a mounting requirement, output power need, or a complete new design that requires a novel approach to power generation. Dewey's past performance makes us the company to "go to" if your needs require customization.
External Auxiliary Power Unit (EAPU) 28V DC 3kW
The EAPU was custom designed for the USMC as a direct replacement (but with more power: 3kW) for the External Auxiliary Power Unit on the M1A1 tank. The Dewey EAPU is an example of our custom solutions. Learn more >
Skid Mounted
Satisfying a rapid need for a custom design, Dewey provided HDT with this specialized generator. Learn more >
Battery Skid and Generator
Designed for a major prime defense manufacturer, this custom unit contains a 24V battery within a battery skid, and our standard 2kW 28V DC current-limiting generator system for an application-specific requirement.  Learn more >

Dewey Electronics has developed generator accessories that make our generators more versatile and capable for our end-users. Learn more >

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
