Kitchen Sinks FAQs



Q: 
What is Vikrell®?


Solid Vikrell material by Sterling offers exceptional strength combined with resistance to chipping, cracking and peeling. Vikrell is a solid composite material made of resins, fiberglass and filler that is exclusive to Kohler Company. The material is compression molded in large presses to form baths and wall surrounds that are structurally rigid yet lightweight and feature a non-porous surface that is easy to clean. Click here to learn more about Vikrell material. 



Q: 
Is higher or lower gauge steel better?


The lower the gauge, the thicker the steel. Thick steel is less likely to dent and is more sound resistant.



Q: 
What is SilentShield® technology?


SilentShield sound-deadening pads are applied to all STERLING sinks creating a quieter sink (from clanging disposal or silverware) versus many competitors. The sound-deadening technology was borrowed from the auto industry.

Bathtubs FAQs



Q: 
What is the difference between a right-hand and left-hand bath?


When looking at a whirlpool or bath, you must establish the reference point, which is the entry side or threshold. From the entry side of the whirlpool or bath, the drain location determines whether the unit is right-hand or left-hand.  An right-hand bath has its drain on the right side and a left-hand bath has its drain on the left side.



Q: 
What is the removable apron option?


The apron or skirt, covers the front of a bath or whirlpool.  A removable apron allows limited access to the pump/motor and to plumbing system components on the apron side of the unit.



Q: 
The bathtub in my home measures 58" but I cannot find a STERLING bathtub for that size?


The standard size for bathtubs is 60" and are installed in the rough stage of construction (against the studs). After rough installation a 1/2" of wall board and a 1/2" of tile is typically added on top of the studs at each end of the bath making a finished installation roughly 58".

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below under "Risks and Uncertainties," that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.  Overview  Business of Sterling Group Ventures Inc.  Sterling Group Ventures Inc. (the "Company"), through its acquisition of Euroclub Holding Limited, provides a B2B and B2C multi-gaming platform under the MOJO brand name with a full suite of social play money and real money gaming products, including online poker, casino games, and third party integrations to live dealer, e-sports, sports betting and skill games. Mojo offers B2B partners both API integrated and turnkey white label licensing options with an advanced iGaming platform, back-office suite and global payment processing.  Share Exchange Agreement with Euroclub Holding Ltd.  On November 11, 2016, the Company signed a definitive share exchange agreement with Euroclub Holding Ltd. ("Euroclub") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Euroclub and its wholly owned subsidiary companies. As a result, Euroclub will become a subsidiary of Sterling with business in Brazil, Russia, India, China and Europe. The company's online gaming platform is being launched in India and China.  Euroclub is a well-established online gaming company, with gaming licenses in Malta and Curacao, providing business-to-business ("B2B") and business-to-customers ("B2C") multi-gaming platform under the "Mojo" brand name with a full suite of social and real money gaming products, including online poker, casino games, and third party integrations to live dealer, e-sports, sports betting and skill games. Mojo offers B2B partners both API integrated and turnkey white label licensing options with comprehensive global payment processing. The Mojo technology is a robust, well established architecture that supports a flexible, customized suite of products for end customers. In addition to Mojo's multiplayer poker, casino and skill games, Mojo offers multiple 3rd party content providers that are tightly integrated to and managed by Mojo's back office and state-of-the-art security systems. Mojo supports over 40 payment processors with 24/7 customer support and security and fraud management with multicurrency and multilingual solutions. Mojo hosts affiliate, agent and sub-agent systems and provides solutions for social-play money and land based casinos. Mojo's technology is a key differentiator that allows the Company to continue to win business from much larger competitors.  The Euroclub management team is experienced and is positioned to rapidly grow the business, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. The Company has a number of key international partnerships and initiatives that should drive the growth profile to our goal of doubling revenues each year to 2020. As well, our technology is well known in the industry and we believe our proprietary platform is 'best of breed'. We are expanding our offerings to social gaming, emerging markets, and mobile/tablet devices while increasing the line-up of our own games. Our marketing team continues to target mid-size operators requiring more custom and specialized B2B services with a focus on emerging market opportunities. Our consumer strategy is driven by offering high quality games and bigger rewards to players acquired through affiliate partnerships.  Euroclub's registered office is in Malta with 25 technical staff in Vancouver, Dublin and Barcelona and support over 20 B2B partners and B2C operations with gaming licenses in Malta and Curacao.  Under the terms of the agreement, Sterling will issue 170,285,697 common shares and 791,500 redeemable and exchangeable preferred shares which are convertible into common at $0.20. Once converted, those common shares have 5 warrants attached exercisable at $0.20 with a term of 3 years. As of January 11, 2017, these shares have been issued and the transaction has now closed.  Purchase and Sale Agreement with Chenguo Capital Limited  On April 9, 2016, the Company signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement ("Agreement") with Chenguo Capital Limited ("Chenguo"). As a result of the transaction, the Company had plans to diversify and become a timeshare exchange provider, a manager of timeshare assets through agreements, and a developer of timeshare assets with fee relationships with other organizations or resorts.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company would be required to issue 85,000,000 shares on April 19, 2016 to Chenguo. Pursuant to an escrow agreement, the 85,000,000 shares were contingently issuable and only released from escrow upon completion of the transaction and when the timeshare assets are transferred to the Company. In connection with this agreement, the Company also issued 8,000,000 shares, pursuant to an escrow agreement representing a finder's fee to be released on completion of the transaction.  The Company also remitted RMB1,895,353 ($295,726) to the other party on April 22, 2016 for the development of the timeshare platform.  On September 5, 2016, both parties agreed to terminate the Agreement and the Company agreed to reimburse the parties to the Agreement HK$125,000 ($16,090) on the related expenses incurred.  Pursuant to the termination agreement, on September 9, 2016, the Company cancelled the 85,000,000 escrow shares and 8,000,000 shares issued as finder's fees, subject to the escrow agreement. The Company also expensed in project development cost $295,726 funds advanced for the development of timeshare platform and recorded $16,090 and an additional $7,750 for expenses incurred by the other parties affiliated with Chenguo termination in due diligence cost in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company has determined there is a contingent liability related to the cancellation of the 8,000,000 shares related to the finder's fee. Based on the early stage of the claim and evaluation of the facts available at this time, the amount or range of reasonably possible losses to which the Company is exposed cannot be estimated and the ultimate resolution of this matter and the associated financial impact to the Company, if any, remains uncertain at this time. We believe the claim is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  Our condensed interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this quarterly report.  We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our annual financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, the following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.  Basis of Presentation  These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Micro Express Holdings Inc., Micro Express Ltd., Huyana Ventures Limited, Makaelo Holdings Inc., Makaelo Limited, Silver Castle Investments Limited ("Silver Castle") and our 100% controlled subsidiary, Chenxi County Hongyu Mining Co. Ltd. ("Hongyu"). All inter-company transactions and account balances have been eliminated.  Interim Reporting  The information presented in the accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements is without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Except where noted, the condensed interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as our May 31, 2016 annual consolidated financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested that these condensed interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with our May 31, 2016 annual consolidated financial statements.  Operating results for the six months ended November 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending May 31, 2017.  Mineral Property Costs  Costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalized by the project area. Costs to maintain mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred. When a property reaches the production state, the related capitalized costs are amortized using the unit of production method on the basis of annual estimates of ore reserves. The Company does not consider a resource property to be at the development stage until such time as either mineral reserve are proven or permits to operate the mineral resource property are received and financing to complete the development has been obtained. Development expenditures incurred subsequent to a development decision, and to increase or to extend the life of existing production, are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method based upon estimated proven and probable reserves or resources.  Management reviews the carrying value of mineral properties at least annually and will recognize impairment in value based upon current exploration results, and any impairment or subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment. If a property is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Exploration activities conducted jointly with others are reflected at the Company's proportionate interest in such activities. As at May 31, 2016, management reviewed the carrying value of the mineral properties and the environmental deposit and determined that the prolonged and significant decline in phosphate prices and the lack of a current and foreseeable planned exploration budget on its Gaoping phosphate property and has impaired these assets to a nominal value. An impairment charge of $3,271,005 has been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended May 31, 2016. As at November 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have proven or probable ore reserves.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation - Stock Compensation - Overall.  In accordance with ASC 718-10, the compensation expense is amortized on a straight- line basis over the requisite service period which approximates the vesting period. ASC Topic 718-10 requires excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options and the extension of the expiry date of share purchase warrants previously granted  Foreign Currency Translation  Our functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars. Our consolidated financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, "Foreign Currency Matters". Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. We have not, to the date of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of condensed interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Going Concern  These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  In order to continue as a going concern, we require additional financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, we would likely be unable to realize the carrying value of our assets reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements.  At November 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations and has accumulated losses of $10,466,434 since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. On November 11, 2016 the Company signed a Share Exchange Agreement through which the Company acquired Euroclub and its operations in the online gaming business. On November 16, 2016 the Company completed a private placement for $500,000 in order to help fund its existing operations and Euroclub's operations. The Company has no assurance that Euroclub's operations will be able to fund the Company's operations in the short-term, but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  Results Of Operations  The Company had no operating revenue except interest income of $106 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared with interest income of $3,514 for the quarter ended November 30, 2015. The Company had no operating revenue except interest income of $218 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared with interest income of $7,437 for the six months ended November 30, 2015. The operating loss for the three months ended November 30, 2016 increased to $66,380, as compared to $63,913 for the three months ended November 30, 2015. The operating loss for the six months ended November 30, 2016 decreased to $144,772, as compared to $147,881 for the six months ended November 30, 2015.  Accounting, audit, legal and professional fees increased by $34,734 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 and accounting, audit, legal and professional fees increased by $49,754 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to an increase in audit and legal fees arising from the cancellation of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Chenguo.  Depreciation decreased by $699 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, and depreciation decreased by $3,861 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was as a result of some equipment becoming fully depreciated and because the Company was in a maintenance period no new equipment was purchased.  Foreign exchange gain (loss) increased by $19,038 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, while foreign exchange gain (loss) increased by $43,192 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 because of the exchange rate fluctuation among US dollar, Canadian dollar and RMB. Specifically, this was primarily due to the RMB/USD exchange rate changing from 0.15191 RMB/USD to  Mineral property costs decreased by $19,657 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, and Mineral property costs decreased by $23,344 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 because the Gaoping phosphate property was kept in care and maintenance mode during the period ended November 30, 2016 due to ongoing challenges in the phosphate market.  Shareholder information and investor relations increased by $1,868 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, while Shareholder information increased by $2,993 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 due to the announcements relating to the Share Exchange Agreement signed with Euroclub.  Filing fee and transfer agent increased by $2,184 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, while Filing fee and transfer agent increased by $1,919 for the six months ended November 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The Company expects the trend of losses to continue until we can achieve operating income from our online gaming business, of which there can be no assurance as described in Risk Factors.  Liquidity And Working Capital  As of November 30, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $1,258,022 and total current liabilities of $422,931. As of November 30, 2016, the Company had cash totaling $811,906, and a working capital balance of $835,091. This is an increase from the previous quarter due to the private placement completed on November 16, 2016 of which $70,000 was retained by Sterling with the balance advanced to Euroclub. A balance of approximately $720,474 of cash is held on deposit in China at November 30, 2016. Accessing the cash held on deposits in Hongyu is difficult due to the People Republic of China laws and regulations relating to intercorporate transfers and capital accounts.  Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended November 30, 2016 was $125,842 as compared to cash used in operating activities for the six months ended November 30, 2015 was $118,488. This increase was due to fees arising out of the cancellation of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Chenguo as well as the signing of the Share Exchange Agreement with Euroclub.  The Company has no other capital resources other than the ability to use its common stock to raise additional capital or the exercise of the warrants by the unit holders. If all warrants outstanding are exercised, the Company will receive approximately $5 million in cash. The Company's current cash cannot meet its needs for the next 12 months. The Company is currently looking at funding its activities such as a private placement, related party advances, sale of non-core assets and possible repatriation of our foreign capital. The Company believes it needs to raise $1,000,000 in order to meet its needs for the next 12 months. The cash will be mainly used for general administrative, corporate (accounting, audit, and legal), financing, management and for the online gaming operations of Euroclub. The Company completed a private placement on November 16, 2016 for $500,000, of which $430,000 was advanced to Euroclub. The Company currently does not have commitments in place for further financing as of the date of this filing.  No other commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management or other stockholders except as set forth above. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to the Company to allow it to cover operation expenses. This raises substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, we require additional financing.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Jan 17, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Kitchen Sinks FAQs



Q: 
What is Vikrell®?


Solid Vikrell material by Sterling offers exceptional strength combined with resistance to chipping, cracking and peeling. Vikrell is a solid composite material made of resins, fiberglass and filler that is exclusive to Kohler Company. The material is compression molded in large presses to form baths and wall surrounds that are structurally rigid yet lightweight and feature a non-porous surface that is easy to clean. Click here to learn more about Vikrell material. 



Q: 
Is higher or lower gauge steel better?


The lower the gauge, the thicker the steel. Thick steel is less likely to dent and is more sound resistant.



Q: 
What is SilentShield® technology?


SilentShield sound-deadening pads are applied to all STERLING sinks creating a quieter sink (from clanging disposal or silverware) versus many competitors. The sound-deadening technology was borrowed from the auto industry.

Bathtubs FAQs



Q: 
What is the difference between a right-hand and left-hand bath?


When looking at a whirlpool or bath, you must establish the reference point, which is the entry side or threshold. From the entry side of the whirlpool or bath, the drain location determines whether the unit is right-hand or left-hand.  An right-hand bath has its drain on the right side and a left-hand bath has its drain on the left side.



Q: 
What is the removable apron option?


The apron or skirt, covers the front of a bath or whirlpool.  A removable apron allows limited access to the pump/motor and to plumbing system components on the apron side of the unit.



Q: 
The bathtub in my home measures 58" but I cannot find a STERLING bathtub for that size?


The standard size for bathtubs is 60" and are installed in the rough stage of construction (against the studs). After rough installation a 1/2" of wall board and a 1/2" of tile is typically added on top of the studs at each end of the bath making a finished installation roughly 58".
