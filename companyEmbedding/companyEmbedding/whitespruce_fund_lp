Company Description


BlueSpruce seeks to deliver high risk-adjusted absolute returns by leveraging the founders’ private equity background. The BlueSpruce Funds seek to combine seasoned business judgment, a fundamental value-oriented research approach, rigorous due diligence and a long-term investment horizon, along with patient capital in the form of a 3-year lock-up. BlueSpruce targets investments that are meaningfully mispriced and offer both attractive returns and a margin of safety. The BlueSpruce Fund targets over-a-cycle approximately 25% of the Fund’s portfolio to be held in cash and/or in income-yielding asset classes with attractive risk-return trade-offs. Such asset classes are expected to include non-investment grade debt and closed-end funds, among other income-yielding assets. ^^The WhiteSpruce Fund seeks to combine seasoned business judgment, a fundamental value-oriented research approach, and rigorous due diligence to select a combination of selected U.S. equities and securities benchmarked to the S&P index. The target net equity exposure for the WhiteSpruce Fund is 100%. WhiteSpruce is currently not being marketed to outside investors. ^^
