Fountainhead Advisors
Don’t work with a  “financial advisor”. Work with someone you like.












What We Believe Our 10-point manifesto for radically improving your frame of mind.





you should be receiving total financial life advice, not just investment advice.

If your financial advisor doesn’t invest the time to really get to know you, they can’t do meaningful work for you. There’s no way.

You have a career and a family and a life. You’re not supposed to somehow be a genius at financial planning and investing, too. It’s OK to get some help.

You can do what you want with your life. We’re your champion, and we can help you make it happen.

You should feel empowered by a financial advisor, never intimidated or judged.

There is no financial concept that cannot be explained in plain English so you can make a clear, informed decision.

You need a bunch of specialists, not a bunch of generalists.

Life isn’t always 75 and sunny. It’s not always hellish and dark, either. A good financial plan accounts for both.

If we’re going to work together, we should enjoy each other. Life’s too short.

It’s not as hard as you think to organize your financial life. We’ll help you do it, and you’ll feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

NOTE   The
purpose of this Schedule 13D filing is to update the ownership of Vycor Medical, Inc. (“the Company”) Common Stock,
par value $0.0001 (“Vycor Common Shares”). On April 30, 2017, the Company issued 1,571,429 shares of
Vycor Common Stock to Fountainhead as a milestone payment of $330,000 on Fountainhead’s Consultancy Agreement and on
June 30, 2017, the Company issued an additional 501,429 shares to Fountainhead in satisfaction of $105,300 of consulting
fees due for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. As a result of such issue, Fountainhead’s previously-reporting
holdings of Vycor Common Stock (including shares which it has the option to acquire within sixty (60) days of such date) were
adjusted to a total of 12,650,199 shares, comprising ownership of 9,120,757 Vycor Common Shares and Warrants to
purchase 3,531,198 Vycor Common Shares as follows: 343,411 shares at an exercise price of $1.88 per share prior to August 4, 2017;
337,517 shares at an exercise price of $2.62 per share prior to August 4, 2017; 572,613 shares at an exercise price of $3.08 per
share prior to August 4, 2017, 1,924,677 shares at an exercise price of $0.27 per share prior to January 10, 2020 and
351,204 share at an exercise price of $0.27 per share prior to February 22, 2020. Such shares, in the aggregate, comprise
approximately 54.44% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, as adjusted for the exercise
of such warrants. Additionally, on March 31, 2017, Fountainhead was granted options to purchase 660,000 shares of Company Common
Stock at $0.27 per share for a period of three (3) years from the date of vesting. Vesting shall occur upon the achievement of
certain milestones prior to March 31, 2018. None of these milestones are capable of being achieved within 60 days of the date
of this report and, as a result thereof, these shares have not been included in the shares listed above.   This
Schedule 13D is being filed by Fountainhead Capital Management Limited to disclose its ownership of approximately 50.1% of the
Company’s outstanding Common Stock.   Item
1. Security and Issuer.   The
name of the issuer is Vycor Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation which has its principal offices at 6401 Congress Ave. Suite
140, Boca Raton, FL 33487. This statement relates to the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share.   Item
2. Identity and Background.   (a).
This Schedule 13D is being filed by Fountainhead Capital Management Limited, a Jersey, C.I. corporation, which has its principal
offices at Portman House, Hue Street, Jersey, Channel Islands, JE4 5RP (the “Reporting Person”).   During
the last five years, the Reporting Person has not been (A) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or
similar misdemeanors) or (B) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and
as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting
or mandating activities subject to, Federal or State securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.   Item
3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.   Payment  of
a $330,000 milestone payment and $105,300 consulting fees
due to Fountainhead by the Company.   Item
4. Purpose of Transaction.   The
Reporting Person received 1,571,429 shares in lieu of a milestone
payment and 501,429 shares in lieu of consulting fees (see Explanatory Note), above.   Except
as set forth in this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Person has made no proposals, and has entered into no agreements, which would
be related to or would result in any of the events or matters described in part (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.       Item
5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.   (a) The
    Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of 12,650,199 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 54.44%
    of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. Said amount includes all shares issuable to the Reporting
    Person on account of all Warrants held by the Reporting Person convertible or exercisable within sixty (60) days of the date
    of this report. Other than as described therein, the Reporting Person does not own any other securities of the Company. The
    holder believes the number of shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock to be 19,708,406 as of June
    30, 2017. Additionally, on March 31, 2017, Fountainhead was granted options to purchase 660,000 shares of Company Common
    Stock at $0.27 per share for a period of three (3) years from the date of vesting. Vesting shall occur upon the achievement
    of certain milestones prior to March 31, 2018. None of these milestones are capable of being achieved within 60 days of the
    date of this report and, as a result thereof, these shares have not been included in the shares listed above.   (b) The
    Reporting Person has the sole power to vote and dispose of the 12,650,199 shares, less the number of shares which are
    currently subject to issuance only upon the exercise of Warrants.   (c) Except
    for the transactions described in the Explanatory Note above, the Reporting Person did not effect any transactions in the
    issuer’s securities within the past 60 days.   (d) No
    other person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from
    the sale of, the Reporting Person’s securities.   (e) Not
    applicable.  Item
6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.   Except
as described in the Explanatory Note, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise)
among the Reporting Person and any other person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including, but not limited to transfer
or voting of any of the securities, finder’s fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees
of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies.   Item
