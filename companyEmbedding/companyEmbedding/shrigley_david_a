DescriptionDetailsReviews
'Irreverent, mischievous, funny, and charming' -The Daily Telegraph

Best-known for his wry and witty drawings, British artist David Shrigley describes his work as ‘somewhere between handwriting and drawing’, and furthermore ‘not the kind of drawing where you’re trying to get their eyes in the right place’. Well known for his cartoons, this catalogue to the Hayward Gallery's 2012 exhibition extends well beyond Shrigley's deadpan drawing to include photography, sculpture, neon signs, animation, painting, printmaking, publishing and music. 
The book features an interview by writer Dave Eggers, essays by Martin Herbert and Cliff Lauson and an original piece of prose contributed by artist Jonathan Monk. The book also features a new 7-inch picture disc featuring exclusive recorded original spoken word material created specifically for the book. 




Author: Cliff Lausson, Curator, Hayward Gallery

Hardcover: 188 pages


Date published: January 2012


Language: English


ISBN: 978-1853322976


Product Dimensions: 26.7 x 20.3 x 2.5 cm




'this is a wonderful show. Shrigley's works are silly, scrappy, hilarious, often macabre, but more often than not they possess a profundity and wisdom many artists crave' - The Evening Standard

'Irreverent, mischievous, funny, and charming' - The Daily Telegraph
'Not quite satire, not quite comedy, the mood of the drawings swerves between irony, melancholy and a certain ruefulness' - London Review of Books

‘I wanted to call it “Fancy rooms filled with crap”,’ muses David Shrigley at the opening of his latest exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, ‘but they said no.’ However, the show’s eventual title, Brain Activity, is rather apt, as it opens a window on to the artist’s methods of working' - Design Curial

    See all 5 reviews4.0 out of 5 starsSimply HilariousByMichael McMahonon January 16, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThe droll hip Scots wit repeatedly does the near-impossible, which is to make this veteran humor-writer laugh out loud.  How Shrigley does it is an enigma.  Possibly it's some car-crash of paradoxes--knowing innocence; optimistic nihilism; sage insanity--delivering a sneaky critique of our bleak state of affairs.  He's the child raised by wolves whose scrawls are destined for museum walls.  Yeah, I love this artist.

This domino set is part of our new Play collection, a collaboration between Third Drawer Down Studio and David Shrigley. Shrigley is a Glasgow-based artist best known for his cartoon-like drawings which rely on satire and dark humor to disarm shyness and let out laughter.


There's rarely a dull moment when you're playing games with David Shrigley. Instead of the traditional uniform of matching dots and tiles, you'll find characters like skulls, grumpy old men and raggedy cats on each piece. A perfect diversion for when you or your partner are plotting your next move.




The domino pieces are housed in a black vinyl box that is printed with a drawing by artist David Shrigley.


Contains 28 dominoes
