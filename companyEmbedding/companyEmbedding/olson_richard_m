Method for providing grooved roller with variable shoulders



Patent number:  6588191
                                            

Abstract:  A plurality of annular collars are provided formed from collar halves. The collar halves are at least partially separable from one another to allow the collar halves to be slipped into and around a groove in a grooved roller for a reel-type cutting unit. The collar halves can then be abutted and secured together to substantially fill in the roller groove. When collars are placed into the last two or three grooves on each end of a grooved roller, a non-shouldered grooved roller is thereby converted into a shouldered grooved roller without having to remove and replace one set of rollers with another.

Combination low oil indicator and kill switch for internal combustion magneto driven engine



Patent number:  5451733
                                            

Abstract:  An electrical switch has three terminals, one that is always connected to one side of an LED and in parallel to a resistor. A rocker slides a movable contact to and from an engine OFF or kill position, from and to an engine RUN position. An oil detector circuit uses the engines magneto system to light the LED when the switch is in the RUN position and the engine is rotated. The flashing LED provides a visual indication of low oil in the engine.

Combined dry-wet milling process for refining corn



Patent number:  4181748
                                            

Abstract:  A continuous process for refining whole grain corn to obtain a prime corn starch fraction, an animal feed product and, optionally, corn oil. The process comprises dry milling corn kernels to provide an endosperm fraction, a germ fraction, a fiber (hull) fraction and a cleanings fraction, wet milling the endosperm fraction including using two distinct steeping steps, one upstream and the other downstream of an impact milling step, to provide a mill starch slurry. The process further comprises removing fine fiber tailings from the mill starch slurry, separating the slurry into a starch-rich fraction and protein-rich fraction, concentrating the protein-rich fraction, directly combining the fiber (hull), cleanings, fine fiber tailings and protein-rich concentrate without removing corn oil therefrom, with the germ fraction to provide a wet animal feed product, and drying the feed product. Optionally, corn oil is recovered from the germ fraction only.

The following year Olson was named vice president, international business before being elected group vice president, international business, micro-irrigation business and distributor development in June 2014.
Reflecting on the coming changes, Hoffman stated, “Serving our employees and customers as Toro’s chief executive officer has been the greatest privilege of my career. Our employees’ and channel partners’ passion for the business and relentless commitment to our company and brands have enabled us to accomplish much together. Looking forward, I am pleased and confident in passing the responsibilities of chief executive on to such a strong and tested leader as Rick Olson. His extensive experience, intelligence and commitment to our company’s core values make him an ideal candidate for his new role.”
Hoffman joined Toro in 1977 and served the company in various service, sales and marketing roles before holding a series of key executive positions across the company’s commercial and residential businesses. He was elected president in October 2004, CEO in March 2005 and chairman of the board in March 2006. Hoffman has served on the board of directors of Donaldson Company, Inc., since 2005. He also currently serves on the board of overseers of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
“I am honored to have the opportunity to continue the storied legacy of our great company that Mike and leaders before him like Ken Melrose and David Lilly helped build through the decades, making Toro all that it is today,” said Olson. “Like my predecessors, I will rely on the dedication and hard work of the entire Toro family. I look forward to working closely with our talented employees and channel partners to keep our company growing by delivering superior innovation and superior customer care.”
