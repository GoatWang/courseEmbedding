IntroductionA tried and tested formulaFor more than two decades, Chris Burvill, Fund Manager of the Henderson Cautious Managed Fund, has been using his tried and tested investment process to deliver attractive returns to investors over the longer term at lower levels of volatility. Mixing equities, bonds and cash his strategy aims to take advantage of market movements whilst at the same time avoiding excessive risk. A simple formula that has proved it works.Chris developed his fundamental investment process in 1993 whilst he was at Investec. 10 years of successful investing later he moved to Gartmore to run their Cautious Managed Fund which has since become the Henderson Cautious Managed Fund that we know today.
About the fundChris Burvill discusses the Henderson Cautious Managed Fund which launched in early 2003. The aim of the fund is to give retail investors exposure to the growth of equities over the longer term whilst reducing some of the volatility.
Why investA recipe for success​Straightforward investment approachSimple portfolio constructionTransparency of fund manager decisionsAims to provide income and capital growthLess volatility than a pure equity fundCurrently offers an attractive yield, paid quarterly - 2.8% as at 30 April 2015**As they say, proof is in the pudding and since launch, the fund has delivered a total return of 146.3% *My overall approach is focused on keeping things simple by concentrating on delivering returns to investors using equities, bonds and cash. Avoiding the more complex asset classes and structures such as derivatives has meant I have been able to keep the fund as straightforward as possible - giving investors the potential for income growth over the long term combined with lower levels of volatility than pure equity funds. And looking at the track record of my fund over the past decade, you can see this strategy has proved to be a success.”Chris Burvill, Fund ManagerDiscrete performanceShare classMar 2014 - Mar 2015Mar 2013 - Mar 2014Mar 2012 - Mar 2013Mar 2011 - Mar 2012Mar 2010 - Mar 2011A Acc5.7%7.9%14.3%3.3%5.0%© Morningstar 2015.

You may get back less than
you originally invested.​Past performance is not a guide to future performance.​You should note that your tax treatment in relation to any investments held outside an ISA will depend on your individual
circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Governments may change the tax rules which affect you or the
Funds in which you have invested.Third party data is believed to be reliable, but its completeness and accuracy is not guaranteed. Specific risks Investment management techniques that have worked well in normal market conditions could prove ineffective or detrimental at other times.Shares can lose value rapidly, and typically involve higher risks than bonds or money market instruments. The value of your investment may fall as a result.The Fund could lose money if a counterparty with which it trades becomes unwilling or unable to meet its obligations to the Fund.The value of a bond or money market security may fall if the financial health of the issuer weakens, or the market believes it may weaken. This risk is greater the lower the credit quality of the bond.  Derivatives use exposes the Fund to risks different from, and potentially greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and may therefore result in additional loss, which could be significantly greater than the cost of the derivative.Changes in currency exchange rates may cause the value of your investment and any income from it to rise or fall.Measures designed to reduce the impact of certain risks may not be available or may be ineffective.When interest rates rise (or fall), the prices of different securities will be affected differently.  In particular, bond values generally fall when interest rates rise. This risk is generally greater the longer the maturity of a bond investment.Any security could become hard to value or to sell at a desired time and price, increasing the risk of investment losses.General informationFunds incur costs as a necessary part of buying and selling the underlying investments, these are otherwise known as portfolio transaction costs, and include charges such as broker commission and Stamp Duty Reserve tax (SDRT).

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

The Investment Manager may also invest in companies incorporated elsewhere that have significant assets, business, production, trading activity or other interests in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. At least two thirds of the total assets of this Fund will be invested in (i) companies having their registered office in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan (ii) companies with their registered office outside China, Hong Kong or Taiwan carrying out their business activities predominantly in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan, or (iii) holding companies, the interests of which are predominantly invested in companies with their registered office in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. The Fund may invest in China A-Shares, directly through Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and other eligible exchanges or indirectly through derivative instruments. Exposure to China A-Shares will not be more than 35% of the Fund’s net asset value.

The Investment Manager will adopt a broad range of investment strategies using a diversified range of instruments with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund.  Particularly, the Investment Manager will employ an approach to investment decisions using primarily a Fundamental strategy as further described under the Section ‘General Policy applicable to Funds making active use of derivatives and using a Fundamental strategy’ of this Prospectus.

The approach will be implemented by using the following instruments in accordance with the Section ‘Investment Restrictions’ of this Prospectus: quoted equity securities, structured notes, options, futures and forwards on stocks, indices, contracts for difference, OTC swaps including equity swaps and asset swaps, equity linked notes and currency forwards. On an ancillary basis, and for defensive purposes, the Fund may also invest in government, government agency and corporate bonds and their associated derivative securities, preferred stock, money market instruments and may hold cash or treasury bills pending reinvestment. The Investment Manager may from time to time consider hedging currency and interest rates exposure, but will not generally enter into contracts involving a speculative position in any currency or interest rate.OverviewNote: You should not make investment decisions based solely on marketing materials. You should read the Prospectus and the Product Highlights Sheet of the Fund for more details of the investment risks and seek independent professional advice where appropriate.Before you invest

you originally invested.​Past performance is not a guide to future performance.​For detailed product information including the risks associated with investing please read the relevant Prospectus or Annual Report.Before investing in any of our funds you should satisfy yourself as to the suitability and the risks involved, you may wish to consult a financial adviser.Third party data is believed to be reliable, but its completeness and accuracy is not guaranteed. Specific risks Investment management techniques that have worked well in normal market conditions could prove ineffective or detrimental at other times.Shares can lose value rapidly, and typically involve higher risks than bonds or money market instruments. The value of your investment may fall as a result.The Fund could lose money if a counterparty with which it trades becomes unwilling or unable to meet its obligations to the Fund.Derivatives use exposes the Fund to risks different from, and potentially greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and may therefore result in additional loss, which could be significantly greater than the cost of the derivative.Emerging markets are less established and more prone to political events than developed markets. This can mean both higher volatility and a greater risk of loss to the Fund than investing in more developed markets.Changes in currency exchange rates may cause the value of your investment and any income from it to rise or fall.Measures designed to reduce the impact of certain risks may not be available or may be ineffective.Leverage arises from entering into contracts or derivatives whose terms have the effect of magnifying an outcome, meaning profits and losses from investment can be greater.Any security could become hard to value or to sell at a desired time and price, increasing the risk of investment losses.
