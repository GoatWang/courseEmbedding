Securities Litigation & Investor Protection 





Countrywide Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) Litigation











On December 5, 2013 the Court granted final approval of a $500 million landmark, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) class action litigation against Countrywide Financial Corporation and others, led by Lead Plaintiff, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS).  It is the nation’s largest MBS-federal securities class action settlement.  The settlement brings to a close the consolidated class action lawsuit brought in 2010 by multiple retirement funds against Countrywide and other defendants for securities violations involving the packaging and sale of MBS. Bank of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. 
In addition to the Lead Plaintiff, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System, Orange County Employees’ Retirement System (“OCERS”), the State of Oregon, by and through the Oregon State Treasurer and the Oregon Public Employee Retirement Board on behalf of the Oregon Public Employee Retirement Fund (“Oregon”) and the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits of the United Methodist Church (“the General Board”),  all were appointed class representatives and Cohen Milstein was appointed Class Counsel in the litigation in October 2011. 
Case Background
On April 17, 2013, Plaintiffs in the landmark mortgage-backed securities (MBS) class action litigation against Countrywide Financial Corporation and others, led by Lead Plaintiff, the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS), agreed to a $500 million settlement. 
If approved by the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California, the settlement will bring to a close the consolidated class action lawsuit brought in 2010 by multiple retirement funds against Countrywide and other defendants for securities violations involving the packaging and sale of MBS. Bank of America acquired Countrywide in 2008.
On May 14, 2010, Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer of the United States District Court for the Central District of California appointed Cohen Milstein lead counsel in the securities litigation case pending against Countrywide Financial Corporation.  Cohen Milstein's client, the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System (IPERS), was appointed lead plaintiff.
You can view a copy of the Order here and to the left under "Case Documents".
Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC (“Cohen Milstein”) announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of purchasers of certain mortgage-backed securities sponsored by affiliates of Countrywide Financial Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (collectively, “Countrywide”) and related trusts (the “Issuing Trusts”), issued between 2005 and 2007. The case has been assigned a civil action number of 10-cv-00302-SJO-PJW and is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
You can view a copy of the Complaint here and to the left under "Case Documents". 
The Complaint alleges claims under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) as a class action on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the following certificates (the “Class” or “Plaintiffs”): Alternative Loan Trust Certificates issued by CWALT, Inc. (“CWALT”); CWABS Asset-Backed Trust Certificates issued by CWABS, Inc. (“CWABS”); CHL Mortgage Pass-Through Trust Certificates issued in 2005 and 2006 by CWMBS, Inc. (“CWMBS”); and CWHEQ Revolving Home Equity Loan Trusts and Home Equity Loan Trusts issued by CWHEQ, Inc. (“CWHEQ”) (collectively referred to as the “Certificates”).  
The Complaint alleges that defendants issued the Certificates pursuant or traceable to certain registration statements (the “Registration Statements”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  The Certificates were then sold to Class members pursuant to certain prospectuses (the “Prospectus Supplements”), which also were filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statements. 
The Complaint charges that the Registration Statements and Prospectus Supplements issued in connection with the Certificates contained materially false and misleading statements and omitted material information in violation of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act.  
Specifically, the Complaint charges that Countrywide, certain officers and directors of CWALT, CWABS, CWMBS and CWHEQ, and certain investment banks, which served as underwriters of the Certificates, violated the Securities Act by issuing the Certificates pursuant to Registration Statements and Prospectus Supplements that misstated and omitted material information regarding, inter alia, the process used to originate and the quality of mortgages that were pooled in the Issuing Trusts and were used as the financial basis for the Certificates.  For example, the Complaint alleges that Countrywide did not follow the underwriting and appraisal standards described in the Registration Statements and Prospectus Supplements.  Indeed, Countrywide issued mortgages to borrowers that did not satisfy the requisite eligibility criteria as described in the Registration Statements and Prospectus Supplements.  Likewise, the mortgages held by the Issuing Trusts and underlying the Certificates were based on collateral appraisals that overstated the value of the underlying properties, thus exposing the Issuing Trusts and Class members to losses in the event of foreclosure.  As a result of the material misrepresentations and omissions in the Registration Statements and Prospectus Supplements, investors purchased securities that were far riskier than represented.  
According to the Complaint, by mid-2007 the mortgages held by the Issuing Trusts and underlying the Certificates began suffering accelerating delinquencies and defaults. The defaults led to real estate foreclosures, which revealed that the properties underlying the mortgages were worth materially less than the loans issued to the borrowers, and the borrowers did not have sufficient financial wherewithal to cover the outstanding mortgage balances.  The representations made in the Prospectus Supplements were materially false and misleading because at the time of the Certificates offerings, Countrywide’s underwriting standards were not designed to evaluate a borrower’s ability to repay or the true value of the mortgaged property underlying the Certificates.  These adverse factors were not revealed and/or adequately addressed in the offering documents.  Had Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class known the truth, they would not have purchased the Certificates, or they would not have purchased them at the inflated prices that were paid.  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of the Certificates issued between 2005 and 2007.
Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC has significant experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions involving securities fraud.  The firm has offices in Washington, D.C., New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and is active in major litigation pending in federal and state courts throughout the nation.  
The firm’s reputation for excellence has been recognized on repeated occasions by courts which have appointed the firm to lead positions in complex multi-district or consolidated litigation.  Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC has taken a lead role in numerous important cases on behalf of defrauded investors, and has been responsible for a number of outstanding recoveries which, in the aggregate, total in the billions of dollars.

An assignment agreement is a document used to assign rights and responsibilities to a party. If a party (''assignor'') is overwhelmed with work, and can not adequately fill their responsibilities to an individual or company (''obligor''), they can assign them to a third party (''assignee'').

These documents may include debt assignment as well. The agreement details the rights and obligations for each party, and the terms under which the agreement was made. It may also include the consent and release by the parties, any changes made to the obligations of the assigning party, governing law, information about the scope of authority the new party receives, and other issues.

You might use an assignment agreement if you were hired to provide a service to a business, such as web design, and due to extenuating circumstances, you were unable to perform the obligations you assumed. You would perhaps choose to hire a subcontractor to fulfill your responsibilities, upon consent of the obligated party.

ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT



ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of March 30, 2007 ("Assignment Agreement"),
among COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC. ("Assignor"), THE BANK OF NEW YORK
("Assignee"), not in its individual or corporate capacity, but solely as
Corridor Contract Administrator for CWHEQ Home Equity Loan Trust, Series
2007-S3, pursuant to a Corridor Contract Administration Agreement (the
"Corridor Contract Administration Agreement") dated as of March 30, 2007, and

BEAR STEARNS FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC. ("Remaining Party").



W I T N E S S E T H:



WHEREAS, effective as of March 30, 2007, Assignor desires to assign all of
its rights and delegate all of its duties and obligations to Assignee under a
certain Transaction (the "Assigned Transaction") as evidenced by a Confirmation
with a Trade Date of March 27, 2007, whose BEAR STEARNS FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC.
reference number is FXNEC9369, (the "Confirmation"), a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit I;


WHEREAS, Assignor and Remaining Party executed and delivered the
Confirmation in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency--Cross
Border) form (the "ISDA Form Master Agreement");


WHEREAS, Assignee desires to accept the assignment of rights and assume
the delegation of duties and obligations of the Assignor under the Assigned
Transaction and the Confirmation, including any modifications that may be
agreed to by Assignee and Remaining Party; and


WHEREAS, Assignor desires to obtain the written consent of Remaining Party
to the assignment, delegation, and assumption and Remaining Party desires to
grant such consent in accordance with the terms hereof;


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
agreements herein contained and for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:


1. Assignment and Assumption. Effective as of and from March 30, 2007 (the
"Effective Date"), Assignor hereby assigns all of its rights and delegates all
of its duties and obligations to Assignee and Assignee hereby assumes all
Assignor's rights, duties, and obligations under the Assigned Transaction and
the Confirmation arising on or after the Effective Date.


2. Release. Effective as of and from the Effective Date, Remaining Party
and Assignor hereby release one another from all duties and obligations owed
under and in respect of the Assigned Transaction and the Confirmation, and
Assignor hereby terminates its rights under and in respect of the Assigned
Transaction; provided, that such release shall not affect Assignor's obligation
to pay the Fixed Amount in accordance with the terms of the Assigned
Transaction and the Confirmation.





3. Limitation on Liability. Assignor and Remaining Party agree to the
following: (a) The Bank of New York ("BNY") is entering into this Assignment
Agreement solely in its capacity as Corridor Contract Administrator under the
Corridor Contract Administration Agreement; and (b) in no case shall BNY (or
any person acting as successor Corridor Contract Administrator under the
Corridor Contract Administration Agreement) be personally liable for or on
account of any of the statements, representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations stated to be those of Assignee under the terms of the Assigned
Transaction, all such liability, if any, being expressly waived by Assignor and
Remaining Party and any person claiming by, through or under either such party.


4. Consent and Acknowledgment of Remaining Party. Remaining Party hereby
consents to the assignment and delegation by Assignor to Assignee of all the
rights, duties, and obligations of Assignor under the Assigned Transaction
pursuant to this Assignment Agreement.


5. Governing Agreement. The Assigned Transaction and the Confirmation
shall form a part of, and be subject to, the ISDA Form Master Agreement, as if
Assignee and Remaining Party had executed such agreement on the trade date of
the Transaction (the "Assignee Agreement"). The Confirmation, together with all
other documents referring to the ISDA Form Master Agreement confirming the
transaction entered into between Assignee and Remaining Party, shall form a
part of, and be subject to, the Assignee Agreement. For the purposes of this
paragraph, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings assigned in the ISDA Form Master Agreement.


6. Additional Provision. Each party hereby agrees that the Confirmation
and thus the Assigned Transaction are each hereby amended as follows:


(a)  The following additional provision shall be added as a new

Section 6:


"Regulation AB Compliance. BSFP and Counterparty agree that the
terms of the Item 1115 Agreement dated as of January 30, 2006
(the "Regulation AB Agreement"), between Countrywide Home Loans,
Inc., CWABS, INC., CWMBS, Inc., CWALT, Inc., CWHEQ, Inc. and
Bear Stearns Financial Products Inc. shall be incorporated by
reference into this Agreement so that Counterparty shall be an
express third party beneficiary of the Regulation AB Agreement.
A copy of the Regulation AB Agreement is attached hereto as
Annex A."


7. Representations. Each party hereby represents and warrants to the other
parties as follows:


(a)  It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation;


(b)  It has the power to execute and deliver this Assignment Agreement;

that no event or condition has occurred that constitutes an Event of Default, a
Potential Event of Default or, to the party's knowledge, a Termination Event
(as such terms are defined in the Confirmation and Assignee Agreement), with
respect to the party, and no such event would occur as a result of the party's
entering into or performing its obligations under this Assignment Agreement.


8. Indemnity. Each of Assignor and Remaining Party hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Assignee with respect to any and all claims arising
under the Assigned Transaction prior to the Effective Date. Each of Assignee
and Remaining Party (subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph 3 above)
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Assignor with respect to any and

5





(b)   (i)   Any failure by the Counterparty to deliver any information,
report, certification, accountants' consent or other
material when and as required under Section 2 or any breach
by the Counterparty of a representation or warranty set
forth in Section 3 and made as of a date prior to the
Closing Date, to the extent that such breach is not cured by
the Closing Date (or in the case of information needed for
purposes of printing the Prospectus Supplement, the date of
printing of the Prospectus Supplement), or any breach by the
Counterparty of a representation or warranty pursuant to

Section 3 to the extent made as of a date subsequent to such
closing date, shall, except as provided in clause (ii) of
this paragraph, immediately and automatically, without
notice or grace period, constitute an Additional Termination
Event (as defined in the Master Agreement) with the
Counterparty as the sole Affected Party (as defined in the
Master Agreement) under the Derivative Agreement. Following
such termination, a termination payment (if any) shall be
payable by the applicable party as determined by the
application of Section 6(e)(ii) of the Master Agreement,
with Market Quotation and Second Method being the applicable
method for determining the termination payment
(notwithstanding anything in the Derivative Agreement to the
contrary).


(ii)  If the Counterparty has failed to deliver any information,
report, certification or accountants' consent when and as
required under Section 2, which continues unremedied for the
lesser of ten calendar days after the date on which such
information, report, certification or accountants' consent
was required to be delivered or such period in which the
applicable Exchange Act Report for which such information is
required can be timely filed (without taking into account
any extensions permitted to be filed), and the Counterparty
has not, at its own cost, within the period in which the
applicable Exchange Act Report for which such information is
required can be timely filed caused another entity (which
meets any ratings related requirement of the applicable
rating agencies at such time) to replace the Counterparty as
party to the Derivative Agreement that (i) has signed an
agreement with CHL and the Depositors substantially in the
form of this Agreement, (ii) has agreed to deliver any
information, report, certification or accountants' consent
when and as required under Section 2 hereof and (iii) is
approved by the Depositor (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and which approval is not needed if
such assignment is to a subsidiary of The Bear Stearns
Companies, Inc., provided the Depositor is given notice) and
any rating agency, if applicable, on terms substantially
similar to the Derivative Agreement, then an Additional
Termination Event (as defined in the Master Agreement) shall
have occurred with the Counterparty as the sole Affected
Party. Following such termination, a termination payment (if
any) shall be payable by the applicable party as determined
by the application of Section 6(e)(ii) of the Master
Agreement, with Market Quotation and Second Method being the
applicable method for


6





determining the termination payment (notwithstanding
anything in the Derivative Agreement to the contrary).


(iii) In the event that the Counterparty or the SPV has found a
replacement entity in accordance with Section 2(b)(ii), the
Counterparty shall promptly reimburse the SPV for all
reasonable incidental expenses incurred by the SPV, as such
are incurred, in connection with the termination of the
Counterparty as counterparty and the entry into a new
Derivative Instrument. The provisions of this paragraph
shall not limit whatever rights the SPV may have under other
provisions of this Agreement or otherwise, whether in equity
or at law, such as an action for damages, specific
performance or injunctive relief.
