Thruster Configurations

Best of both worlds with the addition of a lateral thruster


5

Five thrusters
Full symmetric power on all directions









Professional Capabilities



High Resolution 1200 HTVL video feed overlaid with useful data including depth, compass heading, pitch, water temperature, and other system status all packaged in a compact control console unique among mini ROVs. Autopilot functions like autodepth and autoheading also comes standard.









High Definition



ROVEEE comes standard with a unique remotely-tiltable mount for your GoPro HD camera that allows you to record in stunning HD everything the main camera is looking at, and allows your GoPro to tilt in sync with the main camera, ensuring you will not miss that important detail your client expects to see.
A 300 meters depth-rated 4K HD Camera powered by GoPro is an option
(see Shop section)









Toughest Chassis from Solid Alloy



This Unistructure™  chassis is precision machined from a solid block of very hard aluminum alloy. This multi-functional part is ROVEEE’s main structural element and, at the same time, protects and supports all electronics and other active components -- minimizing weight and maximizing rigidity. Power supplies, sensors, tilting mechanisms, and fixed lighting are all protected by this lightweight yet very strong and rigid enclosure -- fully oil-compensated for pressure tolerance and ultra-efficient cooling. This Unistructure™ ensures your ROVEEE survives where others cant so you can finish the job on time and on budget.










Reliable Vectorable Thruster



This Vectorable Thruster is brushless, gearless, and fully oil compensated. ROVEEE’s unique thruster design integrates all the latest propulsion technologies, packed into the most compact thruster in its class. Its short length enabled by advanced technology allows it to be vectorable from 15 up to 30 degrees without sticking out of the protective ROV frame ­­allowing the user to direct power where it is needed: less vector for more pulling power, more vector for greater maneuverability. Construction is top quality all-metal 2­-piece machined aluminum alloy casing. It’s made to be tough and dependable.
