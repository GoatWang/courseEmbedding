Early life and career[edit]
He grew up in Miami, Florida, of Italian born parents, and graduated from Miami High School.[1] He received a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, Amelio was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.
Amelio joined Bell Labs as a researcher in 1968.[2] In 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).[3] He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s,[4] and in 1977 became head of the MOS division. He worked his way up to president of the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and then its communications systems division.[5]
Amelio joined National Semiconductor as president and chief executive in February 1991.[5]
Apple Computer[edit]
In 1994 Amelio joined the board of directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor, Amelio became Apple CEO on February 2, 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. [6] He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section "Certain Transactions" in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.[7]
Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $429 million.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs.[8] Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. In a 2007 interview with technology journalist Gina Smith, Jobs quoted Amelio as having a saying:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.[9][10][11]

It was reported that Amelio's contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.[12]
Post-Apple career[edit]
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell.[13] He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.[14]
In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.[15][16][17] Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.[18][19][20]
Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. Amelio was director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni.[citation needed] In October 2005 Amelio joined the board of advisors to Vanguard PAC (now TheVanguard.Org).[21] Amelio is also a member of the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless R&D company. Gil Amelio is on the advisory board of tech start-up Intelicloud.[22]
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow.[23] He has been awarded 16 patents.[citation needed] He is the author of three books: An American Imperative (1993),[citation needed] Profit from Experience (1995, ISBN 978-0471287049) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998, ISBN 978-0887309199).

Early life and career[edit]
He grew up in Miami, Florida, of Italian born parents, and graduated from Miami High School.[1] He received a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, Amelio was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.
Amelio joined Bell Labs as a researcher in 1968.[2] In 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).[3] He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s,[4] and in 1977 became head of the MOS division. He worked his way up to president of the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and then its communications systems division.[5]
Amelio joined National Semiconductor as president and chief executive in February 1991.[5]
Apple Computer[edit]
In 1994 Amelio joined the board of directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor, Amelio became Apple CEO on February 2, 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. [6] He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section "Certain Transactions" in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.[7]
Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $429 million.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs.[8] Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. In a 2007 interview with technology journalist Gina Smith, Jobs quoted Amelio as having a saying:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.[9][10][11]

It was reported that Amelio's contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.[12]
Post-Apple career[edit]
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell.[13] He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.[14]
In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.[15][16][17] Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.[18][19][20]
Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. Amelio was director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni.[citation needed] In October 2005 Amelio joined the board of advisors to Vanguard PAC (now TheVanguard.Org).[21] Amelio is also a member of the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless R&D company. Gil Amelio is on the advisory board of tech start-up Intelicloud.[22]
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow.[23] He has been awarded 16 patents.[citation needed] He is the author of three books: An American Imperative (1993),[citation needed] Profit from Experience (1995, ISBN 978-0471287049) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998, ISBN 978-0887309199).

Resignation Agreement - Apple Computer Inc. and Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio








                                  September 22, 1997
                                           
                                           
                                           
Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio
Apple Computer, Inc.
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, California  95014

                                RESIGNATION AGREEMENT
                                           
Dear Dr. Amelio:

    This will reflect our agreement concerning your resignation as a director,
officer and employee of Apple Computer, Inc. (the 'Company') and each of its
direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the
'Companies'), in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below.

    1.   RESIGNATION.  By signing this Resignation Agreement, you (i) hereby
confirm your resignation as a director and officer of each of the Companies,
effective as of July 8, 1997 (the 'Director and Officer Resignation Date') and
(ii) hereby agree that the date of your resignation as an employee of each of
the Companies shall be September 27, 1997 (the 'Employee Resignation Date').

    2.   TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS.  As of the date of
this Resignation Agreement first set forth above (the 'Effective Date'), this
Resignation Agreement supersedes and replaces any written or oral agreements or
understandings between you and any of the Companies, and any of their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates, including,
without limitation, the Employment Agreement between you and the Company dated
February 28, 1996, as amended May 1, 1997 (the 'Employment Agreement'), and each
such agreement or understanding (including, without limitation, the Employment
Agreement) is hereby void and of no further force and effect.

    3.   INTERIM PERIOD.  During the period beginning on the Director and
Officer Resignation Date and ending on the Employee Resignation Date (the
'Interim Period'), you will continue to be eligible to receive your base salary
(at the annual rate in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date) and to
participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan and all pension and
welfare plans (including but not limited to the 401(k) Plan) in accordance with
the terms and provisions applicable to you immediately prior to the Director and
Officer Resignation Date, and you agree to take all accrued unused vacation. 
During the period through August 15, 1997, you were entitled to office space 
from the Company.  You shall be entitled to secretarial support from the Company
until the Employee Resignation Date.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, you shall cease, as of the Director and Officer Resignation Date, to be
eligible to receive any annual or long-term incentive compensation and benefits
from any of the Companies with respect to periods prior to, on or following the
Director and Officer Resignation Date.

    4.   PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR RESIGNATION.  Subject to
Sections 6, 9 and 10 below, the Company agrees to pay or to provide you with the
compensation and benefits described below in connection with your resignation of
employment:

         (a)  As soon as reasonably practicable following the date which is the
later of (i) the Expiration of the Revocation Period (as such phrase is defined
in Section 10 below) (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the
expiration of such period) or (ii) the perfection of the security interest for
the Loan as described in Section 4(g) (but in no event later than thirty (30)
days following the expiration of such period), the Company will make a one-time
lump sum cash payment to you of Six Million Seven Hundred Thirty-One Thousand
Eight Hundred Seventy Dollars and Ninety-Six Cents ($6,731,870.96), less
applicable withholding taxes.  The Company will deduct from this payment the sum
of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) as a partial repayment
of the 




balance of the Loan (as defined in Section 4(g) below) as of the date on which
such payment is made to you; the amount will be applied first to accrued
interest on the Loan as of such date, and the balance of said amount shall be
applied to the then remaining principal balance on the Loan.

         (b)  As soon as practicable following  the date which is the later of
(i) the Expiration of the Revocation Period (but in no event later than thirty
(30) days following the expiration of such period) or (ii) the perfection of the
security interest for the Loan as described in Section 4(g) (but in no event
later than thirty (30) days following the expiration of such period), you shall
receive an additional payment from the Company in the amount of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000), less applicable withholding taxes, representing the
Component B Bonus (as defined in the Employment Agreement) for the fiscal year
of the Company ending September 27, 1997 (the '1997 Fiscal Year').

         (c)  You acknowledge that, as of the Director and Officer Resignation
Date, you were a participant in the Company's Senior Officers Restricted Share
Plan (the 'SORP').  You shall be eligible for an award of performance shares
under the SORP for the 1997 Fiscal Year, subject to the Company achieving the
applicable performance goals and targets established for that year.  A copy of
said goals and targets is attached hereto as EXHIBIT A.  The actual number of
performance shares and cash amount, if any, awarded to you for the 1997 Fiscal
Year will be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon the goals and
targets for that year, and the percentage of your target award paid to you will
be the same percentage paid to other senior officers of the Company who were
participants in the SORP for the entire 1997 Fiscal Year.  The performance
shares and cash amounts, if any, payable to you under the SORP for the 1997
Fiscal Year shall be payable to you at the same time as payments are made to
other SORP participants.  Except as provided in this Section 4(c), no other
amounts shall be payable to you under the SORP.  

         (d)  On the Employee Resignation Date, the Company will pay you any
accrued but unpaid salary you have earned through such date.

         (e)  During the Benefit Continuation Period (as hereinafter defined),
you and your eligible dependents shall continue to be eligible to participate in
the medical, dental and health insurance plans applicable to you immediately
prior to the Employee Resignation Date on the same terms and conditions in
effect for you and your dependents immediately prior to the Employee Resignation
Date, or equivalent coverage obtained by the Company.  For purposes of the
previous sentence, 'Benefit Continuation Period' means the period beginning on
the Employee Resignation Date and ending on the earliest to occur of (i) the
date you revoke the Release (as defined in Section 9 below), (ii) the Employee
Resignation Date (if you fail to execute the Release), or (iii) February 2,
2001; provided, however, that your coverage under such plans and arrangements
shall end on the date that you are eligible for comparable coverage under the
plan of a subsequent employer.  Following the end of the Benefit Continuation
Period, you shall be eligible to elect any applicable 'continuation coverage'
under Section 4980B(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as if
the last day of the Benefit Continuation Period were the date of your
'qualifying event' for such continuation coverage.

         (f)  Following the Expiration of the Revocation Period, you shall be
entitled to keep any of the Company computer and software products in your
office or made available to you at your home for business use as listed in
EXHIBIT B; provided, however, that you agree to delete from such products all
confidential and propriety information of the Companies.  During the Benefit
Continuation Period, you shall continue to be eligible to purchase Company
products for your personal use at the discounted price then offered to employees
of the Company; provided, however, you shall be precluded from purchasing at a
discounted price any more than ten (10) comparable items in any twelve- (12)
month period.  In addition, the Company will deliver one 'Spartacus' unit to you
within ninety (90) days of the date on which such product becomes available on
the commercial market.

         (g)  In consideration of your execution and delivery of the Release,
the Company hereby agrees to extend the maturity date of the loan made to you
pursuant to Section 3(c) of the Employment Agreement (the 'Loan') until
September 15, 1998, whereupon the then entire outstanding principal amount
thereof, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, shall be payable in
full; provided, 




however, that, if you fail to execute the Release or if you revoke the Release,
then the Loan shall be immediately due and payable as of the Employee
Resignation Date.  The Loan shall be fully recourse to you and shall be secured
by your residence in Lake Tahoe ('Stonewood'), which you have represented to the
Company as having a current fair market value of approximately Six Million
Dollars ($6,000,000) to Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000).  You hereby agree to
execute such documents and to take such further actions as the Company may deem
necessary or advisable to effect and to perfect such security interest. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the promissory note representing the Loan, you
expressly acknowledge and agree that, as of the Employee Termination Date, the
Loan shall bear interest at the rate of seven percent (7%) per annum. You may
prepay some or all of the principal amount of the Loan, and any portion of the
accrued but unpaid interest on the Loan, at any time, without premium or
penalty. The Company may reduce or set off against any amounts that the Company
owes to you any amounts currently due and payable by you under the Loan.

         (h)  Any stock options granted to you pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, the Apple Computer, Inc. 1990 Stock Option Plan, or other plan or
program which are vested by their terms as of the Employee Resignation Date
shall remain exercisable for ninety (90) days following the Employee Resignation
Date.  Upon expiration of such ninety- (90) day period, such vested options
shall expire and be of no further force or effect, to the extent not previously
exercised.  Any unvested portion of the options so granted will be forfeited as
of the Employee Resignation Date.  As of the Director and Officer Resignation
Date, you shall not be eligible to participate in any option repricing or
exchange program announced by the Company and you hereby irrevocably waive any
right to participate in any such program.

         (i)  The Company shall have no obligation to make any payments to you
with respect to your airplane, whether pursuant to the airplane use arrangement
referred to in Section 3(f) of the Employment Agreement or otherwise, for any
period on and after the Director and Officer Resignation Date.

    5.   NO OTHER SEVERANCE, PAYMENTS OR BENEFITS.  Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, you hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not
entitled to any other compensation or benefits from any of the Companies or any
of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents or
affiliates in connection with your resignation of employment or otherwise and
that, except as expressly set forth herein, you are not entitled to any
severance or similar benefits under any plan, program, policy or arrangement,
whether formal or informal, written or unwritten, of any of the Companies or any
of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents or
affiliates.

    6.   PROTECTION OF THE COMPANY'S INTERESTS.

         (a)  On the Employee Resignation Date, you shall return to the Company
all property of the Companies then in your possession and all property made
available to you in connection with your service to any of the Companies, other
than property described in Section 4(f), including, without limitation, your
Company credit cards, and all records, drawings, manuals, reports, papers and
documents kept or made by you in connection with your employment as a director,
officer or employee of any of the Companies, including any files, memoranda,
correspondence, vendor and customer lists, financial data, keys and security
access cards, and any other materials or documents described in Section 6(c)
below.

         (b)  You shall keep the terms of this Resignation Agreement and all
communications with any of the Companies and its counsel regarding the same
confidential.

         (c)  You will not, at any time, directly or indirectly divulge or
disclose to any person, firm, association or corporation, or use for your own
benefit, gain or otherwise, any confidential or proprietary plans, products,
customer lists, trade secrets, technical or business materials, or information
of any of the Companies or in the possession of any of the Companies, including
any or all information or instructions, technical or otherwise, issued or
proclaimed for the sole use of the Companies, or any confidential information
that was disclosed to you or in any way acquired by you during your employment
with any of the Companies.




         (d)  During the period beginning on the Director and Officer
Resignation Date and ending on the date which is twelve (12) months after the
Employee Resignation Date, you shall not, whether for your own account or for
the account of any other individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other
business organization (other than the Company), intentionally solicit, endeavor
to entice away from any of the Companies, or otherwise interfere with the
relationship of any of the Companies with any person with a base salary of at
least Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) per year who is employed by or
otherwise engaged to perform services for any of the Companies.

         (e)  If you breach in any material respect the provisions of this
Section 6, you shall immediately forfeit any and all rights to future payments
or benefits under Sections 3 and 4 above.

    7.   COOPERATION.  You agree that you will make yourself available at
reasonable times and intervals to participate in the conduct of and preparation
for any pending or future litigation to which any of the Companies is a party
and in which your experience or knowledge may be relevant.  You shall be
reimbursed for your reasonable travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
virtue of your cooperation as described in this Section 7.  If such cooperation
takes more than twenty (20) hours, the Company agrees to reimburse you, at the
rate of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per hour, for time spent in excess of
twenty (20) hours.  In no event shall this provision be deemed to pertain to or
affect the nature or substance of employee testimony at deposition or trial or
in any other truthful testimony at deposition or trial or in any other
circumstances or your obligation to give such testimony.

    8.   ACKNOWLEDGMENT.  By signing this Resignation Agreement, you hereby
acknowledge and confirm the following:

         (a)  You were advised by the Company in connection with your
resignation to consult with an attorney of your choice prior to signing this
Resignation Agreement and the Release and to have such attorney explain to you
the terms of this Resignation Agreement and the Release including, without
limitation, the terms relating to your release of claims arising under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.

         (b)  You were given not less than twenty-one (21) days to consider the
terms of this Resignation Agreement and the Release and to consult with an
attorney of your choosing with respect thereto and that, for a period of seven
(7) days following your execution of the Release, you have the right to revoke
the Release in accordance with the terms set forth below.

    9.   RELEASE.  You agree to execute and deliver to the Company a release in
the form of EXHIBIT C attached hereto (the 'Release') on the Employee
Resignation Date.  If you do not deliver the Release to the Company on the
Employee Resignation Date, or if you subsequently revoke the Release in the
manner contemplated by Section 10 below, the Company will have no obligation to
pay or provide you with any of the payments or benefits contemplated by Sections
3 and 4 above.

    10.  REVOCATION.  You shall have the right to revoke the Release during the
seven- (7) day period (the 'Revocation Period') commencing immediately following
the date you sign and deliver the Release to the Company.  The Revocation Period
shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on the seventh day immediately
following the date that the Release is executed by you; provided, however, that
if such seventh day is not a business day, then the Revocation Period shall
extend to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on the next succeeding business day.  No such
revocation by you shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by you,
and received by the Company prior to the Expiration of the Revocation Period. 
For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase 'Expiration of the Revocation Period'
shall mean the expiration of the Revocation Period without your having revoked
the Release in accordance with this Section 10.

    11.  ACCEPTANCE.  You may indicate your acceptance of this Agreement by
signing and dating both counterparts of this Agreement and delivering one such
copy to the Company by no later than 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on September 26,
1997.  This offer shall expire without further action by the Company if a signed
and dated counterpart of this Agreement is not returned to the Company by the
time and date set forth above.




    12.  TAX CONSIDERATIONS.  Any payments made to you under this Resignation
Agreement shall be reduced by the full amount legally required to be withheld
for federal, state or local tax purposes by the Company.

Career

Advertisements

1970–1979: CCDs at Bell Labs and Faircild
At Bell Labs in 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).[1] He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s, and in 1977 became head of the MOS division.
1979–1991: Rockwell
1991–1995: National Semiconductor
Amelio was CEO of National Semiconductor from 1991 to 1995.
1994–1997: Apple Computer
In 1994 Amelio joined the Board of Directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor Amelio became Apple CEO on 2 February 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section "Certain Transactions" in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.
Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $200 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $125 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on 4 February 1997 for $429 million. NeXT's operating system became the basis for Mac OS X. Amelio later stated he felt he'd overpaid for NeXT.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12 year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on 26 June by an anonymous party. Apple lost another $708 million; however, they did report a $25 million dollar profit prior to Amelio leaving. Apple had a multi-billion dollar loss the year before. On the 4 July 1997 weekend Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on 16 September. In 2007, Jobs summed up his predecessor's tenure with a quote that he attributed to Amelio:

"Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, and my job is to point the ship in the right direction"[2][3]

1998–present: after Apple
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist focusing on early-stage startups. He is currently Senior Partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California, and CEO of Acquicor, a company he co-founded with Ellen Hancock and Steve Wozniak. Acquicor completed the acquisition of Jazz Semiconductor in Newport Beach, CA in early 2007 and has since been granted SEC approval.
In February 2001 Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell. SpectruCell supports multiple protocols and is software upgradeable, which has been characterised as a big boon to the cell phone market.[4]
Amelio is a former director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association and since 1996 has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. He is a current or past director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named Chairman of the Board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, ex-CTO Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni. In Oct 2005 he joined the Board of Advisors to Vanguard PAC, now TheVanguard.Org.[5] Dr. Gil Amelio has joined, is currently mentoring and on the Advisory board of a new company that bills itself as "The next generation data center technology" the InteliCloud 360. A tightly integrated Net Work in a Box.(see intelicloud)
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow, has been awarded 16 patents, and is the author of three books, An American Imperative (1993), Profit from Experience (1995) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998), the latter two of which were business best sellers.

Apple History | Low End Mac The Rise and Fall of Apple’s Gil Amelio

Tom Hormby - 2013.08.10 


Gil Amelio was unlike any Apple CEO since the days of Mike Scott, a former Fairchild executive. Amelio was from National Semiconductor, an outside company where he made a name for himself as a turnaround artist.
As CEO of National Semiconductor, he transformed the company from an unreliable third tier chip producer into a respected front runner in the industry. Before he entered management, he was a successful researcher with a PhD. Along with a coworker, he invented the CCD, the basis of all scanners, camcorders, and digital cameras.
In 1994, National Semiconductor was a huge supplier to Apple, so Amelio was not surprised to be approached by the headhunting firm, Heidrich & Struggles, to join the Apple board of directors. In earlier days, such an appointment would have scandalized the industry as a major conflict of interest, but during the tech boom it was common practice for major suppliers to help oversee the companies they supplied.
Spindler’s Last Gasp
After several months of uncertainty, Amelio was formally invited to join the board of directors by Apple cofounder Mike Markkula. He gladly accepted. His first board meeting took place in New York at a swank nineteenth-century club.
A shadow of things to come appeared shortly after Amelio took his place on the board of directors. Steve Jobs left a cryptic voicemail: “I want to come over and see you.” Amelio reasoned that he owed it to the cofounder of the company he now helped oversee to indulge this request, so he scheduled a meeting.
After a brief period of small talk, Jobs launched into a monologue on how only he could rally the troops at Apple and save the company from acquisition. Amelio was fascinated and pressed him to elaborate on his plans for the company, but he received only sweeping statements with few details.
The meeting concluded, and Amelio refused to lend Jobs his support. He had no idea that in a little more than five hundred days, Jobs would wrest control of Apple from him in a dramatic coup.
Unfazed by his meeting with Jobs, Amelio finished his day and returned to his Palo Alto home, where he shared the bizarre incident with his wife, Charlene.
Amelio was shocked by the lack of control Apple’s board exercised over the company. The board of directors was hardly fulfilling its role, in his eyes. The body rarely questioned the CEO, Michael Spindler, and did little research to discover the underlying problems at Apple.
Spindler’s Demise
Instead, senior executives would paint glowing pictures of blooming sales figures and successful product launches at every board meeting, despite the fact that Spindler’s strategy of flooding the market with cheap Macs was clearly hurting Apple’s bottom line, and, more importantly, alienating important Apple resellers.
As a result of Spindler’s policies, cheap Macs were being displayed just like their still cheaper PC counterparts, hiding the most distinguishing feature of the Mac OS, its ease of use.
Amelio’s second board meeting opened with Spindler announcing, “We’re not making it, the company has to be sold.”
Apple had flirted with several buyouts in its past. Only a few years before, at the end of John Sculley‘s tenure at Apple, a proposed deal with IBM got as far as both companies drafting press releases announcing the deal, but it fell through at the last minute.
Now Apple was looking for a new buyer. Jim Carlton of the Wall Street Journal reported that Gateway 2000 and Sun Microsystems were being considered, but no decision had been made.
Disaster struck Apple during the new fiscal year, which began October 1st. Spindler had been telling the board emphatically that Apple would make around $150 million in profits, but because of his strategy of flooding the market with cheap Macs, Apple would take a staggering loss of over $69 million.
Spindler lashed out at his subordinate, Jim Buckley, the head of Apple Americas, for cutting prices and profit margins too deeply, but it did little good. Even worse, Spindler revealed that Apple had over $1 billion in unsold merchandise in the channel, which was basically worthless and would have the be written off.
Apple had $6 billion in sales, so a full one-sixth of its sales would be canceled by this surplus. The number was staggering, and that was the last straw for the board.
Amelio’s Ascent
Spindler broached the news to the board at their December 1st meeting, and it was not taken well. Still, no one demanded Spindler’s head, nor did they relieve the man blamed for the disaster, Jim Buckley.
Instead, the search for a buyer became even more frenetic. The company’s CFO, Joe Graziano, told the board about ongoing negotiations he had with Sun and then dropped a bombshell: Sun was willing to buy Apple for $23 a share, $8 less than its trading price. The rest of the board was still interested, but the price immediately set off alarms for Amelio, who was certain that such a price would never be accepted by Apple’s shareholders.
Besides that, a simple buyout would not fix any of Apple’s problems – especially if Apple went to Sun, which had no experience in the personal computer market.
Amelio verbally lashed Graziano and the other board members for even considering such a lopsided deal. He woke the group from its apathy, and it became clear that Spindler’s days at the top of Apple were numbered.
After the meeting, Peter Crisp pulled Amelio aside. Crisp was one of Apple’s original shareholders. His Rockefeller-funded VC firm, Venrock, had been Apple’s second outside investor, putting $250,000 into the company. Now one of the most respected board members made a proposal that Amelio could not refuse. Crisp wanted Amelio to become the next CEO of Apple, replacing the flagging Spindler.
Amelio did not give Crisp a definite answer, though he assured Crisp that he would consider the offer. Two days later, Amelio embarked on an eight day tour of the People’s Republic of China as CEO of National Semiconductor. During his trip, the Wall Street Journal published speculation that he would accept the CEO position upon his arrival.
When Amelio returned, he told Crisp that he would consider a switch, but only if it was worth his time. Eventually he was guaranteed a $200,000 raise, stock options, and one million shares outright, though not before the deal was leaked to the media.
Michael Spindler
There was only one problem now: Michael Spindler was still on the job.
A board meeting was called for January 31 in New York, ostensibly to make a final decision on Sun. Apparently oblivious to the fate he was facing, Spindler brought his wife and planned to sightsee with her before the meeting.
Mike Markkula, the chairman, asked Spindler to resign and then allowed him to address the board. Spindler’s statements centered solely on the merger talks, encouraging the board to accept any terms that Sun offered.
The board refused, and Amelio returned to California with Markkula on his personal jet.
A Company in Chaos
Though no contract had been written, Amelio showed up for work the next day. After a fifteen minute search for a parking spot, Amelio entered the headquarters building on Apple’s campus, City Center 3.
Spindler was in the middle of his last meeting, informing his staffers of his fate. For the moment, most of Amelio’s future staff, including the influential administrative assistant, David Seda (who was rumored to issue important commands under the name of Spindler), were occupied helping Spindler clean out his office.
The first day of his 500 day tenure at Apple was spent just getting used to the layout of the building and organizational charts. His Macintosh from National Semiconductor was moved to his office, an obsolete Power Macintosh 8100/110, and hooked to the network.
His first command to his staff was to create a detailed white paper on a new strategy for Apple, one that did not include flooding the market with cheap, unsellable Macs. Unfamiliar with his staff, Amelio snubbed the executive probably best equipped to create such a document and instead hired an outside consultant he knew from his days at Rockwell, Mike Townsend.
The white paper’s conclusion was an about-face from Spindler’s era. Apple would create products with a big profit margin, excellent reliability, and attractive designs. To execute the plan, Apple would have to build up cash reserves, which were rapidly being depleted as Apple lost more and more money.
The paper also suggested selling convertible debentures (a type of bond) for around $500 million. To help the plan along, Amelio hired Fred Anderson as the new CFO to replace Graziano.
Mike Townsend was not the only outsider he brought from National Semiconductor; Ellen Hancock came, too. Hancock had made a name for herself as a senior IBM executive. Amelio met her when National was working on a modem design under contract with IBM.
The original team of executives botched the project and left the company, and IBM refused to pay National’s $5 million cancellation fee. Hancock was brought in to salvage the partnership and succeeded in getting National its promised $5 million. Hancock left IBM for National and, after Amelio left, she jumped ship to Apple, where she became the company’s new CTO.
Early meetings with the top Apple executives shocked Amelio. He had notified them of the meeting weeks in advance, but they hadn’t prepared presentations on their divisions. What little they did say was very positive – and not in sync with a company losing millions of dollars every quarter.
This cemented Amelio’s perception of the company. The Sun acquisition could not be successful if the deep problems in the Apple culture and business plan were not solved. And if Apple couldn’t solve them, no outside party could either.
Amelio broke off negotiations with Sun and put his new strategy to work.
A New Deal for Apple
Amelio started working with Fred Anderson on preparing Apple’s debenture sale. They were working an impossible schedule. Mike Townsend predicted that Apple would be insolvent by April. That left only two months for the sale.
Typically, a company’s senior executive would travel around the country making presentations to possible buyers for about three weeks and then set a deadline for buying about a month after the last presentation. Not only did Amelio not have that kind of time (if Townsend’s predictions were true), he would not be able to leave the company for that long right after he joined it.
Lew Coleman, a consultant at Apple’s financial firm, Goldman Sachs, suggested that Apple sell debentures in less than a day through a conference call shortly after the markets closed on the East Coast. Such a sale was totally unprecedented; no company in America had ever done it, but Coleman was confident.
Amelio took it to the board, where he met opposition. The board stalled the plan for weeks, until late March. Luckily for Amelio and Apple, sales had picked up, so by the time the call was made on June 3, 1995, the company was still solvent, although barely.
The conference call began at 4:00 p.m. For hours, Amelio made a presentation on Apple’s future strategy, and Fred Anderson talked about Apple’s financial status and goals.
After a sleepless night, the Goldman Sachs people closed the deal at 10:00 a.m. Apple had  sold $661 million in debentures, insuring financial solvency until at least 1997.
Quality Control Problems
Even as its short term financial future was secured, Apple was turning out a lot of flawed products. Not only did they have quality issues (almost 10% of all products were repaired or replaced under warranty), but there were major design flaws. The two best known examples are the Performa 6400 and PowerBook 5300.
The 6400 was supposed to be the hub of a family. The computer was powerful, had a large bundle of software, and even had a built-in subwoofer. On top of that, it was packaged in a minitower, Apple’s first consumer desktop in that configuration.
It was built to sell, but there was a major downside. Users could not use an external modem and printer at the same time – there was only one serial port. Such an oversight was baffling to Amelio, but it had not even occurred to the engineers or marketers who created the machine’s specifications.
Quality control was a more sinister problem. Just as Amelio signed on as CEO, Apple was readying a major marketing campaign for the PowerBook 5300 launch. The head of marketing, Satjiv Cahill (who would later take over Palm’s marketing effort) had engineered a campaign around the enormously successful Mission Impossible movie starring Tom Cruise. In the movie, the protagonists all used PowerBook 5300s while the villains used IBM ThinkPads.
Amelio was elated about the campaign and hoped the 5300 would cement Apple’s reputation for fast, expensive, quality computers.
It didn’t. Days before the ship date, notebooks began to explode in the Singapore factory. Amelio hoped that it was only a Singapore issue and shut down the plant, but the same thing started happening at all of Apple’s PowerBook plants. Production was halted, and the 1,000 PowerBook 5300s that had been shipped out were recalled.
A faulty lithium-ion battery from Sony was at fault, but the fiasco tarnished Apple’s image.
A retooled PowerBook was shipped a few weeks later with a different battery, but several notebooks out of every batch failed, so yields were low. The line was chronically sold out, making the expensive marketing campaign almost worthless.
Disheartened, Amelio began reviewing every product under development at Apple. He found a few gems (like the PowerBook 1400 and Power Mac 9600), but most were superfluous and had little hope of ever being released.
The most glaring example was the PowerBook Mercury. Designed for mobile salespeople, the notebook had a detachable display that could be propped on an easel for presentations or held in a hand to read a spec sheet or other document.
The product was cool, but there was a flaw. The logic card, power supply, and battery were all housed in the display, making it almost impossible to use Mercury as a notebook – the computer would dive backwards.
Amelio canceled the project immediately.
Copland
The biggest project at Apple was Copland (see Apple’s Copland Project: An OS for the Common Man). Copland was going to be a highly evolved version of the Mac OS that would be more reliable and much faster, unlike System 7, which performed much worse on PowerPC hardware than IBM’s AIX and OS/2 operating systems.
Copland would not be a total rewrite of the existing Mac OS, so existing applications would not have to be rewritten.
Despite the seemingly narrow focus on the project, it was in deep trouble. Originally slated for release during 1995 – to counter Microsoft’s Windows 95 launch – it was already a year behind, and it was not close to being completed.
Amelio was convinced that even with 500 staffers, the Copland project would never be completed, so he began his search for a new operating system.
The first step was to create a stopgap release of the Mac OS, mainly to satisfy contractual obligations with the clone makers. Nobody was working on creating an update to the Mac OS. The entire division was devoted to Copland, so Amelio created a new group devoted to creating System 8, headed by Steven Glass.
Mac OS 8
Mac OS 8 would include some elements from Copland that were nearly complete, like its themes, Finder, and platinum appearance. Because of the new OS release, Apple was able to renegotiate its contracts with the clone makers, which were encroaching on Apple’s market share instead of bringing new customers to the platform.
In order to counter Power Computing‘s attack on the high-end market with its Power Tower line, Apple created a sliding scale of fees. Now low-end clones cost much less in licensing fees than high-end computers.
Power protested, but there was little they could do.
The Need for a New OS
Amelio’s first two ideas for solving the long term operating system problem involved licensing established workstation-class operating systems from outside company.
The first option he considered was Windows NT. Microsoft already had Windows NT running on PowerPC workstations, so Apple engineers would only have to create a Mac-like interface for the operating system. Not only would it cement Apple’s relationship with Microsoft, but it would validate the Macintosh in the eyes of many business users. If Microsoft endorsed the Mac, surely they could give it a try.
The idea even got as far as Amelio personally calling Bill Gates, who was immediately enamored with the idea. He promised to put hundreds of Microsoft developers on the project and even to port QuickDraw to Windows NT, a task made easier by an earlier project at Apple called Star Trek, which involved ports of QuickDraw and QuickTime to Intel x86 hardware.
There were two big problems. The first was pure public relations: The Mac community was virulently anti-Microsoft, and so was Apple. Secondly, it would take a major rewrite to get Windows NT running on Apple hardware because of the way it stores information in memory.
The other operating system Amelio considered was Solaris. Solaris was based jointly on AT&T Unix and BSD. It was totally multitasking and had protected memory. The downside was the graphics system. It would require total rewrite to get QuickDraw running, and Sun was too small to devote the same resources to the project that Microsoft could.
The existing GUI for Solaris was totally un-Mac-like. The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) was based on X11 and Motif, and it was very ugly. Written in the early nineties when 3D widgets were in vogue (a trend started by NeXTstep), everything looked like it had been chiseled out of granite.
Amelio was convinced that Solaris was unworkable, but Hancock was not so sure. She pressed him to go with Solaris, but he refused.
Plan A Instead of Plan Be
Fate intervened in the person of Jean-Louis Gassée (see How Jean Louis Gassée Changed the Mac’s Direction). Formerly a senior executive at Apple who oversaw the Macintosh after Jobs left, Gassée quit shortly before John Sculley became CEO and took several Apple engineers with him to found Be Inc.
In seven years, Be had no commercial products, but it did have the very respected BeOS, which was still in development. Gassée still had many supporters inside Apple, and when he heard about Apple’s operating system search, he called Amelio and made the proposal.
Amelio had heard about Gassée and was hesitant to do business with him, but he allowed Gassée to make a pitch.
Gassée brought a former Apple engineer, Steve Sakoman (the creator of the Newton project) and a Power Tower Mac clone running BeOS. Amelio was stunned at the speed of BeOS and pleased with the fact that it already ran on Mac hardware.
Still, Gassée was off-putting. When asked for a price for the company, Gassée responded he did not care about money and would let his board set a fair price. Amelio expected around $50 million based on the value of the company, but the board submitted a price in excess of $300 million.
The deal was off, though not before somebody leaked the story to the press.
Despite the failure of the Be proposal, Apple was the subject of many turnaround stories sparked by their successful debenture sale and strong PowerBook 1400 sales. They all reached their apex on August 7, when Amelio was set to deliver the keynote speech at Macworld Boston, his first such show in the US.
The speech was incredibly successful. Over 19,000 watched it live (either in the hall or through closed circuit television), and many others read the beaming accounts in national newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
Amelio expressed his confidence in the company and made two announcements. The first was a 20% price cut on the entire Performa line, putting the low-end Performa 5300 at US$1,499 and the high-end Performa 6500 Avid Edition at $2,499.
The second was an announcement of a $25 million profit for the quarter.
NeXT
NeXT heard about Apple’s operating system search from sources at Apple still loyal to Jobs, and also that the Be deal had fallen through.
During the Macworld conference, a NeXT marketing manager started talking to Hancock about NeXT and Steve Jobs. They scheduled a conference call on November 26 to discuss NeXTstep and Apple.
All of this happened without Steve Jobs’ knowledge. Once he found out, he was thrilled and announced that he had been thinking of Apple as well.
NeXT and Apple started having meetings every day, discussing the technical issues of NeXTstep replacing the Mac OS. Meanwhile, Apple started interviewing hundreds of former NeXT developers, customers, and employees to make sure that NeXT was not a lemon or a fraud. All the checks came back okay, and high level executives began discussing licensing NeXTstep.
Scandal
The press had yet to learn of the Be deal falling through or negotiations with NeXT, and Apple was riding on a tide of good publicity. So was Amelio, until the end of 1996 when a scandal would destroy whatever goodwill he had at Apple or in the industry.
Amelio had long been an avid amateur pilot, and he owned his own private jet that Apple used. Instead of allowing the struggling Apple to use the jet free of charge, Amelio created an independent company, Aero, to manage it and charge Apple for any fuel and maintenance the plane might need during company flights.
The press got ahold of the information and made a huge story of it. Apple was leasing its CEO’s jet for $1,695 an hour, totaling to more than $100,000 a year. Add to that the $5 million loan Apple had made to Amelio when he signed on, and it appeared that Amelio was extorting money from the beleaguered company.
He had never tried to mislead anyone about the deals, but they tarnished his reputation.
A somewhat more humble Gil Amelio scheduled a meeting with Steve Jobs and Jean Louis Gassée on 1996.12.10. Both men would present their solution, and Amelio and his senior executives would make a final decision that day.
Steve Jobs was dazzling. He gave examples of how NeXTstep’s advanced features would be used by Mac users and even had Avi Tevanian with him to talk about the technical aspects of bringing NeXTstep to the Mac.
Gassée’s presentation was hardly a presentation. He thought he already had the deal tied up, so he told Amelio and his team nothing new, pointing out that their engineers had already talked. Amelio was incensed and emphatically sided with NeXT.
At the next board meeting (only days after the shootout), Amelio proposed the NeXT acquisition, and Jobs made a demo of NeXTstep. For the first time in more than 15 years, Jobs and Mike Markkula (who had played a pivotal role in ousting Jobs in 1985) shook hands.
The board was worried about the price of NeXT but gave Amelio authorization to press on with the acquisition. Amelio and Jobs arranged a private meeting to be held at Jobs home.
Jobs’ Return
Jobs had several concerns about the acquisition. The first was his role at the company. He wanted to have some role in the new Apple, and Amelio decided that he would head up the new operating system division. Second, he was skeptical that his other big backers, Ross Perot and Canon, would be willing to sell NeXT to Apple at market price, especially when they had sunk so much money into the money losing company.
The final price was $10 a share – $400 million overall. Amelio defended the seemingly inflated number because not only was Apple buying a complete operating system, but it got Steve Jobs, 300 talented employees, and $50 million a year in revenues from WebObjects and OpenStep.
The large investors would be compensated totally in cash rather than Apple stock. Amelio, however, demanded that Jobs take Apple stock as a vote of confidence in Apple. Amelio managed to talk Jobs into taking 1.5 million shares (which he promised to hold for at least six months) and $120 million in cash.
Jobs would have his revenge on Amelio shortly.
Convincing the board of the deal (and the seemingly inflated price) was difficult, but Amelio pointed out that Apple had no operating system strategy and NeXT was the best option so far. Reluctantly, the board voted to buy NeXT and use NeXTstep as the basis for the next version of the Mac OS.
It would be weeks until the acquisition formally took place, on December 20.
Shortly before the announcement was to be made to the media, Jobs threw Amelio a curve ball. He refused to be the head of engineering. Panicked, Amelio suggested that he be an advisor to the chairman (Mike Markkula), and Jobs agreed.
With this seemingly minor detailed cleared up, Amelio stood before the media and said that Apple had gone with “Plan A instead of Plan Be” (Amelio 201).
Disaster Strikes in San Francisco
The looming Christmas season and following months were disastrous for Amelio.
Macworld San Francisco was coming up, and Apple would unveil its new operating system strategy along with a slew of software demos from third parties.
There would be two celebrity appearances as well: Muhammad Ali would show off his new website for Parkinson’s Disease, and Jeff Goldblum, the star of Independence Day (a movie that inspired a series of Apple ads for the PowerBook 5300 and 1400) would talk about movie production.
There were bad omens from the beginning. Instead of having a speech laid out word for word, Amelio would speak from a detailed outline. According to Amelio, his writer (whose identity has yet to be revealed) was behind schedule and making excuses. Revisions continued to be made up until show time.
To make matters worse, the TelePrompTer malfunctioned, garbling most of the text that had been loaded on it.
The other presenters did not fare so well either. Nobody had told them where they would enter the stage or how to stand so the cameras could pick them up.
Because of the malfunctioning TelePrompTer, Amelio had to ad lib the order of appearances and ended up inadvertently snubbing Muhammad Ali. What was scheduled to last for 1-1/2 hours droned on to three full hours, ruining the finale of Steve Wozniak appearing with Steve Jobs.
Macworld San Francisco was a disaster, and Amelio was in the middle of it. The press had a field day with his poor performance, spawning a new term in Apple parlance, a droneathon. Amelio was embarrassed by his performance and took the blame for it. Only later was it revealed that he was largely a victim of the mistakes of others.
Redemption
The shareholder’s meeting was coming up on February 6, and it wasn’t going to be pretty. The profitable quarter of early fall turned out to be a red herring. The last quarter of 1996 was a disaster. Apple had not lost as much money in a single quarter in its history. Amelio had guaranteed profits just months earlier, at the beginning of his 500 days, yet Apple was still hemorrhaging money.
To keep investor’s minds off the loss, Amelio made sure that every speaker was totally prepared for the presentation, and as a show of good will he had his executives forgo their performance bonuses, which could amount to as much as their ordinary salaries. Amelio brought in an outside adviser, Harold Burson, to help craft the speeches and lessen the impact of the poor results.
The meeting went off without a hitch. Everybody stayed on message, and the event even ended five minutes early. The audience was patient as the executives explained Apple’s long term operating system strategy and details of the NeXT acquisition.
Finally, it came time to vote on Amelio’s contract (a one million share stock options, one million shares outright, and a reduced $600,000 salary), and the investors approved it by a 90% majority. It was a vote of confidence in the flagging CEO.
Mac Linux
It was at this time that Apple assigned its first full time staffers to work on an experimental operating system for Apple, Mk Linux. Conceived as an exercise in microkernel programming and an olive branch to the open source community, Mk Linux was a version of the Linux kernel that ran on top of the Mach microkernel.
In theory, any operating system could be run that way relatively easily. In fact, OS/2 for PowerPC ran the OS/2 kernel on top of a microkernel. Such a project was stunning to the community. Richard Stallman said it “is a pleasant surprise to see Apple support the creation of a free operating system.”
Reorganization
After the meeting, a major reorganization was needed. Amelio figured that he had to cut away $250 million in costs each quarter to get the company back in the black. That required not only cutting employees, but cutting unprofitable projects and consolidating the company’s structure. The product based structure was abandoned, and a simplified structure that separated the company based on task was implemented, eliminating duplicate projects.
Amelio also took this opportunity to cut away some of the executives who had proven themselves ineffective or incompetent. Even Cahill was not spared. Perhaps the most important cut was Marco Landi, the head of Apple Americas, the sales division of the company. He had authorized the price slashing and was also incredibly abrasive, yelling at subordinates and bypassing the hierarchy.
Overall,  3,000 people lost their jobs, making it almost 6,000 Apple employees who were laid off or quit in little more than a year.
Mistakes
While Amelio eroded his support inside and outside the company through reorganizations and clumsy mistakes, Jobs was positioning NeXT engineers throughout the company. Ellen Hancock had long been a target for Jobs, and she was eventually replaced by Avie Tevanian, one of the creators of the Mach microkernel that was the basis of Mk Linux and NeXTstep.
Jon Rubenstein, another NeXT veteran, was picked to run the hardware division.
Two bizarre incidents took place during April, and they all pointed to Jobs. The first was an attempted hostile takeover of Apple by Larry Ellison on behalf of Steve Jobs. Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, had started promoting the idea of “network computing”, essentially glorified dumb terminals. He hoped that Apple would start manufacturing NCs (as they were called) and prod along the revolution.
It turned out that he could not get enough like-minded investors to jump on board and stopped his efforts.
Three days after the Amelios and Jobses enjoyed a vegetarian dinner at Gaylords, Amelio received a rude awakening in the form of a notice from the SEC that a stockholder had sold 1.5 million shares of Apple stock.
The Second Coming of Steve Jobs
Amelio immediately suspected that Jobs had unloaded the stock he got from the NeXT deal, but Jobs flatly denied it. Amelio pressed him and got a sheepish admission and a pseudo-apology.
The man Amelio brought in to save Apple had stabbed him in the back by indicating he had no confidence in Apple’s future under Amelio.
After Jobs’ vote of no confidence, Bill Gates stonewalled Amelio. Amelio was looking for a way to convince Gates to develop Office (a product generating $300 million a year for Microsoft from the Mac alone) for Rhapsody, Apple’s NeXTstep-based operating system. Gates flat out refused, even after Amelio offered to bundle Internet Explorer with all Macs.
To Amelio’s dismay, Gates agreed to a much less favorable offer from Jobs a little less than four months later.
On day 499 of Amelio’s tenure at Apple, he received some bad news. Board member Ed Woolard called Amelio during his July 4th family reunion to break the news. Amelio had been terminated, and Fred Anderson would run the company until a suitable replacement could be found.
Amelio was stunned into silence. His next and last day at Apple, day 500, was spent packing his belongings and saying good-bye to his executives.

Description
                    This wide ranging oral history charts Gil’s life and career from humble beginnings in New York and Florida to CEO of several high tech giants in California. He attended Georgia Tech where as an undergrad, he started, built and sold an information services company. After that sale he went on to finish his BS, MS and PhD in Physics.

After graduation, Gil went to work at Bell Labs, where is did pioneering work in CCDs (Charge Coupled Devices). After making major contributions at Bell Labs, he moved on to Fairchild Semiconductor in California in 1971 where he continued his work on CCDs and developed a number of critical products. In his 12 years at Fairchild, he moved more towards the management and business side of the operation. 

From Fairchild, Gill moved on to the semiconductor division of Rockwell in southern California, where he was chartered with turning around a money-losing operation. After a successful turnaround, the division was eventually sold at a profit and Gil moved on to take the CEO position at National Semiconductor in Silicon Valley. After five years of rebuilding that company, he was recruited to the Board of Apple Computer in 1994 and eventually took over the CEO position in 1996. In 1997, after he had brought Steve Jobs back to the company, Jobs succeeded him as CEO in July of that year.

Since leaving Apple, Gil has continued to follow his varied interests in business and technology, including venture investing, mentoring of new startups, and inventing new technologies.

Early life and career[edit]
He grew up in Miami, Florida, of Italian born parents, and graduated from Miami High School.[1] He received a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, Amelio was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.
Amelio joined Bell Labs as a researcher in 1968.[2] In 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).[3] He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s,[4] and in 1977 became head of the MOS division. He worked his way up to president of the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and then its communications systems division.[5]
Amelio joined National Semiconductor as president and chief executive in February 1991.[5]
Apple Computer[edit]
In 1994 Amelio joined the board of directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor, Amelio became Apple CEO on February 2, 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. [6] He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section "Certain Transactions" in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.[7]
Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $429 million.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs.[8] Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. In a 2007 interview with technology journalist Gina Smith, Jobs quoted Amelio as having a saying:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.[9][10][11]

It was reported that Amelio's contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.[12]
Post-Apple career[edit]
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell.[13] He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.[14]
In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.[15][16][17] Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.[18][19][20]
Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. Amelio was director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni.[citation needed] In October 2005 Amelio joined the board of advisors to Vanguard PAC (now TheVanguard.Org).[21] Amelio is also a member of the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless R&D company. Gil Amelio is on the advisory board of tech start-up Intelicloud.[22]
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow.[23] He has been awarded 16 patents.[citation needed] He is the author of three books: An American Imperative (1993),[citation needed] Profit from Experience (1995, ISBN 978-0471287049) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998, ISBN 978-0887309199).

Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $429 million.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs.[8] Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. In a 2007 interview with technology journalist Gina Smith, Jobs quoted Amelio as having a saying:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.[9][10][11]

It was reported that Amelio's contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.[12]
Post-Apple career[edit]
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell.[13] He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.[14]
In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.[15][16][17] Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.[18][19][20]
Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. Amelio was director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni.[citation needed] In October 2005 Amelio joined the board of advisors to Vanguard PAC (now TheVanguard.Org).[21] Amelio is also a member of the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless R&D company. Gil Amelio is on the advisory board of tech start-up Intelicloud.[22]
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow.[23] He has been awarded 16 patents.[citation needed] He is the author of three books: An American Imperative (1993),[citation needed] Profit from Experience (1995, ISBN 978-0471287049) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998, ISBN 978-0887309199).

Early life and career[edit]
He grew up in Miami, Florida, of Italian born parents, and graduated from Miami High School.[1] He received a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, Amelio was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.
Amelio joined Bell Labs as a researcher in 1968.[2] In 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).[3] He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s,[4] and in 1977 became head of the MOS division. He worked his way up to president of the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and then its communications systems division.[5]
Amelio joined National Semiconductor as president and chief executive in February 1991.[5]
Apple Computer[edit]
In 1994 Amelio joined the board of directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor, Amelio became Apple CEO on February 2, 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. [6] He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section "Certain Transactions" in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.[7]
Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $429 million.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs.[8] Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. In a 2007 interview with technology journalist Gina Smith, Jobs quoted Amelio as having a saying:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.[9][10][11]

It was reported that Amelio's contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.[12]
Post-Apple career[edit]
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell.[13] He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.[14]
In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.[15][16][17] Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.[18][19][20]
Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. Amelio was director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni.[citation needed] In October 2005 Amelio joined the board of advisors to Vanguard PAC (now TheVanguard.Org).[21] Amelio is also a member of the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless R&D company. Gil Amelio is on the advisory board of tech start-up Intelicloud.[22]
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow.[23] He has been awarded 16 patents.[citation needed] He is the author of three books: An American Imperative (1993),[citation needed] Profit from Experience (1995, ISBN 978-0471287049) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998, ISBN 978-0887309199).

Early life and career[edit]
He grew up in Miami, Florida, of Italian born parents, and graduated from Miami High School.[1] He received a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, Amelio was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.
Amelio joined Bell Labs as a researcher in 1968.[2] In 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).[3] He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s,[4] and in 1977 became head of the MOS division. He worked his way up to president of the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and then its communications systems division.[5]
Amelio joined National Semiconductor as president and chief executive in February 1991.[5]
Apple Computer[edit]
In 1994 Amelio joined the board of directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor, Amelio became Apple CEO on February 2, 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. [6] He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section "Certain Transactions" in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.[7]
Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple's work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.
To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs' NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $429 million.
During Amelio's tenure Apple's stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs.[8] Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. In a 2007 interview with technology journalist Gina Smith, Jobs quoted Amelio as having a saying:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.[9][10][11]

It was reported that Amelio's contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.[12]
Post-Apple career[edit]
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell.[13] He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.[14]
In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.[15][16][17] Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.[18][19][20]
Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia's Prime Minister. Amelio was director of AT&T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, the Georgia Tech Advisory Board (as chairman) and the American Film Institute. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni.[citation needed] In October 2005 Amelio joined the board of advisors to Vanguard PAC (now TheVanguard.Org).[21] Amelio is also a member of the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless R&D company. Gil Amelio is on the advisory board of tech start-up Intelicloud.[22]
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow.[23] He has been awarded 16 patents.[citation needed] He is the author of three books: An American Imperative (1993),[citation needed] Profit from Experience (1995, ISBN 978-0471287049) and On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple (1998, ISBN 978-0887309199).

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
