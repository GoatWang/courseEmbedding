                    Dunham & Associates Investment Counsel, Inc. - a Registered Investment Adviser/Broker 
                    Dealer and Advisor to the Dunham Mutual Funds

                    Founded in 1985, Dunham & Associates Investment Counsel, Inc. features a family of public mutual funds 
                    with performance-based Sub-Adviser compensation, also commonly known as fulcrum fees. Allocation portfolios 
                    are available individually or as part of a turnkey asset management program.
                    
                    Dunham & Associates is driven by performance and we believe client fees should be tied to returns measured 
                    against applicable benchmarks. That’s why we tie the compensation of our Sub-Advisers and ourselves to the 
                    success of your investments wherever possible.*
                    

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses of the Dunham 
                    Funds carefully before investing. This and other important information is contained in the Fund's summary 
                    prospectus and/or prospectus, which may be obtained by contacting your financial advisor, or by calling toll 
                    free (800) 442-4358. Please read prospectus materials carefully before investing or sending money. Investing 
                    involves risk, including possible loss of principal.

* Some Sub-Advisers may receive minimum compensation regardless of whether or not an established 
                    performance benchmark is met or exceeded. Member FINRA/SIPC.

                With respect to the risk order assigned to the above list of Funds, the annual standard deviation,
                based upon representative indices of historical asset class index returns over the past 15 and 20
                years, rounded to whole numbers, as well as qualitative factors, were considered. Performance
                tends to be more stable for products with a lower standard deviation. In the case where certain
                Funds are statistically similar, the subjective judgment of management based on qualitative
                criteria may be used. Historical standard deviation (risk) is not an indication of future
                expected risk. The risk order above is subject to change.
            

                Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares,
                when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost. The N share class is only offered by
                registered investment advisers as part of an advisory program which includes advisory fees in
                addition to those presented in the prospectus. Funds distributed by

                Funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
                governmental agency. With respect to the risk scale assigned to the above list of securities,
                the standard deviation of historical asset class index returns used to measure risk (or volatility)
                indicates the variability of returns from the average return for that asset class. Performance
                tends to be more stable for products with a lower standard deviation. Historical standard
                deviation (risk) is not an indication of future expected risk.

Composite Score:





                        Zappos.com has received 4.67 out of 5 stars based on 8 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Calculation methodologyThis tool provides a list of Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds that are similar to the non-Vanguard product you specified. All data and scoring is provided by Morningstar®, including the methodology which scores each product on a scale of 10 (most similar) to 0 (least similar). The methodology is based on several factors, including the category, special criteria, portfolio allocation, and performance of each product.The general process for generating a list of similar funds is as follows:First we conduct a preliminary screen of all Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds based on the category and other attributes of the product specified. For products with less than three years of performance history, a Performance score of "0" will be displayed, and the Overall similarity score will match the Portfolio score.Then we score each product based on how similar its portfolio is to that of the product you specified.We also score each product based on how similar its performance has been relative to the product you specified.Finally, we calculate an overall similarity score.The Performance score utilizes the last 36 months of returns, as of each month end. The Portfolio score utilizes the most recent daily portfolio stored for the fund and will reflect that portfolio at any given time.
