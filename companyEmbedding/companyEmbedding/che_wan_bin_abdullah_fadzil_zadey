The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial
statements of INBIT CORP., a Nevada corporation and development stage company,
and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii)
the more detailed business information and the December 31, 2016 audited
financial statements and related notes included in the Company's most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (File No.
333-209497), as filed with the SEC on March 27, 2017. Statements in this section
and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current
fact constitute "forward-looking" statements.



OVERVIEW



INBIT CORP. (the "Company" or "we") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on
September 30, 2014 and has a fiscal year end of December 31. It is a development
stage Company.




Going Concern




To date the Company has no operations or revenues and consequently has incurred
recurring losses from operations. No revenues are anticipated until we complete
the Plan of Operation described in this Form 10-Q and implement our initial
business plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain
profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Our activities have been financed primarily from the proceeds of share
subscriptions. From our inception to June 30, 2017, we raised a total of $31,000
from private offerings of our common stock.
The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings.
There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through
this or any other offerings.




CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES




The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP").
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We have identified the policies below as critical to
our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results:



Basis of Presentation



The Company reports revenues and expenses using the accrual method of accounting
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("US GAAP") for financial and tax reporting purposes.



Cash and Cash Equivalent



The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



Foreign Currency Translation



The financial statements are presented in United States dollars. In accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification "ASC 830", "Foreign Currency
Translation", foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated
to their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which
prevailed at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Revenue and
expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the periods
presented. Related translation adjustments are reported as a separate component
of stockholders' equity (deficit), whereas gains or losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations.



9







Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential
dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company.
Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the
accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.



PLAN OF OPERATION



We are a development stage company engaged in the business of investment
holding.




Results of Operations




Three -Month and Six -Month Periods Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016
We recorded no revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and we have
generated operating revenues of $2,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
We have generated operating revenues of $4,500 since inception.
For the three months ended June 30, 2017, total expenses and professional fees
was $35,081. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, total expenses and
professional fees was $37,548.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, total expenses and professional fees
was $3,065. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, total expenses and
professional fees was $8,600.
From the period of September 30, 2014 (inception) to June 30, 2017, we incurred
operating expenses of $88,985.



10







Liquidity and Capital Resources
At June 30, 2017, we had no cash balance. We do not have sufficient cash on hand
to fund our ongoing operational expenses beyond 12 months. We will need to raise
funds to fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely
come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock. If we are
successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will
experience dilution of their interest in our Company.

	(Pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14f-1 thereunder)


	 


	THIS INFORMATION STATEMENT IS BEING PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. NO VOTE OR OTHER ACTION OF THE COMPANY’S STOCKHOLDERS IS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INFORMATION STATEMENT. NO PROXIES ARE BEING SOLICITED AND YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND A PROXY TO THE COMPANY.


	 



	INTRODUCTION



	 


	This Information Statement is being mailed on or about November 1, 2016 to holders of record at the close of business on October 31, 2016 (the “

	Record Date

	”), of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “

	Common Stock

	”), of Inbit Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “

	Company

	”), in connection with the change of control of and composition of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “

	Board

	”). The change of control is the result of the sale of a majority of the issued and outstanding Common Stock by the holder thereof which sale was consummated on October 26, 2016 (the “

	Closing Date

	”).


	 


	This Information Statement is being furnished pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “

	Exchange Act

	”) and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. This Information Statement is being provided solely for informational purposes and not in connection with a vote of the Company’s security-holders.


	 


	No action is required by the Company’s stockholders in connection with this Information Statement. Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder require the mailing to the Company’s stockholders of record of the information set forth in this Information Statement at least ten (10) days prior to the date a change in a majority of the Company’s directors occurs (otherwise than at a meeting of the Company’s stockholders). This Information Statement will be first mailed to the Company’s stockholders of record on or about November 1, 2016.


	 



	CHANGE OF CONTROL



	 


	You are not required to vote on either the change of control or the addition of directors and your vote is not requested. Normally, the election of directors requires a vote of the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote. In this case, on the Closing Date Mr. Viktor Zeziulia, appointed Tan Chee Hong, Choy Cheng Choong, Loke Yeu Loong, Teo Joo Meng and Zadey Che Wan Bin Abdullah Fadzil to the Board of Directors. Mr. Zeziulia has also agreed to resign as a director ten (10) days after this Information Statement is mailed to shareholders, which will leave the aforementioned five (5) Directors of the Company. Under the Company’s bylaws, no vote of stockholders of the Company is required to effectuate the appointment of a new director to fill a vacant seat, or for the change in the composition of the board in the manner described herein.


	 



	 




	2













	 




	 


	On the Closing Date, Mr. Zeziulia, the holder of an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately 79.37% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company as of the Closing Date, sold 5,000,000 of his shares of Common Stock to Nine (9) purchasers shown in the table below, each of whom now beneficially owns greater than 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the “

	Purchasers

	”). As a result of the foregoing transactions on the Closing Date, The Purchasers own Common Stock representing approximately 79.37% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock


	 



	CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS



	 


	Mr. Zeziulia, the President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, submitted his resignation from all executive officer positions with the Company, and his membership on the Board, which resignation shall become effective at the close of business on the 10

	th

	day following the mailing of this Information Statement to the stockholders of the Company (the “

	Effective Date

	”). Tan Chee Hong was appointed to the Board of Directors, and appointed as President, Chief Executive Officer, interim Secretary, Treasurer, and Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board, effective upon the Closing Date.


	 



	DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS




	AND CONTROL PERSONS



	 


	On the Closing Date, Mr. Zeziulia resigned all officer positions with the Company and resigned as Chairman of the Board (but remained a Board member). Mr. Zeziulia also resigned as a director of the Company, provided that his resignation is subject to and not effective until the close of business on the 10th day after the Company distributes an information statement to its shareholders in accordance with SEC Rule 14f-1. The Company did not have any committees, and therefore Mr. Zeziulia never served on any committees. Mr. Zeziulia did not resign as a result of any disagreement with the Company. Mr. Tan Chee Hong was appointed Chairman of the Board, and the Board appointed the following officers and directors:


	 


	To the best of the Company’s knowledge, except as set forth below, the incoming directors have not been involved in any transactions with the Company or any of its directors, executive officers, affiliates or associates which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “
