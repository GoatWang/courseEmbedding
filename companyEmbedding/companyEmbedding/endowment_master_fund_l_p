Merrill Lynch Hedge Fund Investors Offered Opportunity To Exit The Endowment Fund With Substantial Losses
Posted: March 7th, 2014
According to recent SEC filings, the Endowment Master Fund LP, has offered investors an exit strategy from the hedge fund offering a new fund through a Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) which will be used to liquidate the Fund.  The Endowment Master Fund, LP was marketed heavily by Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch.  The PPM describes the Offer as a like-kind exchange of investors’ pro-rata interest of the portfolio holdings into a new PMF Fund, LP.   According to the SEC filings, dated February 20, 2014, “the PMF Fund, LP and the Endowment Master Fund, LP will be managed differently, with the PMF Fund, LP managed for purposes of orderly liquidation.”
For investors, the Offer provides little certainty because investors must choose whether to liquidate now without knowing the true value of the Fund which will be determined at a later date.  `The Offer for the like-kind exchange expires March 19, 2014 which requires more than a leap of faith for investors in a hedge fund that has languished far behind the market returns.  Investors must make an investment decision without knowledge of the value exchanged and how much will be realized during the liquidation period.  According to the New York Times article, After Weak Returns, the Endowment Fund Limits Withdrawals, the hedge fund, “began to struggle in 2011, suffering losses of about 4.1 percent, after fees, compared with a gain of 2.5 percent by the S&P 500.”
 On February 24, 2014, a Thomson Reuters article underscores the effects of the substantial hedge fund costs on the Funds dismal performance, “Even for investors who stay with the fund, there will be high costs.  They will not be permitted to ask for any money back this year.  They will also be charged a 1 percent management fee and a 1 percent servicing fee.  On top of that there will be the fund’s underlying managers’ 1.3 percent management fee and a 16 percent of profits as an incentive fee.”  The article points to the hedge fund underperformance in 2013, “with the fund earning only 2.08 percent last year, dramatically trailing the Standard & Poor’s 32 percent gain.”  For Merrill Lynch customer’s, “If investors accessed the Endowment Fund through Merrill Lynch they will have paid as much as a 2.5 percent upfront charge.”
With these costs in mind, retail investors are discovering that these fees and costs can evaporate any real or potential profits they can earn.  Retail investor liquidity concerns make investments in the Endowment Fund suitable only when they have long enough investment time horizon over multiple market cycles.  Because of the uncertainties outlined in the PMF Fund PPM, investors who were advised to invest in the hedge fund now appreciate the risks associated with illiquidity when the funds experience such under performance.  Full-service brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch are responsible for conducting adequate due diligence concerning the investment vehicles they recommend and whether these investments are suitable for their customers.  However, with multiple layers of fees, costs and incentive bonuses, these alternative investments are quickly becoming Wall Street’s favorite investment products to sell.

 PART C  The information required to be included in Part C is set forth under the appropriate item, so numbered, in Part C of the Registration Statement. 


PART A  Responses to Items 1, 2, 3.2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Part A have been omitted pursuant to Paragraph 3 of Instruction G of the General Instructions to Form N-2.  Responses to certain Items required to be included in Part A of this Registration Statement are incorporated herein by reference to Amendment No.�5
to the Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File No.�811-21528) and Amendment No.�3 to the Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File No.�811-21730) (each, a �Feeder Fund�s Registration Statement on Form N-2�) of,
respectively, The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P. and The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. (the �Feeder Funds�), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�).  �


ITEM�3.
FEE TABLE.  The following table illustrates the
approximate expenses and fees that you will pay if you buy and hold Interests in The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (�Master Fund�). The information below and specifically the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (as described below in footnote 2)
are a required disclosure for investment companies that are registered under the 1940 Act. Since the Master Fund is registered under such act, it is required to provide these disclosures. Other funds that invest in underlying funds (�fund of
funds�) as does the Master Fund will also incur expenses from the underlying funds in which they invest, however these funds are not required to disclose this information to investors if they are not registered under the 1940 Act. 
Annual Expenses (as a percentage of average net assets of the Master Fund):  �







 Management Fee
��

 Other Expenses (1)
��

 Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (2)
��
8.59

��
�
�

 Total Annual Expenses (3)
��
9.96
%
 �


 (1)
 Other Expenses are estimated based on the Master Fund�s expenses during the year ended December�31, 2007.
Certain administrative and other expenses applicable to feeder funds that invest in the Master Fund, including those of the Feeder Funds, are applied at the feeder fund level rather than at the Master Fund level.  �


 (2)
 The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include the operating expenses and performance-based incentive fees of the
underlying investment funds (�Investment Funds�) in which the Master Fund invests. The costs incurred at the Investment Fund level include management fees, administration fees, professional fees, incentive fees and other operating
expenses. In addition the Investment Funds also incur trading expenses, which may include interest and dividend expenses, which are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the investment managers of the Investment Funds
(�Investment Managers�) in order to seek to enhance or preserve the Investment Funds� returns. The Master Funds investments are allocated among many asset classes, including absolute return, private equity and private real estate
among others. Investment Funds with absolute return objectives may on average employ more leverage than certain other types of Investment Funds thus resulting in higher interest expense amounts being included for some Investment Funds employing this
strategy. Investment Funds that are private equity funds will on average incur higher expense levels early on in the fund�s investment cycle as the investments in this asset class often have a longer term investment horizon, which can result in
higher expense ratios early in such fund�s investment cycle due to the �J curve effect.� Investment Funds investing in real estate and other depreciable assets may incur depreciation expense, which could increase the expense ratio for
some of these Investment Funds. In addition, for recently launched funds in which the Master Fund may invest, the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses may tend to be significantly greater in the initial years as startup costs are being borne over a
smaller invested capital base. The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were calculated in good faith by the Adviser. There are several components that go into the calculation and for some Investment Funds, complete, updated information was not
available. Generally the calculation is based on responses received from the underlying Investment Funds, the most recent shareholder reports, the most recent investor communication (which in some cases may be the Investment Funds offering
documents) or other materials/communications with the underlying Investment Funds. The fees and expenses disclosed above are based on historic earnings of the Investment Funds, which may (and which should be expected to) change substantially over
time and, therefore, significantly affect Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. In addition, the Investment Funds held by the Master Fund will change, which further impacts the calculation of the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. Generally, fees payable
to Investment Managers of the Investment Funds will range from 1% to 2.5% (annualized) of the average NAV of the Master Fund�s investment in such Investment Funds. In addition, certain Investment Managers charge an incentive allocation or fee
generally ranging from 15% to 25% of an Investment Fund�s net profits, although it is possible that such ranges may be exceeded for certain Investment Managers. The expenses charged by the underlying Investment Funds are not paid to the Fund or
the Adviser and represent the costs incurred to invest in the Investment Funds.  �
- 4 - 




 (3)
 The �Total Annual Expenses� of the Master Fund disclosed above differ from the ratio of expenses to average
net assets (Master Fund expense ratio) included in the Financial Highlights section of the financial statements in the Master Fund�s 2007 annual report. The financial statements in the shareholders report depict the Master Fund�s direct
expenses, but do not include in expenses the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses that represent costs incurred at the underlying Investment Fund level, as required to be disclosed in the above table. As reported in the Financial Highlights section of
the Master Fund�s 2007 annual report, the Master Fund�s annual expenses to average partners� capital for the year ended December�31, 2007 was 1.37%.  �
- 5 - 


The purpose of the table below is to assist an investor in understanding the various costs and expenses
that an investor in the Master Fund will bear directly or indirectly. For a more complete description of the various fees and expenses of the Master Fund, see the sections entitled �Summary of Fund Expenses� and �Fund Expenses�
in the Feeder Funds� private placement memorandum (�Memorandum�) included in the Feeder Funds� Registration Statement on Form N-2. The example is based on the fees and expenses as set forth in the table above, including the
Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as set out in the table above and should not be considered a representation of future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. The rate of return of the Master Fund may be greater or less
than the hypothetical 5% return used in the example. A greater rate of return than that used in the example would increase the dollar amount of the investment advisory fee paid by the Master Fund.  Example  �

 Had the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses resulting from the underlying Investment Funds not been
included in the example above, such that only the direct expenses incurred at the Master Fund level were included, the estimated fees and expenses for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods would have been as follows:  Example  �

ITEM�10.
CAPITAL STOCK, LONG-TERM DEBT, AND OTHER SECURITIES  �


ITEM�10.1.�
CAPITAL STOCK  The Master Fund is organized as a
limited partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware and intends to be classified as a partnership for income tax purposes. An investor in the Master Fund (a �Partner�) will be a limited partner in the Master Fund and his or her
rights in the Master Fund will be established and governed by the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Master Fund, dated as of November 27, 2007 (as amended from time to time, the �Partnership Agreement�). A
Partner and its advisers should carefully review the Partnership Agreement, as each Partner will agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. The following is a summary description of certain provisions of the Partnership Agreement. The
description of such provisions is not definitive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Partnership Agreement. Reference should be made to the complete text of the Partnership Agreement.  The security purchased by a Partner is a limited partnership interest (an �Interest�) in the Master Fund. All Interests shall be fully paid and
nonassessable. Partners shall have no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for any additional Interests.  The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, serves as the general partner of the Master Fund (�General Partner�). The General Partner has initially appointed a board of directors (�Board�) and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, has irrevocably delegated to the Board its rights and powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Master Fund, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management, conduct and
operation of 
 �
- 7 - 



the Master Fund�s business. In no event shall any Partner, in his or her capacity as such, have any role in the management of the Master Fund�s
affairs. The Partners shall have power to vote only: (i)�for the election of directors; (ii)�with respect to any amendment of the Partnership Agreement, to the extent and as provided therein; and (iii)�with respect to such additional
matters relating to the Master Fund as may be required by the Partnership Agreement, applicable law or any registration of the Master Fund with the SEC or any state, or as the Board may consider necessary or desirable. With respect to any matter,
the Partners shall vote in proportion to their capital account balances as of the record date applicable to the consideration of such matter. There shall be no cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Partners may vote in person or by
proxy. Unless the Board in its sole discretion determines otherwise, only matters set forth in the notice of a meeting may be voted on by Partners at a meeting. From time to time, the Board may seek to obtain voting instructions from Partners, in
which case the Board will establish such procedures and protocols as it deems to be appropriate under the circumstances.  The Partnership
Agreement provides that on any matter submitted to a vote of all Partners, all Partners entitled to vote shall vote together. There normally will be no meetings of Partners for the purpose of electing members of the Board except that, in accordance
with the 1940 Act: (i)�the Master Fund will hold a Partners� meeting for the election of members of the Board at such time as less than a majority of the members of the Board holding office have been elected by Partners of the Master Fund;
and (ii)�if, as a result of filling a vacancy on the Board, less than two-thirds of the members of the Board holding office will have been elected by the Partners, that vacancy may be filled only by a vote of the Partners.  The Board (or its designated agent) may admit Partners to the Master Fund from time to time upon the execution by a prospective investor of an
appropriate signature page to the Partnership Agreement or upon the completion and execution, and the acceptance of the same by the Board (or its designated agent), of a subscription agreement in a form established by the Fund from time to time. The
Board (or its designated agent) has the right to refuse to accept investments in the Master Fund for any or no reason. Interests will be issued only in a transaction or transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act.  The Master Fund may be dissolved (i)�by written determination of the Board to dissolve the Master Fund; (ii)�upon the entry of a decree of
judicial dissolution under Section�17-802 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, 6 De1.C. Section�18-101, et seq. (as amended from time to time, the �Delaware Act�); or (iii)�upon the withdrawal of the
General Partner, unless (a)�at such time there remains at least one general partner who elects to continue the business of the Master Fund, (b)�the Board, by majority vote, elects to continue the business of the Master Fund and appoints,
effective as of the date of the withdrawal of The Endowment Fund GP, L.P. as General Partner, one or more additional general partners, or (c)�within 90 days after the withdrawal, Partners whose capital account balances represent in the
aggregate at least a majority of the total balance of all capital accounts entitled to vote, elect to continue the business of the Master Fund and appoint, effective as of the date of the General Partner�s withdrawal, one or more additional
general partners.  Any Partner may, in connection with the dissolution and liquidation of such Partner, tender to the Master Fund for
redemption all of such Partner�s Interest. In the event of such a tender for redemption, the Master Fund, subject always to the terms of the Partnership Agreement and the Master Fund�s ability to liquidate sufficient Master Fund
investments in an orderly fashion determined by the Board to be fair and reasonable to the Master Fund and all of the Partners, shall pay to such redeeming Partner within 90 days the proceeds of such redemption, provided that such proceeds may be
paid in cash, by means of in-kind distribution of Master Fund investments, or as a combination of cash and in-kind distribution of Master Fund investments.  The Board may, without the vote of the Partners, (i)�cause the Master Fund to convert to a corporation, statutory trust or association, a real estate investment trust, a common-law trust, a general partnership
(including a limited liability partnership) or a limited liability company, organized, formed or created under the laws of the State of Delaware, as permitted pursuant to Section�17-219 of the Delaware Act and (ii)�in connection with any
such conversion, cause any outstanding Interests to be exchanged or converted into securities of or interests in the business form into which the Master Fund is converted under or pursuant to any state or federal statute to the extent permitted by
law.  �
- 8 - 


No Partner (or other person holding an Interest or a portion of an Interest acquired from a Partner) will
have the right to require the Master Fund to redeem its Interest or any portion thereof. No public market exists for the Interests, and none is expected to develop. Consequently, Partners may not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a
result of repurchases of Interests by the Master Fund, as described below.  The Board, from time to time and in its sole discretion, may
determine to cause the Master Fund to offer to repurchase Interests from Partners, including the Adviser and/or the General Partner, pursuant to written tenders by Partners. The Adviser anticipates that it will recommend to the Board to cause the
Master Fund to conduct repurchase offers on a quarterly basis in order to permit the Fund to conduct repurchase offers for Interests. However, there are no assurances that the Board will, in fact, decide to undertake any repurchase offer. The Master
Fund will make repurchase offers, if any, to all Partners, on the same terms, which may affect the size of the Master Fund�s repurchase offers. A Partner may determine, however, not to participate in a particular repurchase offer or may
determine to participate to a limited degree, which will affect the liquidity of the investment of any investor in the Partner.  �

INDEMNIFICATION  Section�3.10 of the Third
Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement states as follows:  �


�
(a)
 To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership will, subject to Section�3.10(c) of this Agreement, indemnify each General Partner and Adviser
(including for this purpose each officer, director, member, Partner, principal, employee or agent of, or any Person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, a General Partner or Adviser or Partner of a General Partner or
Adviser, and their executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives) and each Director (and his executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives) (each such Person being referred to as an
�indemnitee�) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising by reason of being or having been a General Partner, Adviser or Director of the Partnership, or the past or present performance of services to the

 �
- 13 - 




�
 
Partnership by the indemnitee, except to the extent that the loss, claim, damage, liability, cost or expense has been finally determined in a judicial
decision on the merits from which no further right to appeal may be taken in any such action, suit, investigation or other proceeding to have been incurred or suffered by the indemnitee by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence,
or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee�s office. These losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses include, but are not limited to, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise, or
as fines or penalties, and counsel fees and expenses incurred in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit, investigation or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal, before any judicial, arbitral, administrative or
legislative body, in which the indemnitee may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise, or with which such indemnitee may be or may have been threatened, while in office or thereafter. The rights of indemnification provided under this
Section�3.10 are not to be construed so as to provide for indemnification of an indemnitee for any liability (including liability under U.S. Federal securities laws which, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on Persons that act
in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but will be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this Section�3.10.  �


�
(b)
Expenses, including counsel fees and expenses, incurred by any indemnitee (but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise, or as fines or penalties) may be
paid from time to time by the Partnership in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit, investigation or other proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay to the Partnership amounts paid if a
determination is made that indemnification of the expenses is not authorized under Section�3.10(a) of this Agreement, so long as (1)�the indemnitee provides security for the undertaking, (2)�the Partnership is insured by or on behalf
of the indemnitee against losses arising by reason of the indemnitee�s failure to fulfill his, her or its undertaking, or (3)�a majority of the Independent Directors (excluding any Director who is either seeking advancement of expenses
under this Agreement or is or has been a party to any other action, suit, investigation or other proceeding involving claims similar to those involved in the action, suit, investigation or proceeding giving rise to a claim for advancement of
expenses under this Agreement) or independent legal counsel in a written opinion determines, based on a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that reason exists to believe that the indemnitee ultimately will be
entitled to indemnification.  �


�
(c)
As to the disposition of any action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (whether by a compromise payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise) without an adjudication or
a decision on the merits by a court, or by any other body before which the proceeding has been brought, that an indemnitee is liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee�s office, indemnification will be provided in accordance with Section�3.10(a) of this Agreement if (1)�approved as in the best interests of the Partnership by a
majority of the Independent Directors (excluding any Director who is either seeking indemnification under this Agreement or is or has been a party to any other action, suit, investigation or proceeding involving claims similar to those involved in
the action, suit, investigation or proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement) upon a determination, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that the indemnitee acted
in good faith and in the reasonable belief that the actions were in the best interests of the Partnership and that the indemnitee is not liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee�s office, or (2)�the Directors secure a written opinion of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full
trial-type inquiry), to the effect that indemnification would not protect the indemnitee against any liability to the Partnership or its Partners to which the indemnitee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee�s office.  �


�
(d)
 Any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section�3.10 will not prevent the recovery from any indemnitee of any amount if the
indemnitee subsequently is determined in a final judicial decision on the merits in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding involving the liability or expense that gave rise to the indemnification or advancement of expenses to be liable to the
Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
 �
- 14 - 




�
 
negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee�s office. In any suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification under this Section�3.10, it will be a defense that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct described in this Section�3.10. In any suit in the name of the Partnership to recover any
indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section�3.10, the Partnership will be entitled to recover the expenses upon a final adjudication from which no further right of appeal may be taken. In any suit brought to
enforce a right to indemnification or to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section�3.10, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to any indemnification or
advancement of expenses, under this Section�3.10 will be on the Partnership (or any Partner acting derivatively or otherwise on behalf of the Partnership or its Partners).  �


�
(e)
An indemnitee may not satisfy any right of indemnification or advancement of expenses granted in this Section�3.10 or to which he, she or it may otherwise be entitled except
out of the assets of the Partnership, and no Partner will be personally liable with respect to any such claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses.  �


�
(f)
The rights of indemnification provided in this Section�3.10 will not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any Person may be entitled by contract or otherwise
under law. Nothing contained in this Section�3.10 will affect the power of the Partnership to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any General Partner, any Director, the Adviser or other Person.  �


�
(g)
The General Partner may enter into agreements indemnifying Persons providing services to the Partnership to the same, lesser or greater extent as set out in this Section�3.10.
 Section�14 of the form of Investment Management Agreement between the Master Fund, The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P. and Endowment
Advisers, L.P. states as follows:  (a) Each Fund will indemnify the Adviser and any Adviser Affiliate, and each of their partners, members,
directors, officers, and employees and any of their affiliated persons, executors, heirs, assigns, successors, or other legal representatives (each an �Indemnified Person�) against any and all costs, losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities, joint or several, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys� fees and disbursements, resulting in any way from the performance or non-performance of any Indemnified Person�s duties in respect of the Fund, except
those resulting from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of an Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Person�s reckless disregard of such duties and, in the case of criminal proceedings, unless such Indemnified Person had
reasonable cause to believe its actions unlawful (collectively, �disabling conduct�). Indemnification shall be made following: (i)�a final decision on the merits by a court or other body before whom the proceeding was brought that the
Indemnified Person was not liable by reason of disabling conduct; or (ii)�a reasonable determination that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder, provided that such determination is based upon a review of the facts and
reached by (A)�the vote of a majority of the Fund�s Directors who are not parties to the proceeding or (B)�legal counsel selected by a vote of a majority of the Fund�s Board, further provided that such counsel�s
determination be written and provided to the Board. A Fund shall advance to an Indemnified Person reasonable attorneys� fees and other costs and expenses incurred with respect to the Fund in connection with defense of any action or proceeding
arising out of such performance or non-performance. The Adviser agrees, and each other Indemnified Person will be required to agree as a condition to any such advance from a Fund, that if one of the foregoing parties receives any such advance, the
party will reimburse the Fund for such fees, costs, and expenses to the extent that it shall be determined that the party was not entitled to indemnification under this paragraph. The rights of indemnification provided hereunder shall not be
exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any person may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law.  (b) Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, the provisions of this section 14 shall not be construed so as to relieve the Indemnified Person of, or provide indemnification with respect to, any liability (including liability under federal securities laws, which, under certain
circumstances, impose liability even on persons who act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that such liability may not be waived, limited, or modified under applicable law or that such indemnification would be in violation of
applicable law, but shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of this paragraph to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.  �

THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.  (A Limited Partnership)  � Notes to Schedule of Investments  September 30, 2004  � 1. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
 � In the normal course of business, The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the
�Fund�) will invest in a variety of investment vehicles including, but not limited to, limited partnerships and limited liability companies (collectively, the �Investment Funds�), registered investment companies and direct
investments in marketable securities and other derivative instruments. The Investment Funds in which the Fund invests trade various derivative securities and other financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with off-balance
sheet risk. These activities may include, but are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts, interest rate swaps, futures contracts and options on futures, credit default swaps, use of leverage and total return equity swap
contracts. The Fund�s risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the value of the investment in such Investment Funds as reported by the Fund.  � 2. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS  � The valuation of the Fund�s investments will be determined as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly. The valuation of the
Fund�s investments is ordinarily calculated by Citco Fund Services, Ltd. (or an affiliate thereof, collectively �Citco�), the Fund�s independent administrator (the �Independent Administrator�) in consultation with
Endowment Advisers, L.P., the adviser to the Fund (the �Adviser�). The Fund�s investments are ordinarily based upon valuations provided to it by the investment managers of such Investment Funds or, in many cases, the administrators of
those Investment Funds. The valuation of the Investment Funds is reviewed by a committee approved by the Fund�s board of directors (the �Board�) and established to oversee the valuation of the Fund�s investments (the
�Valuation Committee�), in consultation with the Adviser and the Independent Administrator. The net assets of the Fund will equal the value of the total assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued fees and expenses.
 � Investments are valued as follows:
 � - INVESTMENT FUNDS - Investments in Investment Funds are ordinarily valued at
the valuations provided to the Independent Administrator by the investment managers of such Investment Funds or the administrators of those Investment Funds. The Fund�s investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of
the respective operating agreements and offering memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund�s investments in Investment Funds are carried at estimated fair value as determined by the Fund�s pro-rata interest in the net assets of each Investment
Fund. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, this estimated fair value may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investments in Investment Funds existed. These Investment Funds value their underlying
investments in accordance with policies established by such Investment Funds. All valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and estimated performance incentive fees or allocations payable to
the Investment Funds� managers pursuant to the Investment Funds� agreements. 


- SECURITIES LISTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE - In general, the Fund values listed securities at their last sales price as
of the last business day of the applicable period. If no sales occurred on that date, the securities are valued at the mean between the �bid� and �asked� prices at the close of trading on that date.  � - SECURITIES LISTED ON OVER-THE-COUNTER EXCHANGES - Securities listed on over-the-counter
exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the date of determination, if available, through the facilities of a recognized interdealer quotation system (such as securities in the NASDAQ National Market List) or at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price. If the last reported sales price is not available, the securities are valued at the mean between the �bid� and �asked� prices at the close of trading on that date.  � - OPTIONS - Options that are listed on a securities exchange or traded over-the-counter are
valued at the mean between the closing �bid� and �asked� prices for such options on the date of determination.  � SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED - The value of securities, derivatives, or synthetic securities that are not actively traded on an exchange shall be determined by an
unaffiliated pricing service that may use actual trade data or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield curves, specific trading characteristics of certain groups of securities, pricing models, or a combination of these procedures.
 � - OTHER - Where no value is readily available from an Investment Fund or other
security or where a value supplied by an Investment Fund is deemed not to be indicative of the Investment Fund�s value, the Valuation Committee and/or the Board, in consultation with the Independent Administrator or the Adviser will determine,
in good faith, the estimated fair value of the Investment Fund or security.  � 3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS  � The
Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis. Securities owned or sold, not yet purchased, are marked to estimated fair value at the date of the financial statements, and the corresponding unrealized gain or loss is included in the
statement of operations.  � Realized gains or losses on the disposition of
investments are accounted for based on the first in first out (�FIFO�) method. Distributions received from investments, whether in the form of cash or securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment. 


Item 2. Controls and Procedures.  �


(a)
Disclose the conclusions of the registrant�s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, regarding the effectiveness of the
registrant�s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph, based on the
evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(b)) and Rule 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).  � The registrant�s principal executive officers and principal
financial officer have concluded, based on their evaluation of the registrant�s disclosure controls and procedures as conducted within 90 days of the filing date of this report, that these disclosure controls and procedures are adequately
designed and are operating effectively to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant on Form N-Q is (i) accumulated and communicated to the investment company�s management, including its certifying officers, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission�s rules and forms.  �


(b)
Disclose any change in the registrant�s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the
registrant�s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant�s internal control over financial reporting.  � There were no changes in the registrant�s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the registrant�s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant�s internal control over financial reporting. 
� Item 3. Exhibits.  � File as exhibits as part of this Form a separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
registrant as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2(a)). Certifications pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) are attached hereto.  �


SIGNATURES  �
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, the registrant has duly caused this report
to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.  �
