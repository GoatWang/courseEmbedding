Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

Profile


Samuel K. Skinner Chairs the Chicago Government Law & Policy Practice and has had a career in both the governmental and private sectors. As Of Counsel to the firm, he consults with clients in a variety of areas, including strategizing on complex litigation matters, state and federal regulatory matters, governmental matters, transportation issues, and corporate governance.
Mr. Skinner is the retired Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of USF Corporation, one of the nation's leading transportation and logistics companies. During each year that he served as CEO, the company was recognized by Fortune magazine as one of America's most admired companies. From 1993-1998 he served as President of Commonwealth Edison Company and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon), one of the country's largest utilities.


Prior to joining Commonwealth Edison, Mr. Skinner served as Chief of Staff to President George H. W. Bush. As Chief of Staff, he coordinated the activities of numerous cabinet departments and administrative agencies reporting to the President. Prior to his White House Service, he served in the President's Cabinet for nearly three years as Secretary of Transportation. In that capacity, he served as Chief Executive Officer of a Department with a budget of more than $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. As Secretary, Mr. Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the development and passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also developed our country's "Open Skies" policy which liberalized U.S. international aviation policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Mr. Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Eastern Airlines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Washingtonian magazine twice gave Mr. Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation and he has also received numerous awards from the transportation industry.
Mr. Skinner has spent more than 50 years in the legal profession. In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford appointed him the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, one of the few career prosecutors ever to hold that position. In this position, he managed one of the Department of Justice's largest and most respected field offices. While in the U.S. Attorney's office, Mr. Skinner investigated and successfully litigated various complex financial fraud, official corruption, and civil rights cases, including the trial of United States Circuit Judge Otto Kerner. He also was in private practice at two large Chicago law firms where he held positions of leadership.
While practicing law, Mr. Skinner also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district.

Mr. Skinner has also taught as Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Samuel K. Skinner

Samuel K. Skinner has had a distinguished career in both the governmental and private sectors.  As Of Counsel to the firm, he consults with clients in a variety of areas including strategizing on complex litigation matters, state and federal regulatory matters, governmental matters, transportation issues and corporate governance.  
Mr. Skinner is the retired Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of USF Corporation, one of the nation’s leading transportation and logistics companies.  During each year that he served as CEO, the company was recognized by Fortune magazine as one of America’s most admired companies.  He also served from 1993-1998 as President of Commonwealth Edison Company and its holding company Unicom Corporation, one of the country’s largest utilities.
Prior to joining Commonwealth Edison, Mr. Skinner served as Chief of Staff to President George H. W. Bush.  As Chief of Staff, he coordinated the activities of numerous cabinet departments and administrative agencies reporting to the President.  Prior to his White House Service, he served in the President’s Cabinet for nearly three years as Secretary of Transportation. In that capacity, he served as Chief Executive Officer of a Department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people.  As Secretary, Mr. Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President’s National Transportation Policy and the development and passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation.  He also developed our country’s “Open Skies” policy which liberalized U.S. international aviation policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S.  In addition, Mr. Skinner acted as the President’s point person in numerous crisis situations, including the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Eastern Airlines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike.  Washingtonian magazine twice gave Mr. Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation and he has also received numerous awards from the transportation industry.
Mr. Skinner has spent more than 20 years in the legal profession.  In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford appointed him the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, one of the few career prosecutors ever to hold that position.  In this position, he managed one of the Department of Justice’s largest and most respected field offices.  While in the U.S. Attorney’s office, Mr. Skinner investigated and successfully litigated various complex financial fraud, official corruption, and civil rights cases, including the trial of United States Circuit Judge Otto Kerner.  He also was in private practice at two large Chicago law firms where he held positions of leadership.
While practicing law, Mr. Skinner also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation’s second largest mass transportation district.  In this capacity, he developed the RTA’s first strategic plan that was used as a blueprint for a multi-billion dollar service expansion and capital development program.
Upon graduation from college, Mr. Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation where he was selected as one of their three Outstanding Salesmen of the Year Nationwide in 1967.
Mr. Skinner served as an adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, where he taught a course on leadership.
On April 1, 2005, Mr. Skinner was appointed by President George W. Bush to be a member of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission.  The Commission is charged with making determinations regarding which of the nation’s more than 400 military facilities will remain active and which will be closed.

Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

Samuel K. Skinner


          	Executive. Educator. Public Servant.



May 1, 2004
















Samuel K. Skinner has turned out to be one of the Army’s best. He has been appointed by three U.S. presidents for high public service positions, led blue chip corporations, and is revered as a leading collegiate educator.
From July 2000 through 2003, Skinner served as President and Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Freightways, a global leader in the transportation and logistics industry with a workforce of over 22,000 employees and with annual revenues in excess of $2.5 billion. In every year that Mr. Skinner served as CEO of USF Corporation, the company was recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the most admired corporations in America and received numerous awards for excellence from national publications and customers. As Mr. Skinner retired in May of 2003, he was specifically hailed for preparing the company’s information technology and human resource capabilities for future growth.
Prior to joining U.S. Freightways, Mr. Skinner was President of the Commonwealth Edison Company and its holding company Unicom Corporation, one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. During his five years at Unicom, he helped position the company for the emerging competitive market and had operating responsibilities involving the regulated and unregulated activities of the business. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Skinner led the company’s successful effort to obtain landmark legislation to restructure the electric utility industry in Illinois.
After retiring from Commonwealth Edison Company and Unicom, Mr. Skinner served as Co-Chairman of Hopkins & Sutter, a national law firm based in Chicago prior to assuming his current position.
Mr. Skinner served as Chief of Staff to the first President George Bush. As Chief of Staff, he coordinated the activities of numerous cabinet departments and administrative agencies reporting to the President. Prior to his White House Service, Mr. Skinner served in the President’s Cabinet for nearly three years as Secretary of Transportation. In that capacity, he served as Chief Executive Officer of a Department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people.
As Secretary, Mr. Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President’s National Transportation Policy and the development and passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also developed our country’s "Open Skies" policy which liberalized U.S. international aviation policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S.
In addition, Mr. Skinner acted as the President’s point person in numerous crisis situations, including the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Eastern Airlines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Washingtonian magazine twice gave Mr. Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation and he has also received numerous awards from the transportation industry.
Other presidential appointments include:

• In 1983, Mr. Skinner was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Presidents Commission on Organized Crime where he served as Vice Chairman.
• In 1975, President Ford appointed Mr. Skinner United States Attorney, one of the few career prosecutors ever to hold that position. In this position, he managed one of the Department of Justice’s largest and most respected field offices. While in the US Attorney’s office, Mr. Skinner investigated and successfully litigated various complex financial fraud, official corruption, and civil rights cases.

Mr. Skinner graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in Accounting. He served as a Lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961 and is an honor graduate of the Army Officers Basic Course. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review.
Mr. Skinner has taught courses at both the John Marshall Law School and the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. In addition, he has served as a guest lecturer at the Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management and has also lectured at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business where he held the Poling Chair of Government and Business.
Mr. Skinner has served on numerous Corporate Public Boards. He is also involved with numerous charitable and not-for-profit organizations at the local and national level. He is a Director of the United States Chamber of Commerce where he serves as Chairman of the Institute for Legal Reform, the nation’s leading organization advocating reform of our nation’s tort system including changes in class action, medical malpractice and massive tort liability systems.

Description

                    Shortly after midnight on March 24, 1989, the 987-foot tank vessel Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. What followed was the largest oil spill in U.S. history. The oil slick has spread over 3,000 square miles and onto over 350 miles of beaches in Prince William Sound, one of the most pristine and magnificent natural areas in the country. Experts still are assessing the environmental and economic implications of the incident. The job of cleaning up the spill is under way, and although the initial response proceeded slowly, major steps have been taken. The very large spill size, the remote location, and the character of the oil all tested spill preparedness and response capabilities. Government and industry plans, individually and collectively, proved to be wholly insufficient to control an oil spill of the magnitude of the Exxon Valdez incident. Initial industry efforts to get equipment on scene were unreasonably slow, and once deployed the equipment could not cope with the spill. Moreover, the various contingency plans did not refer to each other or establish a workable response command hierarchy. This resulted in confusion and delayed the cleanup. Prepared by the National Response Team, this report was requested by the President and undertaken by Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly. The report addresses the preparedness for, the response to, and early lessons learned from the Exxon Valdez incident. The President has also asked Secretary Skinner to coordinate the efforts of all federal agencies involved in the cleanup and Administrator Reilly to coordinate the long-term recovery of the affected areas of the Alaskan environment. These efforts are ongoing. The report addresses a number of important environmental, energy, economic, and health implications of the incident.show more

As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.

Early life[edit]
Skinner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 10, 1938, the son of Imelda Jane Curran and her husband, Vernon Orlo Skinner. He grew up in Springfield, Illinois and Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Community High School in 1956.[1] He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha, Beta Eta chapter at the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he served as a lieutenant and a tank platoon leader in the United States Army in 1960-1961. He graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1966, where he served on the law review. Skinner has been involved in the Boy Scouts most of his life, earning the Eagle Scout award as a youth in Troop 35, in Wheaton, and being honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award as an adult.
After his military service, Skinner held various sales and management positions with the IBM Corporation from 1960 to 1968. In 1967, IBM selected him Outstanding Salesman of the Year. Although offered position to serve as Assistant to the Chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., Skinner decided to enter a career in public service.
Law career[edit]
From 1968 to 1975, Skinner served in the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois as an Assistant United States Attorney and, in 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed the 37-year-old Skinner the United States Attorney. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Skinner combated organized crime and public corruption. In 1974, Skinner and co-counsel, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and future Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, successfully prosecuted then-U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.. This was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting federal court of appeals judge was found guilty of a federal crime. During his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office, Skinner also worked directly with future U.S. Court of Appeals Judges William J. Bauer, Joel M. Flaum, and Ilana Rovner, U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras, future U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois Dan K. Webb and Anton R. Valukas, future United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun, and future Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner.
From 1977 to 1989, Skinner practiced law as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where he served on the firm's executive committee and as its second lateral partner in its 100-year-old history. From 1984 to 1988, while practicing law full-time, he also served as Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of northeastern Illinois, the nation's second largest mass transportation district. Also during that time, President Reagan appointed Skinner as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
George H. W. Bush Administration[edit]
After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office for a career in the private sector, Skinner became active in Republican politics in Illinois. Skinner led the Illinois efforts of George H. W. Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign and successful 1988 presidential campaign, the last time a Republican candidate for president carried Illinois in the general election.
In December 1988, Skinner was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary of Transportation. Skinner was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 1989 and assumed the office on February 6, 1989.
As Secretary of Transportation, he served as chief executive officer of a cabinet-level federal department with a budget of over $30 billion and a workforce of 105,000 people. During his tenure, Skinner was credited with numerous successes, including the development of the President's National Transportation Policy and the passage of landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. He also issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. In addition, Skinner was instrumental in developing President Bush's National Transportation Policy and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which served as the catalyst for the whole ITS industry.
He also developed the "open skies" policy of the United States that liberalized U.S. international policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the U.S. In addition, Skinner acted as the President's point person in numerous crisis situations, including the Eastern Air Lines strike, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the northern California earthquake, Hurricane Hugo, and the 1991 national rail strike. Skinner's role in these emergencies earned him the moniker "The Master of Disaster". Washingtonian magazine twice gave Skinner its highest ranking for his performance as Secretary of Transportation.
After Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in August 1991, Skinner was offered the position. However, he turned down the role due to the inability of the Attorney General to engage in election-related political activity per the Hatch Act of 1939. In December 1991, Skinner left his job as Secretary of Transportation to replace John H. Sununu as White House Chief of Staff.
As White House Chief of Staff, Skinner acted as the President's chief surrogate and led the implementation of the President's domestic policy agenda leading into the 1992 general election. Under Sununu, domestic policy initiatives had drifted into the background in favor of foreign policy centered around the Persian Gulf War. Skinner served in the position from December 1991 until August 1992, when he was tasked to work on the campaign full-time at the Republican National Committee and was replaced as Chief of Staff by then-Secretary of State James Baker.
Post-Bush Administration career[edit]
Upon leaving the White House, Skinner returned to Chicago and became President of Commonwealth Edison and its holding company Unicom Corporation (now Exelon) from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Skinner left this role to become Co-Chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Hopkins and Sutter. In July 2000, he was named Chairman, President, and CEO of US Freightways, retiring from that role three years later in April 2003.
Skinner is currently on the board of directors of Navigant Consulting, Echo Global Logistics, Virgin America, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), and an advisor to Metalmark Capital. He also serves as director emeritus of Express Scripts. In 2015, Skinner was appointed Chairman of the Takata Corporation Independent Quality Assurance panel to conduct an internal investigation of the Company's airbag manufacturing process.
Since 2006, Skinner has served as of counsel at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. From 2003-2008, Skinner was an Adjunct Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He serves on the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.
Family[edit]
Skinner and his first wife, Susan Ann Thomas, had three children. His eldest son, Thomas Vernon Skinner, is the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national compliance program, director of the EPA's region 5, and current General Counsel of Louisiana State University. Another son, Steven Knox Skinner, is the CEO of KemperSports, a privately owned company that manages over 100 golf courses across the country. His daughter, Jane Skinner Goodell, is a former news anchor on Fox News Channel's Happening Now and the wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.[2]
Skinner currently resides in Winnetka, Illinois with his wife, Honey Jacobs Skinner, a retired partner at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. Together, they have two sons, Samuel Jacobs Skinner and William Curran Skinner. His niece through marriage is actress Gillian Jacobs.[3]
Awards[edit]
Skinner is the recipient of numerous awards, including honorary degrees from George Washington University and Lake Forest College. In 2017, he was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in the areas of Government and Law.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
