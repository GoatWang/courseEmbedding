Feasibility Study Offers Optionality to Maximize Cash Flow
				(6/15/17)

      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(6/6/17)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. announced results of the definitive feasibility study for the Asanko gold project, incorporating a revised life-of-mine (LOM) plan which considers sequencing of the recently discovered satellite deposits as well as sequencing of the Esaase pit. Overall, the results of the feasibility compare favorably with our modeled LOM plan for the Asanko mine based on production growth, operating costs, capex requirements and tons mined (both from the Obotan and Esaase projects)."
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(6/6/17)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. announced results of the expansion definitive feasibility study (DFS) for the Asanko gold project. . .[it] shows an executable path towards derisking the company's production that will be sourced from multiple pits, providing a high degree of flexibility."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(2/24/17)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. is still considering a multi-stage expanded operating scenario which would increase production to 450 Koz/year by 2020. . .we see the company's growth prospects remaining intact, albeit at a slightly higher operating cost, but supported by discovery potential offered by Asanko's prospective land package."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(2/6/17)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. has now received all necessary permits for the construction and operation of the Esaase pit at its Asanko mine, including the overland conveyor to transport ore from Esaase to the existing processing plant. A revised definitive feasibility study that will include revised mineral reserves, resources as well as a revised life-of-mine plan is anticipated before month end (February 2017)."

		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(1/12/17)

		
		"We believe with Phase 1 performance exceeding expectations, Asanko Gold Inc. is well positioned to deliver a compelling production growth of ~100% to ~300 koz by 2018 and ultimately become a ~0.5MM oz producer through Phase 2B by 2020. . .we await the final feasibility study with detailed mine plans to update our valuation model(Q1/17). . .given the production growth profile, we  believe AKG would be a coveted asset in any of the major's asset portfolio. . .we maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50 per share." 
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(1/11/17)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. reported Q4/16 production results which were in-line with expectations. . .AKG reported Q4/16 production of 57 koz, which compares favorably with our estimate of 56 koz. . .recoveries of 94% exceeded our expectations of 92%. Management expects these recoveries to continue into the foreseeable future."
		
		







More Expert Comments







  
      Geordie Mark, Haywood Securities
  

(12/5/16)

		
		"We see Asanko Gold Inc. as a growing gold producer through the staged expansion of the Asanko Gold Mine through Phase 2 (A and B). . .the 
Company's 2017 operations  plan concentrates on ramping-up exploitation rates at Nkran, with a total of 25 million tonnes (Mt) of material expected to be exploited from the pit, which will include 4 Mt of ore and 5 Mt of waste removed as part of the west wall  pushback. . .we  project total production of 241 Koz of gold at a cash cost of $672/oz." 
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(11/24/16)

		
		"We return highly encouraged from our Asanko Gold Inc. site visit;  we were impressed by the  team  on  the  ground  that  has  successfully  delivered  Phase  1  ahead  of  schedule  and  within  budget. Year  2  (2017)  production  of Phase  1  is  now  being guided for 230�240koz, 25%-30% ahead of DPP plan of ~184koz. . . the better  than  expected  ramp-up  for  Phase  1  has  positioned  the  company  well  to  deliver  compelling  production  growth  through  Phase  2  that would  boost  production  to  470  koz/year  by  2020; given  the  production growth  profile,  we  believe  AKG  would  be  a  coveted  asset  in  any  of  the  major's  asset  portfolios."   
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(11/24/16)

		
		For Asanko Gold Inc., the Asanko mine's near-term  production  potential  (Phase  1  completed, 2017  production  and  cost  guidance recently released) and Phase 2A expansion plan rank as the paramount near-term value driver for AKG's shareholders. . .we  continue  to  see  Asanko  as  a  low  cost  mine  (2017E AISC  of ~$825/oz, RJL's definition) capable of producing ~215koz (2017E), ~230koz (2018E), ~275koz (2019E/2020E), and ~460 koz (2021E). We  note  that  our  2017  production  estimate is  conservative  and  falls  below company guidance of  230 to 240 koz for 2017." 
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(11/21/16)

		
		"We think Asanko Gold Inc. has done a good job reaching commercial production and LOM reserve grades within the first year of initiating Phase 1. We also see YOY growth as another positive sign that AKG is meeting development expectations at Phase 1. . .we calculate our price target of C$6.00 by applying a ~10x multiple to our average three-year forward estimated cash flow per share of C$0.62 at a 1.35 US$/C$ exchange rate. . .on a P/NAV basis, the C$6.00 price target represents a ~1x multiple to our 5% discounted NAV."
		
		









SmallCapPower
(11/10/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. is a top takeover target after impressive Q3 results. . .the company's most recent financial/operating results suggest that it is firing on all cylinders and may attract the attention of other suitors. . .the company has a more than 7.9 million ounce Measured & Indicated gold resource at its flagship Asanko Gold Mine. On November 7, 2016, Asanko announced Q3 gold production of 53,986 ounces, a 49% increase from the previous quarter, allowing it to generate net income of US$11.7 million and boost its working capital to $66.7 million."
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(11/8/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc.'s Q3 CFPS of $0.18 was ahead of our estimated $0.14 and consensus of $0.11 driven by lower operating cash costs that came in at $544/oz, 15% below our estimated $637/oz. . .the Phase 1 ramp-up has been progressing better than expected with the processing facility operating 20% above design, gold recoveries 1.5% above plan, mining grades converging with reserve grades and operating costs in line with the DPP. . .this sets the stage for the company to deliver a strong production growth through Phase 2A. . .we maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50."
		
		












  
      Geordie Mark, Haywood Securities
  

(11/7/16)

		
		"Our target price of $6.50 for Asanko Gold Inc. is based on an 8x EV/OCF multiple to our 2017 cash flow estimate of C$0.92/sh. . .Q3/16 financial results were largely in-line with expectations as operating data had been released previously. . .the company reported Q3/16 revenues of US$72 million driving EBITDA of US$37 million and operating cash flow of US$36 million or US$0.18 per share. . .2017 Forecasts: We project total production of 241 koz gold at an average AISC of $595/oz; our 2017 forecasts drive revenues of US$343 million."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(11/7/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. reported production of 54 koz Au (pre-reported ahead
of RJL�s previous estimate of 45 koz Au), at a cash operating cost of 
$609/oz (vs. RJL at $814/oz) and an AISC of $907/oz (vs. RJL at $911). 
AKG�s operating results for the quarter were ahead of previous expectations(grades,recoveries). . .our C$6.75 target is derived by applying a 50/50 weighting on 1.1x NAV and 11x 2017E CFPS estimate. . .our target price implies a 1.15x P/NAV multiple which we feel is justified given AKG�s organic growth profile."
		
		









  
      Jamie Spratt, Clarus Securities
  

(11/4/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. announced it has received an environmental invoice for mining Esaase and for constructing the conveyor to the processing facility at Nkran.  The AKG Board has approved the commencement of Phase 2A expansion that would boost production to 300 koz/year by 2018. . .AKG trades at a significant discount to peers and in our opinion, the market has not yet priced in the value for Phase 2 implying all the upside from Phase 2 comes for free at current valuations. . .we maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50/share."
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(11/4/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. announced that the Board has approved the Phase 2A expansion which will upsize mill throughput from 3.6Mtpa to 5Mtpa from 2018. What's new here is a faster ramp-up with production expected to be ~300koz in 2018 vs. consensus, which is currently ~230koz. . .we have adjusted our throughput for today's news and note that our 2018 production estimate increases to 296koz. . .our CFPS estimates for 2018 have increased by ~40%."
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(10/20/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. is carrying out optimization studies, including detailed metallurgical test work, for assessing the opportunity to accelerate Phase 2B. . .most importantly, mining grades have consistently improved toward reserve grade with 2.0 g/t mined during September. . .we estimate that the company will exit the year with ~US$91m in liquidity which, combined with continued operating cash flow generation of ~US$125/year, should be sufficient to fund Phase 2A expansion and accelerate the development of Phase 2B that would eventually boost production to +450 koz/year. . .we maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50."  
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(10/13/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. reported a slight beat on Q3 production numbers of 54 
koz vs. CIBC's estimate of 52 koz; the beat was primarily related to 
higher throughput and better recoveries with the mill consistently 
operating ~20% above design capacity in Q3. . .the average gold grade mined tracked higher through the quarter, approaching reserve grade of 2.15 g/t. That said, mined grades in September of 2 g/t were ~7% below reserve grade. . .with stockpiles increased, we expect mining/milling rates in Q4 will be more inline, and that the stockpile will remain at steady-state levels."
		
		












  
      Geordie Mark, Haywood Securities
  

(10/13/16)

		
		"For Q3/16, Asanko produced 53,986 oz gold, which was higher than our expectations of 49 Koz; reported revenues came in at US$71.3 million from the sales of 54,393 ounces at an estimate average price 
of US$1,311/ounce, and exceeded our revenue expectation of US$66 million. . .we see these results as highly positive as Q3/16 gold production came in well above our expectations on higher than expected throughput rates, gold recoveries and milled head grades. The ramping throughput rates  with elevated processing plant gold recoveries bodes well for operational performance."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(10/13/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. reported 3Q16 production results which were ahead of expectations. . .AKG expects to beat the upper end of its production guidance for 2H16 and produce between 106 koz and 111 koz for 2H16. . .although operating costs weren�t disclosed, we take comfort in noting that the 3Q16 strip (4.5:1) is lower than our estimated strip (5.7:1) for the quarter. . .our C$6.75 target is derived by applying a 50/50 weighting on 1.1x NAV and 11x 2017E CFPS estimate. . .our target price implies a 1.15x P/NAV multiple which we feel is justified given AKG�s organic growth profile." 
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(10/13/16)

		
		"We continue to believe that Asanko Gold Inc. is well positioned to deliver a compelling production growth of ~100% by 2019 through phase 2 and ultimately be a ~0.5 Moz producer by 2022, all which can be internally funded supported by the company�s high margin phase 1 operations. . .we maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50 per share. . .we believe near term catalysts including�Phase 2 DFS, Akwasiso resource update  and Nkran Extension permits should support re-rating of the stock. . .we maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50 per share."
		
		












  
      Geordie Mark, Haywood Securities
  

(9/20/16)

		
		"We believe Asanko Gold Inc. holds a critical mass of gold resources and reserves  at Esaase and Obota that can be developed to provide Asanko Gold with growth capacity and processing optimality to start initial production on a low cost basis to weather potential commodity price volatility. . .Assuming  total  CAPEX  of US$275 million and our current cost estimates, Asanko Gold should be able to fund the development through cash flow and existing debt facilities.. . .Our target price of $6.50 is based on an 8.0x EV/OCF multiple to our 2017 cash flow estimate of $0.74/sh. Our estimated corporate NAV 8% is $5.75 per share."
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(9/20/16)

		
		"We believe that the near-mine exploration success coupled with  throughput expansion should enable Asanko Gold Inc. to deliver a significant production boost in 2017 and 2018 before ore from the Esaase is accessed. . .We highlight that the Akwasiso target offers upside to our modelled ounces and though early, a potentially high grade profile. . .Despite a compelling production growth profile of ~100%  by 2019, ahead of average for peers, AKG trades at 0.7x P/NAV or a ~45% discount to emerging producer peers trading at an average of 1.2x. We maintain our BUY rating and target price of $8.50 per share."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(9/19/16)

		
		"The initial results from Asanko Gold Inc.'s Akwasiso are encouraging and reflect the Nkran shear corridor�s exploration potential. .  .Highlighted intersections include 54 m at 3.85 g/t Au, 16 m at 3.65 g/t Au, and 12 m at 4.66 g/t Au. . .Our C$6.75 target is derived by applying a 50/50 weighting on a 10x 2017E CPFS and a 1.3x NAV. Our target price implies a 1.25x P/NAV multiple which we feel is justified given AKG�s organic growth profile (Phase II expansion)."

The trio was the driving force behind Keegan Resources that eventually changed its name to Asanko Gold Inc.  and recently began gold production in Ghana after a merger with PMI Gold Corporation in 2012. Between the dregs of 2008 and the market high of 2011 for gold, Keegan gave an 1850% return to shareholders.

The Gold Report Interview with Geordie Mark 

(2/11/16)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. was a developer in Ghana that has evolved into a producer with its first gold pour in late January. The company joins the ranks of other recent producers like Torex Gold Resources Inc. and Guyana Goldfields. We believe that Asanko has delivered on capital cost estimates and reached production a month earlier than originally expected. The mill is already apparently running through stockpiled ore at designed capacity, and we believe that the company should enjoy more attention as the Asanko gold mine ramps up production. . .I'm comfortable with Ghana's geopolitical risk. Numerous of gold mines operate there, so there's a lot of history. I think Ghana is the third largest gold-producing country in Africa. . .we are looking at Asanko's 2016 production of about 197 Koz at cash costs of $610/oz and all-in sustaining costs just over $900/oz. After the company's ramp-up year, we are looking to the company to deliver free cash flow in 2017. We believe that there is a nearer-term objective to try and elevate mill throughput via the introduction of more oxide material. Such could be undertaken principally through the discovery of additional oxide ounces nearby, and we believe that Asanko is striving to deliver on such aims over the near term."

		"Asanko Gold Inc.'s processing facility is projected to be ready during December with commissioning to use stockpiled ore material. . .the company is in the process of installing 20 MW of temporary diesel generator capacity, which should be operational as a back-up by December, in time for hot commissioning. . .Asanko remains fully funded through to production for phase 1 of the Asanko Gold mine."
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Canaccord Genuity
  

(11/9/15)

		
		"We continue to forecast for Asanko Gold Inc. a cushion of $40�45M (versus company guidance of $40M) and a minimum working capital position of ~$18�20M in Q2/16 during the ramp-up to commercial production. . .as our target price continues to imply a 26% return from current levels, we maintain our Speculative Buy rating."

		"Asanko Gold Inc. is advancing, permitted and fully funded, with a high-grade, open-pit project in a manageable jurisdiction expected in commercial production in 2016. . .the net impact of our Q4/15 commodity (long-term gold price, down 2.4% to US$1,243/oz) combined with advancing our valuation forward to the end of 2016, had a positive impact on our valuation of Asanko Gold."

      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(9/30/15)

		
		"As a near-term gold producer (its first gold pour is expected in Q1/16), Asanko Gold Inc. fits nicely within our current investment theme of amassing positions in companies with established assets. . . Asanko continues to have upside leverage to rising gold prices. It's an enviable position to be in and one that continues to make the company at buy at current levels." 
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Canaccord Genuity
  

(9/22/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Corp.'s phase 1 Obotan (P1 Obotan) gold project of the Asanko gold mine (Ghana) is 75% complete (2,400 personnel on site) with all the procurement in hand. The company has completed its internal detailed ramp-up plan for P1 Obotan and we continue to forecast commissioning of the Nkran plant (3 Mtpa) in Q1/16E leading to commercial production (Q2/16E) followed by steady state levels (Q3/16E)." 
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(9/22/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Corp. announced that project construction is 75% complete and is tracking on budget with 98% of the total preproduction capital committed. With the project a few weeks ahead of the original schedule, management is now shifting focus to the commissioning plan. . .we maintain our Buy rating and recommend investors add to their positions ahead of the producer rerating which we expect to happen over the coming months."
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(9/18/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. has provided an update on the Asanko gold mine phase 1 construction in Ghana. Overall, the project looks to be on track for completion on schedule and on budget toward the end of Q4/15. We think the steady rate of construction and successful relocation of local residents reflect well on Asanko's ability to manage the mine development and, given the company should have sufficient funds to reach production, we expect the update should be supportive for the stock."
		
		












  
      Geordie Mark, Haywood Securities
  

(9/17/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc.'s mine and processing facility development is slightly ahead of schedule for a Q1/16 first gold pour. Costs are reportedly on-budget, and the majority of outstanding capital expenditures have been committed. We believe that the partial Village relocation completion marks a big step in de-risking project progress and are further encouraged by the advancement of project development with all critical capital items in place and development activities shifting to piping, electrical and mechanical completion."
		
		












  
      Nana Sangmuah, Clarus Securities
  

(9/17/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. announced that project construction is 75% complete and is tracking on budget with 98% of the total preproduction capital committed. With the project a few weeks ahead of the original schedule, management is now shifting focus to the commissioning plan. . .we maintain our Buy rating and recommend that investors add to their positions ahead of the producer re-rating that we expect to happen over the coming months. . .despite having above-average production and lower costs, Asanko's stock trades at a discount to peers."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(9/16/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. released a positive construction update for its Asanko Gold mine project in Ghana. Construction is ~75% complete and the project remains fully funded and on schedule for first gold pour in early Q1/16. . .as management continues to derisk the project and nears first production, we expect the market to continue to rerate the stock higher toward producer multiples (1x NAV)."
		
		












  
      Joe Mazumdar, Canaccord Genuity
  

(8/26/15)

		
		"Delaying Asanko Gold Inc.'s Esaase option (+2 years) allows for 100% organic funding. . .funding P2 Esaase internally removed the need for external sources, which included a previously modeled US$170M debt facility (H2/16E) and a CA$100M equity raise (2017E) to fund the US$290�300M capital required to develop the project. The net impact of the removal of the external sources of funding and the reduction in valuation related to the delay in production (+2 years) led to an increase in our target price (CA$0.10 or 4%) to CA$2.55. As our revised target price implies a 34% return, we have upgraded our recommendation on Asanko to Speculative Buy from Hold." 
		
		









  Canaccord Genuity's Morning Coffee
(8/19/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. is in the process of updating a 12-month plan for the commissioning and ramp-up of the phase 1 Obotan gold project (expected Q3/15) and expectations are for first pour by Q1/16 leading to commercial production by Q2/16. We also expect a feasibility study for phase 2 Esaase in Q3/16 to advance it to a construction decision."
		
		












  
      Brent Cook, Exploration Insights
(8/9/15)

		
		"We own Asanko Gold Inc.'s stock in the letter and have for some time. The company controls two deposits in Ghana with a total Measured and Indicated 7.9 Moz and reserves of 5.2 Moz. The mine is being developed in two phases, with phase 1 exploiting the Obotan deposit. . .phase 2 will exploit the Esaase deposit. . .the combined project shows an after-tax net present value (5%) of $770M and internal rate of return of 27% at $1,300/oz gold, with all-in sustaining costs of $798/oz."
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Joe Mazumdar 

(8/6/15)

		
		"Asanko Gold Inc. is advancing the first phase (P1 Obotan) of the Asanko gold mine in Ghana through commissioning (Q1/16E) to commercial production (Q2/16E). We recently upgraded Asanko from Hold to Speculative Buy as our target price (CA$2.60) implies a +30% return to current levels. Year to date in 2015, Asanko has outperformed the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF benchmark (up 11.6% vs down 19.1%). . .I rate the Asanko phase 1 ramp up as excellent as P1 Obotan construction is 60% complete with 2,400 personnel on site and on schedule for first pour by Q1/16 leading to cash flow positive commercial production (Q2/16), in line with our forecasts. All critical path items are in hand and on schedule, according to the company. Mining is advancing faster than planned (100 Kt/day, +10%) as the contractor has mined over 7.9 Mt of the required 21.7 Mt of pre-stripping for Nkran. Importantly, dewatering has pumped out 56% (3.36 Mm3) of the 6.0 Mm3 required at the Nkran pit, which hosts the largest mineable resource base (>85%) at P1 Obotan. The water level has fallen 24m since dewatering began in December 2014. Another critical item is the partial relocation of the Nkran village (88 buildings), which is on track for the end of Q3/15. 
As power availability and reliability is a critical issue in Ghana, Asanko's management has signed a deal with an independent power producer, Genser Energy Ghana Ltd., to secure power to the site. We estimate that ~45% of Asanko's processing costs are related to power. The company is also progressing on its 30km 161 kV power line (Q3/15E completion) to connect to the power grid. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA), Genser Energy as operators will have the right to utilize the power line to sell excess power onto the grid or to supply through the grid. The PPA also provides Asanko some security and flexibility with respect to power needs during ramp-up of the 3 Mt/year processing facility at Nkran."

The  Gold Report Interview with Andrew Kaip 

(7/30/15)

		
		"One of the opportunities is in what we call predevelopment names. Asanko Gold Inc., which is building the 2.3 Moz Asanko mine in Ghana, is one. It has the balance sheet and the financing necessary to go into production, so long as it executes according to plan. And it's trading at fairly significant discounts relative to intermediate or junior gold producers."

(NYSEMKT:AKG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Asanko Gold: Study Confirms PotentialJun. 6.17 | About: Asanko Gold (AKG) Peter Arendas Long only, commodities, research analystSummaryAsanko was attacked by the shorters last week, this time the attack was successful.Asanko's management denied the accusations of Muddy Waters LLC, regarding the operational issues and additional cash needs.After the Esaase deposit is in full production, Asanko Gold should produce approximately 450,000 toz gold per year, at an AISC of $890/toz, according to the DFS.There is a chance that the expansion of the current operations will be financed from internal sources.The current market value of the company is $317 million, which doesn't reflect the true potential Asanko Gold.For Asanko Gold (NYSEMKT:AKG), the last 6 days were really hectic. On May 31, Muddy Waters LLC released a negative report on Asanko Gold. Among other claims, Muddy Waters stated that Asanko Gold has a huge problem with the collapse of the western wall of its Nkran pit and as a result, it will have to invest $75-115 million to keep Nkran in production. Muddy Waters also stated that Asanko doesn't have enough money to keep Nkran in production and it is about to go bankrupt. Although Asanko has provided information about the collapse several weeks ago and it has also stated that the collapse had no major impacts on its operations, some of Asanko's investors got scared by Muddy Waters' report and Asanko's share price collapsed to $1.3, before the trading was halted. 

 AKG data by YCharts Muddy Waters is another short seller that tried to push Asanko's share price down. The previous attempts were made by K2, that attacked Asanko's resource estimates (some of the articles were published also here on Seeking Alpha: 1, 2, 3, 4). Asanko responded in the best way possible and it released an updated resource estimate prepared using a more conservative methodology that resulted into only a slightly lower resource and reserve estimate. Although the attempts of K2 didn't cause too much damage, Muddy Waters was able to push Asanko's share price down by more than 30% in less than one hour. Although Asanko made a press release where it denied all of the speculations, the share price has recovered only partially.
 As shown by the chart above, Asanko's share price is down by almost 50% year-to-date. At the same time, the short interest is up by more than 500%. The short interest grew from less than 3 million shares in early January, to the current level of 16.7 million shares. In early 2016, the short interest was way below the 1 million shares level. It started to grow rapidly in June, which coincides with the first of the abovementioned K2 articles. The current short interest equals to 8.21% of Asanko's outstanding shares. Given that approximately 60% of shares are owned by insiders and institutional investors, the extent of the short interest is pretty big. But the short-sellers can afford to be that aggressive, as they rely on the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDXJ) portfolio rebalancing. The rebalancing will weigh on the share prices of the junior miners, which should enable the short sellers to close their positions relatively comfortably. This is most probably also the reason why Asanko's share price hasn't fully recovered yet, although the results of the Esaase feasibility study and the updated mine plan indicate that Asanko is doing well and Muddy Waters' speculations were wrong. Also on the 15th page of its newest corporate presentation, Asanko Gold clearly states that the western wall failure hasn't impacted ore production and safety. An independent consultant, SRK, recommended to change the design of the pit in the failure area from 28 to 22 degrees, which means that additional 1.1 million tonnes of waste must be mined. As a result, the life-of-mine Nkran pit strip ratio should grow from 6.017 to 6.066, or by 0.8%. Removing 1.1 million tonnes of waste definitely won't cost $75-115 million, as speculated by Muddy Waters. The Feasibility Study The recently released results of the definitive feasibility study show that the Asanko mine expansion is economically viable, moreover there is a good probability that the company will be able to finance it from internal sources. The study includes two development stages: Project 5 million and Project 10 million.
 The Project 5M consists of upgrading of the current processing plant to 5 million tonnes per annum capacity, construction of a conveyor belt to the Esaase deposit and development of the Esaase deposit. The project 5M capex is estimated at $149.6 million. After the Project 5M is completed, the Asanko mine should be able to produce 230,000 toz gold, at an AISC of $968/toz, over a 20-year mine life. At a gold price of $1,250, the after-tax NPV(5%) is $658 million. The leverage to the gold price is really high, as gold price growth by $100 adds almost $200 million to the NPV. Construction of the Project 5M is underway, the expansion of the processing facility should be completed by Q4 2017. Also the preparation of the conveyor belt construction is underway. It is fully permitted and the bush clearing for the conveyor should be almost finished now. According to the May 4 news release, the conveyor belt as well as the Esaase deposit development should be completed in 2019. The Project 10M is another stage of expansion. It consists of increasing the processing plant capacity from 5 million to 10 million tonnes per annum and some additional investments into the Esaase deposit development. The Project 10 M capex is estimated at $199.7 million. After the Project 10M is completed, Asanko should be able to produce approximately 450,000 toz gold per year, at an AISC of $890/toz. The mine life should be approximately 12 years long. At a gold price of $1,250/toz, the after-tax NPV(5%) of the Project 10M is $811 million. Gold price growth by $100 boosts the NPV(5%) by $226 million. The date of the Project 10M completion is yet unknown. Although some of the calculations presented by the DFS assumed that it could be completed by 2021, Asanko's management intends to make the construction decision based on the market situation: s Project 10 Million is a modular expansion, Asanko has complete flexibility on its timing. A construction decision will be at the Board's discretion and will be dependent on both the successful commissioning and ramp-up of Project 5 Million, an optimized balance sheet, as well as positive market conditions.
 The main difference between the 5M and 10M projects is the speed of production. Over the life-of-mine, the same amount of gold should be produced in both of the scenarios. But in the case of 10M, the gold should be produced much quicker, which leads also to higher NPV and slightly lower AISC. 

 Source: own processing, using data of Asanko Gold Can Asanko Gold do it without share dilution? Yes it can. As of the end of Q1, Asanko Gold held cash & cash equivalents worth $65 million. The management expects that the company will be able to generate cash of another $51 million by the end of 2017. It means that Asanko Gold should have cash of around $90 million at the end of this year. If the current gold price prevails, the company should be able to generate operating cash flow of more than $100 million in 2018. 

 Source: own processing, using data of Asanko Gold If Asanko decides to follow the timetable projected by the DFS, it should invest $61.4 million into 5M in 2017, $69.8 million in 2018 and $18.5 million in 2019. The investments into 10M should equal to $14.7 million in 2018, $137.9 million in 2019 and $47.1 million in 2020. According to this schedule, the situation should be the most critical in 2019, when the combined 5M & 10M capex expenditures should equal $156.4 million. However, if the average realized gold price doesn't decline below $1,250 and if actual AISC and production volumes are not worse than projected, there is a good probability that Asanko Gold will be able to finance the whole expansion without further share dilution.
 The problem is only Asanko's debt facility. Back in 2013, Red Kite lent $150 million to Asanko Gold. The loan bears an interest rate of LIBOR+6%. The repayments will start on July 1, 2018, on a quarterly basis, and the whole debt should be repaid by July 1, 2020. During this period, Asanko will have to repay approximately $20 million every quarter. It means that if Asanko doesn't manage to refinance the Red Kite credit facility, it will have to postpone the Project 10M to 2020 or 2021. Conclusion The DFS confirms that the Esaase deposit is economical. Moreover, the costs related with the west wall collapse at the Nkran pit will be much smaller than predicted by Muddy Waters. Although the estimated Project 10M capex is higher compared to the PFS, the project is still very attractive, with an after-tax NPV (5%) of $811 million, at a gold price of $1,250. After the expansion of the Asanko mine is fully completed, Asanko Gold should produce around 450,000 toz gold per year, at an AISC of less than $900/toz. Although Asanko operates in Africa, which means that the market will apply lower multipliers to its share price, a profitable mid-tier gold producer should be worth more than $1 billion, not the current $317 million. The recent bear attack created a great opportunity for Asanko's shareholders to accumulate more shares.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Why Asanko Gold Is Crashing - Asanko Gold Inc. (NYSEMKT:AKG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Why Asanko Gold Is CrashingJun. 5.17 | About: Asanko Gold (AKG) Fabio Herrero Gold & precious metals, oil & gas, long only, Deep ValueSummaryNews that US Hedge Fund Muddy Waters was shorting Asanko pushed the shares down 31% in the United States and 13% in Canada on the morning of May 31, before rebounding.Muddy Waters released a 43-page report that detailed why the stock was worth zero. The main reason is the high grading of the mine with fatal consequences for it.K2, a Canadian hedge fund, is also very negative and is profitably shorting Asanko since June last year. The evidence brought forward includes an analysis of satellite images and grade.The West side of the main pit is already collapsing, and costs to go back to the original plan are expected to be more than $90m and are not budgeted.The arguments are compelling and the company will answer next week. This story is a great lesson for all mining investors. Shares of Asanko Gold Inc. (NYSEMKT:AKG) tumbled 13% in Toronto and 31% in New York on Wednesday the 31st of May 2017, before rebounding on Thursday. This happened after California-based hedge fund Muddy Waters released a negative report about the company. The report stated that Muddy Waters was shorting the stock due to high grading at the main mine pit and ore reconciliation problems at the miner's Ghana operations, coupled with a "significant risk" of a liquidity crisis in 2018. Muddy Waters is a known short seller, specialized in accounting fraud and due diligence of traded companies. In the 43 page report, Muddy Waters said that it expects Asanko to run out of cash in 2018 as it tries to service a $165m debt. Asanko CEO Peter Breese rebuffed all concerns in a statement shortly following the release of the report. "The Asanko Gold Mine is a robust business," he stated while reiterating the company's previous forecast that it would produce 230,000 to 240,000 ounces of gold this year. They expect this to generate between $64m and $77m in cash, assuming a $1,200 an ounce gold price. According to the press statement, the company will meet with its major shareholders on Pentecost Monday (June 5) for a previously organized two-week tour to discuss growth plans. The meetings will include updates on two projects, which Asanko forecasts will boost annual production in Ghana to 450,000 oz in 2020 from the current 220,000. This short article comprises three parts. Firstly, we will briefly assess Asanko's business and assets. After this, we will discuss what Muddy Waters and fellow Seeking Alpha contributor K2 have to say about Asanko, which should explain why the valuation is plummeting. Lastly, we will provide data showing that Asanko might also be a victim of the GDXJ (NYSEARCA:GDXJ) fund rebalancing debacle that also had dramatic effects on other stocks. Note that this is not a formal trade recommendation and that the article only serves to inform the reader and to provide useful links to start a due diligence. Asanko Gold Asanko is a development-stage gold miner that began commercial operations at its Asanko Gold Mine in April 2016. In 2017, it is expecting an estimated production of 230,000 to 240,000 oz Au. All operations are in Western Ghana, and the business plan stated that there will be a sequence of pits that will be mined, starting with the Nkran Pit (see below). A conveyor belt is planned between the major Esaase pit and the processing facilities near the Nkran pit (Company Website). 

 The company sports a - for open pits - relatively high grade portfolio of pits after some M&A in the last 5 years. The Nkran pit is the one currently in production and is also the one creating the troubles previously referenced to. Total Mineral Resource estimate (Company Website). NB In the Notes it is stated that cutoff is 0.5g/t within a $2000 oz Au pit shell. 

 Short seller 1, Hedge Fund Muddy Waters Muddy Waters' trading outlook is that the company's shares will drop to zero. The fund notes that Asanko's liquidity was limited to $48m of cash on hand, with no availability on its $150m revolver credit. Using 'company-favorable assumptions', they estimate that Asanko will have a cash shortfall ranging from $43m to $129m in 2018. Muddy Waters' report can be freely accessed here. Below you can see the Balance Sheet of the company. First Quarter Report for the period ending Mar 31, 2017 (for a complete version here). 

 When looking at the report, Muddy Waters' thesis can be synthesized in 5 main points:  Basing themselves on flawed geology, AKG made investments in Nkran, Esaase and other deposits, that the fund believes will never be recovered. Muddy Waters claims that the western Nkran wall suffered a significant collapse, something that seems to be confirmed by photographic evidence (see further below). Muddy Waters estimates that Asanko needs to spend $75 - $115m soon to push back and move the collapsed material as to avoid a mine "pinch out". This is a two-edged sword: spending this kind of money would likely mean that AKG will run out of liquidity in 2018, whereas not spending the money leaves the company without the cash flow to develop its largest deposit later, Esaase.  Asanko's satellite deposits are unlikely to yield significant cash flow due to assumed flawed geology. This was previously obscured due to the fact that in a December 2016 upgrade to their resources, AKG used a record gold price - $2,000/Oz - to boost their estimated value. This is clearly one of the most serious flaws as the gold price currently hovers around $1,265/Oz.  Muddy Waters believes to have found indications that some of AKG's resource models have been 'smeared', which would mean that estimates of their ore contents are inflated. Management is outwardly assured and confident, but their behavior reeks of desperation and short-termism.  Note furthermore that the capital cost to build Esaase is estimated at $100-110m. This money has to be provided from cash flow, while the company should essentially be lowering its long term debt before seeking refinancing next year. Asanko issued a mineral resource estimate in December 2016 that reduced the gold in its Nkran and Esaase deposits by a value of $581m and was "more in line with reality". This estimate is still flawed, however, due to the already cited highly inflated gold price it is based on. The original mine plan called to mine slowly and use the cash flow to develop the satellite deposits. What happened however is that the mine is being mined steeply where there is a higher grade portion, while deferring stripping because they are encountering lower grades in the halo around the higher grade core. This is in fact sterilizing the rest of the mine as it is less and less economical to take care of the long term ability to follow the high grade zones at depth as the surface is not being stripped using the cash flow from operations. At a point, there will be nothing to mine left accessible from surface and it will be too dangerous to mine at the bottom of the pit. This trade-off happens at all open pit mines, but should however not happen immediately after starting to mine. Moreover, plans should be made to keep track of it and deal with this as it is a well known problem. In this video interview at BNN, Carson Block, CEO of Muddy Waters, specifically affirms that the management's scrambling for mining shallow, nearby satellite deposits (see previous map), will not be sufficient to save the company. After Muddy Waters, let us now look at what the next short seller - and fellow Seeking Alpha contributor - K2 has to say about Asanko, as it is their belief that problems are even more systemic than outlined in the Muddy Waters report. Short Seller 2, Hedge Fund K2 K2 and associates is a Toronto based hedge fund that has shorted Asanko since June 2016 (and is hence making a nice profit already). It seems that the main reason for K2 to start shorting Asanko was the fact that its gold resources were overinflated. This applies specifically to its Nkran deposit, which Asanko acquired from Resolute Mining Ltd in 2014. 1y Asanko share price chart. 

 To my knowledge, K2 was the first to issue a report asserting that the geology of Nkran was not what was previously projected in the Feasibility Study. Here you can read the very compelling 33 page report. The report and the arguments brought forward were reiterated in this article from last February here on Seeking Alpha. The thesis is that Asanko is already high-grading the mine: in Q3 2016 Asanko appears to have mined ahead of schedule down the 'throat' of the orebody. By going deeper without moving the material around the ore (waste rock), it sterilizes future mining as it will be even less economical to move waste rock later, if there is less left to extract (K2 Presentation). 

 K2 pointed out that in the Feasibility Study, Nkran is supposed to be mined at an average annual rate of only 14.9Mtpa in 2017 & 2018.The company was supposed to strip the pit with one bigger shovel: the large CAT6030 with 10.1Mtpa of mining capacity and one smaller CAT6015 with 4.8Mtpa of mining capacity for the mining of the gold bearing ore. There is supposed to be a reduction of equipment in Nkran, but there are two of the big shovels working on site (K2 Presentation). 

What we can notice from the satellite photos, however, and what was also referred by Muddy Waters, is that not only are there two big shovels mining near the gold bearing structures, there are also waste rock movements that are being delayed. Furthermore, a part of the West wall has collapsed. Delayed development work and collapse on the West Side in the yellow circle (K2 Report). 

 K2 believes that the company is being selective with its data releases and that it is in effect borrowing future income to pay for today. This will eventually lead to a final crash when extraction of more gold will imply spending +70m dollars on stripping that was not done on time. 

 If all of this is indeed correct, Asanko is in a dire situation. Both short sellers believe that Asanko is not being transparent with the mining production path. They suspect that the company will not be able to refinance its debt in 2018, while also financing the new deposits with cash flow and strip what was not stripped on time at the Nkran pit. GDXJ and Asanko As a complete different topic, I want to signal here that on top of all company specific problems, Asanko is also caught up with the GDXJ re-balancing debacle. The ETF GDXJ has to sell shares - including of Asanko - and this could also push share prices lower till the 16th of June when the rebalancing will be over. There is also the possibility that Asanko will be delisted from some indexes and hence have a smaller pool of potential investors. GDXJ impact on single stocks (Source Macro Tourist). 

 For all readers the real question is the following: can Asanko find $160m to refinance the long term debt due next year + find $120m to build the next pits including Esaase + $90m to strip Nkran (if it is even worth at this point and at this gold price)? If you think it is possible, then Asanko is probably a buy at these prices, if not, then you could join the shorts.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
