Ladd Seaberg Retires From MGP Ingredients, Inc. Board: Karen Seaberg Appointed to Fill Vacancy; John Speirs Named Board Chairman




















August 28, 2009 08:00 ET

 | Source: MGP Ingredients Inc.





ATCHISON, Kan., Aug. 28, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ladd Seaberg has announced his retirement as a member and chairman of the Board of Directors of MGP Ingredients, Inc., (Nasdaq:MGPI) effective at the close of business yesterday. However, he will remain available in a consulting capacity to the board and company management for a period of approximately two years. Seaberg, 63, a director for 30 years and chairman since October 2006, said his decision to step down from board service was based on his desire "to focus additional time on other non-business-related activities and priorities" and was "partially influenced by health-related reasons."


Seaberg's wife, Karen, local business entrepreneur and community leader, was appointed by directors to fill his vacancy on the board and has been nominated to complete his current term, which expires in October 2011. Directors also selected longtime business executive and consultant John Speirs, a member of MGPI's board since 2004, to succeed Seaberg as board chairman. Speirs becomes the fourth individual and first non-relative of the Cray family to hold this position. The late Cloud L. Cray, Sr., who founded the company in 1941, served as the first chairman. He was followed by his son, Cloud L. "Bud" Cray, and then Seaberg, Bud Cray's son-in-law.


"As I exit the board, I do so with the utmost confidence in Karen's and John's abilities, as well as those of our other directors, to help lead this company forward during these extremely challenging times that our entire economy faces," Seaberg said. "With the support and dedication of the outstanding personnel we have throughout the organization, they and MGP Ingredients will succeed in carrying on the proud and progressive legacy that began here 68 years ago."


Seaberg, who spent 37 years in active management with the company, served as president of MGPI from 1980 to 2006, as well as chief executive officer during the last 20 of those years.


"I have been associated with MGP Ingredients throughout my entire professional career and have participated in numerous significant changes over the course of the company's evolvement, including several major expansion projects, plant and technological upgrades, product diversifications and, more recently, an extensive internal restructuring process," Seaberg noted. "It certainly has been a very exciting and rewarding experience and I am deeply grateful to everyone for the hard work and support they have provided during my many years in leadership positions at the company."


Karen Seaberg, who, like her husband and father, has a longstanding attachment to the company, said she is "deeply honored and grateful" to be chosen for membership on the board. "I look forward to my new responsibilities and the opportunity to serve this outstanding company in such a capacity," she said. "I have gained an in depth understanding of MGPI's business operations, markets and strategic initiatives through the years and am enthusiastic about performing a key role as a director for the good of all who have a stake in our company's future."


In stepping into the chairman's role, Speirs stated that "it gives us great pleasure to welcome Karen as the newest member of the board, where we know she will add tremendous insight and value to our decision-making functions and processes." He also expressed gratitude on behalf of fellow directors for "Ladd's countless contributions to the company and his exemplary leadership and management style, both as an executive and in his capacity at the helm of the board." Speirs added that he feels "highly honored and privileged" to be selected by his board peers to succeed Seaberg as chairman. "Having the board's full confidence and support as I transition to the role of board chairman is an inspiring experience," he said. "I am eager to further demonstrate my deep commitment to this company through the opportunity to play a larger role in helping create greater value for our customers, stockholders and employees."


Other current members of MGPI's board include Cloud L. "Bud" Cray; Michael Braude, retired chairman of the Board of Trade of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.; John Byom, co-owner and chief executive officer of Classic Provisions, Inc., Plymouth, Minn.; J. Gary Gradinger, chairman and chief executive officer of Golden Star, Inc., Kansas City, Mo.; Linda Miller, marketing consultant and faculty member of the University of Kansas, Lawrence; Tim Newkirk, president and chief executive officer of MGP Ingredients; and Daryl Schaller, Ph.D., president of Schaller Consulting, Homosassa, Fla.

John Speirs is chairman and co-founder of Stellus Consulting, a Minneapolis-based firm that specializes in developing business and branding strategies. He was first elected to the Board of Directors of MGP Ingredients in October 2004 by holders of the company's common stock. He was re-elected to a new three-year term on the board in 2007. Earlier this year, Speirs was appointed lead director by the board to actively assist company President and CEO Tim Newkirk in the execution of MGPI's recently initiated business transformation strategy. "John has been very instrumental in providing solid guidance in our efforts to reshape the company into one that is consistently profitable," Newkirk said. "His professional background and expertise in the development and implementation of strategic initiatives have proven to be highly valuable to our company as we embark on a more well-defined course for future value creation."


Prior to co-founding Stellus Consulting in 2001, Speirs spent 30 years as a food and household products executive. From 1998 to 2000, he served as executive vice president of marketing for Diageo PLC. During that time, he developed and implemented a corporate approach to business strategy, innovation, branding and marketing effectiveness for Diageo and its operating units, including Pillsbury, United Distillers and Vintners, Guinness and Burger King.


Between 1989 and 1998, Speirs held a series of senior level positions at Pillsbury, the last being senior vice president of strategy and brand development. In that capacity, he developed corporate strategy, including merger and acquisition activities that resulted in industry leading growth, and developed and led systems for the management of global brand equities. Prior positions with Pillsbury included president of Pillsbury International and SVP Strategy (1992-94); president of Green Giant (1990-92), a division of Pillsbury, and senior vice president of marketing development (1989-90).

Dec 22, 2014
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Karen Seaberg Elected to Chair MGP’s Board of Directors

ATCHISON, Kan., December 22, 2014--The Board of Directors of MGP Ingredients, Inc. (Nasdaq/MGPI) has announced the election of Karen Seaberg as board chairperson effective immediately. Her election continues a long family legacy at the company, a leading supplier of premium distilled spirits and specialty wheat proteins and starches.
In chairing the board, Mrs. Seaberg succeeds her father, Cloud L. “Bud” Cray, who served as chairman during this past year, as well as from 1980 to 2005. He retains a position on the board as chairman emeritus.  Her husband, Ladd Seaberg, was chairman from 2005 until his retirement in 2009 and also served a combined total of 28 years as president and CEO. The role of chairman was originally held by Mrs. Seaberg’s late grandfather, Cloud L. Cray, Sr., who founded the company in 1941.
“While remaining an active member of the board, I have decided to step down as chair as we prepare for the start of a new year,” Bud Cray said. “MGP has made significant progress during this past year thanks to the hard work of our talented management team and employees, along with the high caliber Board that we have in place.”
Cray continued, “We are very excited for Karen, whose outstanding record of accomplishments now includes being the first female to serve as board chair at MGP. She possesses a solid understanding of MGP’s business, and has repeatedly demonstrated her remarkable leadership skills on many fronts. The entire board shares my confidence in her abilities to provide valuable guidance and insight pertinent to decisions that are in the best interest of our shareholders, customers and employees, as well as the communities of which we are a part. Her optimistic attitude, perseverance and integrity are additional qualities that will serve all stakeholders well as she fulfills the responsibilities of her new position on the board."
Mrs. Seaberg became a director of MGP in 2009, filling a vacancy that resulted from her husband’s retirement from the board. Her professional background includes over 20 years as an executive travel agent in association with the Travel Center of Atchison. Along with her husband, she is co-owner of a local Long John Silver’s franchise.  She also served for five years on the managing executive committee of the former RiverHouse Restaurant in Atchison.
“I am deeply grateful for the faith my fellow directors have in my capabilities to serve as chairperson of MGP’s board,” Mrs. Seaberg said. “As one might imagine, I have had a strong attachment to the company since my earliest days. This connection has only become more solid through the years, increasing my desire and determination to do what is right and best for all who have an interest in MGP’s success.”
Widely recognized for her involvement in civic activities, Mrs. Seaberg performed a key role at the local, state and national levels in the development of the 2004 Lewis & Clark Bicentennial commemoration, including serving on the executive committee for “A Journey Fourth,” one of 15 Lewis & Clark Bicentennial Signature events held nationally in 2004. In addition to other positions she held in relation to bicentennial activities, she was a member of the National Lewis & Clark Trail Heritage Foundation Board from 2003 to 2007 and served as its president from 2007 to 2008.
Mrs. Seaberg was very active in Atchison’s award-winning Riverfront/Downtown Development project, serving on the Design Committee from 1997 to 2000 and the Development Committee from 2000 to 2004. She is a charter member of the Riverfront Development Foundation, which was organized in 2005.
Mrs. Seaberg also continues to perform a lead role in Atchison’s nationally-acclaimed Amelia Earhart Festival, which attracts an estimated 50,000 guests to the local community each year. She served as a member of the Governor’s Committee for the Amelia Earhart Birthday Centennial in 1997. She additionally was a principal organizer and events coordinator for the centennial festival in Atchison in 1997 and has served as festival chair since then.
Her community involvement over the years spans many other entities and programs, including the Atchison Area Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors and Tourism Council, Atchison Family YMCA Capital Campaign Cabinet, Atchison Hospital Board of Directors, Riverbend Regional Healthcare Board, and the Board of the Cray Medical Research Organization at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kan.

Biography



    Ms. Seaberg is a member of the Heartland chapter of NACD and has been an executive travel agent and minority owner of Travel Center of Atchison for 28 years. She is also co-owner of a Long John Silver's franchise in Atchison, Kansas. Ms. Seaberg is active in civic affairs at both the local and national level. She was instrumental in the creation of Atchison's $4.8 million Riverfront Park in 2004 and was the Kansas Governor's Chair for the national Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration in 2002-2006, bringing one of 15 national events to Atchison, Leavenworth and Kansas City in 2004. She also served on the Lewis & Clark Trail Heritage Foundation board, a national not-for-profit based in Great Falls, MT, from 2003 to 2007 and as its national president from 2007 to 2008. Ms. Seaberg has been the chair of the annual Amelia Earhart Festival since 1997, which brings over 40,000 people to Atchison every year in July. Ms. Seaberg served on the Atchison Hospital Board from 1990 to 2004, and presently serves on the Board of the Cray Medical Research Organization at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, a position she has held since 1995. In 2015, she was recipient of the Hall of Fame award from the Chamber of Commerce and the Vision of Excellence award from the Santa Fe Depot Trustees in Atchison, Kansas. She is the cousin of George W. Page, Jr. The Company believes that Ms. Seaberg's qualifications to serve on the Board include her business and civic experience and organizational skills, her knowledge of the Company and the industries in which it operates, her familiarity with the community in which the Company operates and her significant stock ownership.
