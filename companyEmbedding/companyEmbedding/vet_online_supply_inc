Vet Online Supply Launches Cannabis CBD Pet Product Line CommentsJuly 20, 2017 - SAN DIEGO, CA Vet Online Supply, Inc. (OTC PINK: VTNL) (the Company), announces today that is has begun the launch of the first round of CBD Pet Products while preparing several more brand name products owned by the company. The company is now selling and shipping its own cannabis product line, in addition to its legacy veterinarian supplies line. The newest of the products are the Pet Drops, and the Pet Treats. CBD pet drops can help with arthritis, compromised immune systems, stress responses, aggression and digestive issues. Veterinarians are also finding CBD hemp can be useful in treating acute ailments like sprains and strains, torn ligaments, bone breaks and even during post-operative care to reduce swelling, pain and stiffness. Matt Scott, Director, stated "Our new products are high-grade CBD and lab tested with maximum performance using 5mg dosages and liquid drops for the best results. The pet market is changing and CBD has gained acceptability. The presence and regulatory role of the endocannabinoid system in all animals has been confirmed by scientific studies. Like humans, animals produce endocannabinoids that act on specific receptors that are found throughout the body, and regulate various physiological roles. In diseased states, the activation of these receptors with phytocannabinoids could be helpful to treat the underlying problem. Cannabinoids, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), has the potential to treat various medical problems, in a non-toxic way. THC may be harmful for pets, and it may also cause psychoactive effects. No study has ever reported CBD is harmful to pets, but rather it is beneficial in many ways. Not all, but most, of the edible canine cannabis treats are virtually THC-free, completely non-psychoactive and non-toxic to pets. These edible treats are derived from hemp, instead of marijuana, due to legal issues." ABOUT VET ONLINE SUPPLY: Vet Online Supply Inc. is a US based online retail reseller of premium veterinary supplies. The goal of "Vet Online Supply" is to provide the $38B industry with value priced, superior quality products. Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements: This news release includes forward-looking statements. While these statements are made to convey to the public the company's progress, business opportunities and growth prospects, readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements represent management's opinion. Whereas management believes such representations to be true and accurate based on information and data available to the company at this time, actual results may differ materially from those described. The Company's operations and business prospects are always subject to risk and uncertainties. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ are and will be set forth in the company's periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Quote:Vet Online Supply Launches Cannabis CBD Pet Product Line   Clinical studies prove effectiveness of cannabidiol in treating canine ailments  SAN DIEGO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 07/20/17 -- Vet Online Supply, Inc. (OTC PINK: VTNL) (the Company), announces today that is has begun the launch of the first round of CBD Pet Products while preparing several more brand name products owned by the company.   The company is now selling and shipping its own cannabis product line, in addition to its legacy veterinarian supplies line. The newest of the products are the Pet Drops, and the Pet Treats. CBD pet drops can help with arthritis, compromised immune systems, stress responses, aggression and digestive issues. Veterinarians are also finding CBD hemp can be useful in treating acute ailments like sprains and strains, torn ligaments, bone breaks and even during post-operative care to reduce swelling, pain and stiffness.   Matt Scott, Director, stated "Our new products are high-grade CBD and lab tested with maximum performance using 5mg dosages and liquid drops for the best results. The pet market is changing and CBD has gained acceptability. The presence and regulatory role of the endocannabinoid system in all animals has been confirmed by scientific studies. Like humans, animals produce endocannabinoids that act on specific receptors that are found throughout the body, and regulate various physiological roles. In diseased states, the activation of these receptors with phytocannabinoids could be helpful to treat the underlying problem. Cannabinoids, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), has the potential to treat various medical problems, in a non-toxic way. THC may be harmful for pets, and it may also cause psychoactive effects. No study has ever reported CBD is harmful to pets, but rather it is beneficial in many ways. Not all, but most, of the edible canine cannabis treats are virtually THC-free, completely non-psychoactive and non-toxic to pets. These edible treats are derived from hemp, instead of marijuana, due to legal issues."   ABOUT VET ONLINE SUPPLY:   Vet Online Supply Inc. is a US based online retail reseller of premium veterinary supplies. The goal of "Vet Online Supply" is to provide the $38B industry with value priced, superior quality products.

Five Reasons Why We Love Mutts
Thursday, July 27, 2017 4:58:42 PM EST5EDT


 
July 31st is National Mutt Day, but we think that mutts deserve our love every day. Unfortunately, medium and large-sized mutts represent the largest percentage of dogs that are euthanized, which is a shame as mutts are great dogs to own. If you own a mutt, you already know how awesome these dogs can be, but we wanted to take a second and let everyone else in on the secret.
 
What Is a Mutt?
 
A mutt is a mixed breed dog. Mutts come in all shapes and size. They make up 75% of all dogs in shelters, and they are more likely to go un-adopted or become homeless than purebreds. National Mutt Day takes place on two dates, July 31st and December 2nd, to raise awareness about mutts and encourage the general public to adopt them at local shelters.
 
Why Should You Adopt a Mutt?
 
There are many more reasons to adopt a mutt than five, but we know you’re busy. If you’re thinking about adopting a dog, here are some great reasons why you should adopt a mutt:
 
You will have a dog like no other: No two mutts are the same. Mutts have unique fur colors and patterns, and their features will vary. If you want a dog that will turn heads and get compliments on walks or at the dog park, adopting a mutt is the way to go.
 
Mutts are generally healthier: Mutts are made up from a diverse gene pool, so they are less prone to specific diseases that affect certain breeds. This means they are generally healthier and live longer.
 
Your mutt will be more flexible: Some purebreds have strong programming to be in a specific environment, have a well-defined temperament, and perform certain tasks. Mutts don’t have such strong programming, so they are more likely to be cool with a variety of different environments, making them the perfect housemate.
 
You will pay less to adopt a mutt: If costs are a concern, mutts are the way to go. You can adopt a mutt at a shelter for a few hundred dollars. A purebred could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars more.
 
You will be saving a life: As we mentioned mutts make up the majority of dogs in animal shelters. When you adopt a mutt, you are saving a life, so we can think of no stronger reason to bring a mutt into your home.
 
At Vet Supply Source, we have dog grooming supplies and more to keep your dog looking his or her best. We also carry flea and tick prevention for dogs to ensure your dog stays healthy. We guarantee that your mutt will appreciate it, and he or she will give you back so much more in kisses. We encourage you to learn more about National Mutt Day here.

Five Things You Need before You Adopt a Shelter Cat
Monday, June 19, 2017 3:46:35 PM EST5EDT


 
So you decided that now is the time to adopt a shelter cat? We commend you on your decision – especially since June is National Adopt a Shelter Cat Month. Unfortunately, far too many cats do not get adopted, and shelters across the country are full. National Adopt a Shelter Cat is an awareness campaign where the public can get educated on adoption and the many benefits that come with it. 
 
However, before you go to the shelter to pick up your furry friend, we just wanted to take a second and talk about a few of the things you will need. The first few days of cat ownership can be difficult for both you and the cat. Oftentimes, cats will need some time to get used to their surroundings. They may find a hiding spot and stay there for a while until they’re ready to come out and introduce themselves formally. By preparing in advance, you can make the transition much easier. But what cat supplies should you buy beforehand? Here are a few musts that your cat will appreciate.
 
A Litter Box or Two: The rule of thumb is to have a litter box for every cat you own plus an extra one. So, if this is your first cat, you will need two. You will need cat litter too. Clumping litter is preferable as it will neutralize any odors. In addition to that, non-clumping cat litter often contains silica, which is a big no-no for you and your cat.
 
A Scratching Post: Cats need to scratch. If they don’t have a scratching post, they will use your furniture or carpet. It is much cheaper to just buy a post rather than all new furniture.
 
A Cat Carrier: You will need a carrier to take your cat to the vet, which is something you should do in the first week you adopt a cat. Also, a cat carrier often serves as a good resting spot for your cat; cats love small spaces.
 
Cat Toys: Cats are predators, which means they are always on the hunt. Since they are now indoors, they will need something to do. Cat toys satisfy their instinctual hunting drive, and they are also a way for your cat to get some exercise and mental stimulation.
 
Food: The long-term health of your cat will largely be determined by what you feed him or her. Cats are carnivores, which means they have different dietary needs than humans or even dogs. Your cat, unfortunately, can’t become a vegan. Ask your vet what food he or she would recommend and be sure to keep your cat on a regular feeding schedule. And don’t get scared if your cat doesn’t want to eat for the first day or two. It’s all part of the adjustment period.

Why Preventing Fleas Is So Much Easier than Treating an Infestation
Wednesday, May 17, 2017 10:50:48 AM EST5EDT


 
The weather is getting warm, which means flea prevention is all the more important if you own a dog. If you haven’t treated your dog for fleas over the winter and have been lucky so far, consider yourself just that –lucky!  Fleas enjoy this time of year as it’s not too warm yet but it is warm enough where there won’t be a freeze. They typically fare best in moist, cool places like your shrubs, trees, and leaf piles. And guess where dogs like to sniff around and do their business?
 
Why It’s So Hard to Treat an Infestation
 
Fleas can jump onto your dog anytime your dog goes outside. Even if your dog only goes out for a minute to use the bathroom, this is plenty of time for fleas to hop on board. You can also bring fleas into the home, as fleas can get on your socks or clothing if you head outdoors.
 
Once they come into your house, fleas make themselves at home. The typical flea can lay up to 40 eggs per day, and those eggs may hatch in days, weeks, or months. In fact, 57% of the fleas in any given home are in the larval stage and may remain so for months. If there is an infestation, it is imperative that it is treated as quickly as possible as fleas can spread diseases to both pets and humans. In many cases, the household will have to call pest control to completely get rid of the problem, which could be prohibitively expensive as well as frustrating.
 
This is why we think it’s best that you pay attention to prevention so you don’t have to worry about treating an infestation. First and foremost, get flea treatment for your dogs so they are protected if fleas try to attach to them. If you are unsure of which medication would work best, you should consult your veterinarian to see what he or she thinks.
 
In addition, you should try to vacuum as much as possible. As fleas are in cocoons in our carpeting, bedding, couches, and linens, vacuuming and cleaning these and other parts of your household could significantly reduce the amount of fleas in your home. Don’t forget to clean up the areas where your dog likes to hang out and sleep; clean these spots often as fleas will tend to be found here in numbers as well.

Five Reasons to Adopt a Pet on National Adopt a Shelter Pet Day
Tuesday, April 18, 2017 12:30:22 PM EST5EDT


 
On April 30th, shelters across the country will hopefully see lines out the door as it will be National Adopt a Shelter Pet Day. At Vet Supply Source, we love our adopted furry friends, and we hope many more find homes in the upcoming weeks. Obviously, owning a pet comes with many responsibilities, but if you have thought about it and think you’re ready, you may want to consider adopting a pet. Here are a few reasons why we think it’s a great idea to adopt.
 
You’ll Save a Life: One of the main reasons why National Adopt a Shelter Pet Day was established was to create awareness about how overcrowded our shelters currently are. Did you know that more than 2.7 million cats and dogs are unfortunately euthanized every year due to overcrowded shelters? This number could be reduced dramatically if more people decided to adopt.
 
You’ll Save Money: Speaking of saving, the cost of adopting a pet is usually much less than buying one from a store or breeder. The adoption price will often cover many upfront costs, including spaying/neutering, initial vaccines, microchipping, and more.
 
You’ll Feel Better: You won’t just feel better about saving a life; you may feel better physically and emotionally too. All pets, but especially adopted pets, give their new family unconditional love, which in turn can lower stress levels and provide owners with a greater sense of purpose. Plus, those walks every day will help you get off the couch more as well.
 
You’ll Be Saved the Troubles of Housetraining: This will depend on a number of factors, but, in many cases, adoptable cats and dogs are already housetrained, which will save you and your household the trouble.
 
You’ll Help More than One Animal: Remember when we said that our shelters are overcrowded? When you adopt a cat or a dog from a shelter, you won’t just save the immediate life of the pet you decide to adopt. You will also make room so another cat or dog can potentially get adopted too.
 
What to Do before You Adopt
 
Before you adopt, it might be a good idea to plan ahead of time. You will need dog grooming supplies, toys, food, and/or cat supplies, a place your pet can call its own to eat and sleep, a vet whom you like, and more. If you have other pets, they will need to be introduced slowly to the new furry member of the household as well. While it sometimes can some take time for the new dog or cat to get adjusted, we’re sure he or she will get acclimated before you know it.

Four Tips for Keeping Your Pet's Breath Smelling Fresh
Monday, April 17, 2017 10:46:22 AM EST5EDT

If you don't brush your teeth and floss, you're going to hear it from your dentist. Regular brushing and flossing as well as avoiding added sugars and acidic foods is the best prescription for healthy teeth and gums. When you skip maintenance or regular dentist visits, this is when you run into trouble.
The same holds true for your pets. If you notice that your pet's breath is getting a little funkier of late, you shouldn't ignore it. Bad breath isn't just an annoyance; it could be a sign of a greater health condition. In addition to that, plaque and tartar buildup could potentially cause periodontal disease, which is painful for your pet and can spread to other organs in your pet's body.
So it's time to get serious about your pet's dental health. And now is a perfect time. February is National Pet Dental Health Month and what better way to celebrate than getting your pet's breath under control? If you're wondering where to start, here are a few tips to keep in mind:
Start Slowly with the Introduction to Brushing: Unless you are the luckiest pet owner in the world, your cat or dog is not going to welcome the toothbrush with open paws. It's going to be a slow process that will probably involve a lot of treats. Let them smell the brush and touch it and then reward them with a treat. Slowly get them comfortable to the point where you can brush their teeth for about thirty seconds on each side. If they get scared or bite or claw you, you might have to start again or try a different route.
Purchase Dental Treats, Toys, and Food: Although these are not as effective as brushing, they can help. Just be sure they are designed for oral health and have been certified by the Veterinary Oral Health Council.
Use a Dental Rinse: Dental rinses are becoming increasingly popular for pets that have no interest in having their teeth brushed. Ask your veterinarian if this is an option. Speaking of that…
Take You Pet to the Vet for a Dental Exam: Your vet will review your pet's history and examine the pet for any issues. Your vet will look for inflamed gums, chipped teeth, plaque and tartar, and more.  Your vet will also check your pet for lumps and other symptoms to rule out cancer and other harmful conditions that could be affecting dental health. He or she may also recommend a cleaning, which, although will require sedation, may help your pet significantly in the long run.
Are you looking for affordable pet supplies online for your pet's dental health? Vet Supply Source has you covered. Find pet oral health toothbrushes and other supplies at the best prices in our online store.

Three Things You Should Know before Adopting a Puppy
Thursday, March 23, 2017 10:49:55 AM EST5EDT

Did you know that March 23rd is National Puppy Day? This year marks the tenth anniversary of the event, which aims to educate the public on adoption and issues with puppy store and backyard breeders. If you do decide to buy a puppy from a purebred breeder, be sure to research beforehand to make sure the breeder is licensed and has a good reputation in the breeding community.
But there are millions of puppies in shelters right now waiting to go to their furever home, so why not just adopt instead? That is the main message the organizers of National Puppy Day wanted to show, and we encourage you to check out their official website to learn more about adoption. If you are considering adopting a puppy, we would also like you to consider the following to make sure now is the best time to bring a new puppy into your home:
Are You Allowed to Have a Pet? If you own a single family home, you probably have more options here. But many people rent, and leases may have specific rules in place regarding pet ownership. If you live with your parents, roommates, or siblings, you should consult with them as well as they will be affected by a new puppy living with them too. You may have to negotiate with your landlord or roommates to make it work for everyone involved.
Can You Afford to Own a Puppy? Owning a pet requires a significant financial commitment for fifteen years or even more. There is the adoption fee, but this is only the beginning. Your pup will need to go to the vet for shots, wellness visits, and when he or she gets sick. Your pup will need food, toys, and treats as well as potentially professional training and dog walking and grooming services. While there are ways to find savings online for dog supplies, you should budget beforehand to make sure you are able to afford the costs of puppy/dog ownership.
Do You Really Want a Puppy? Owning a puppy and later a dog requires more than just a financial commitment. It requires significant time and availability as well. Your pup will need to be walked several times a day, will need to be trained on basic good behavior, and will require house training unless you want to cover your home in plastic. Puppies are very cute, but they need your time, attention, and energy. For those who can provide these things, puppy ownership is truly wonderful, but make sure you can before you make a trip out to the shelter.

Mark Your Calendars For Adopt A Shelter Pet Day
Tuesday, April 12, 2016 8:55:41 AM EST5EDT

Are you thinking about getting a pet? If so, April 30th is the perfect day  - you can participate in National Adopt-A-Shelter-Pet Day! Millions of companion animals are looking for forever homes in shelters all across the country. Adopting a furry friend from your local animal shelter will give you all the joy and happiness you've been looking for!
While you could certainly adopt a companion animal any time of the year, the special day aims to raise awareness of the number of pets currently in need of pet parents to avoid euthanasia. The unfortunate reality is that local animal shelters have a limited amount of resources to cover expenses and foster pet parents just don't have the space to save every animal.
With that in mind, adopting a companion animal from a shelter gives the pet a chance to be happy and live a long, healthy life. Plus, there are few relationships that are as unconditional and strong than that of the bond between an owner and pet. Pet parents know that their devoted furry friends will be there for them if they are sad, happy, sick, healthy or moody – pets are a great source of long-term companionship. Since there are a few weeks until the annually celebrated day arrives, you have plenty of time to prepare for an adoption. Below are some tips to get everything you need ready if you decide to adopt!
What Kind Of Pet Do You Want?
Animal shelters are typically full of both cats and dogs, so it really comes down to what type of pet you would like to join your family. But, you need to consider which animal will best fit your lifestyle and schedule. You need to keep in mind that cats and dogs require different types of care and attention. For instance, dogs need to be taken outside for potty breaks, whereas cats typically use the litterbox. These are the types of considerations that prospective pet parents need to factor in when choosing between a cat and a dog.
Purchase Pet Supplies
As a general rule of thumb, you want to make sure you purchase pet supplies online before you bring your pet home from the shelter. These essentials include grooming supplies like brushes, pet shampoo, vitamins, and supplements, as well as flea and tick medication. Additionally, you will need food and water bowls, toys, a pet bed, a collar, a leash, a litterbox and other necessities for your new pet.
Spend Time With Your New Pet
When you first arrive home with your new cat or dog, it may take some time for them to get assimilated to their new surroundings, so your pet may be shy in the very beginning. With that said, spend ample time with your new addition so they can feel comfortable and loved, and before you know it, you'll see their full personality! If you've adopted an older shelter pet, they may already be eager to play, so be prepared to provide endless entertainment.

National Puppy Day: Adopting A Healthy Puppy
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 10:23:37 AM EST5EDT

March 23rd is National Puppy Day and it's aimed at celebrating puppies and promoting adoption for the millions of pooches who are looking for forever homes. When it comes to picking up a furry friend, there are a few ways you can go about it – head to the local animal shelter, check out a pet store, search online or look at the classified ads in the newspaper. While all seem like viable options, there are some red flags you need to be aware of because puppy mills and backyard breeders are becoming more problematic all across the country.
The unfortunately reality is that many people are unknowingly supporting these 'black market' practices and you should know how to identify the red flags associated with them. First, a puppy mill is a large-scale commercial dog breeding compound that puts a priority on profit over the well-being of the dogs. Backyard breeders are people who breed animals, often without proper registration and in some cases, produce inbred puppies for looks with little to no regard to their health.
In both cases, these poor animals can suffer from a slew of health problems, which in turn can result in significant medical care costs because medicine for dogs is expensive. You want to be sure you get a healthy puppy that hasn't been exposed to diseases or environmental conditions which may affect their well-being. While all dogs deserve a good home, you can do your part to help and still find an adorable puppy along the way. Here are some tips for finding a new puppy!
Know the Signs Of A Puppy Mill
Puppy mills generally house dogs in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions without sufficient food, water or veterinary care. Some puppy mills will have cages upon cages of animals, and the cages have only wire flooring, which injuries the puppies’ paws and legs. If you visit a property like this to look at puppies in these conditions, it's definitely a red flag. Instead, consider leaving and calling the police to report that the animals are in unsafe conditions. Additionally, the local animal control department may also be able to step in for help.
Know the Difference Between Breeders
Like mentioned above, there are 'backyard breeders', which breed dogs in an irresponsible manner that puts the focus on profit rather than the well-being of the dog. With that in mind, it's important to understand the differences between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible one.
Responsible breeders don't sell their puppies to or through pet stores because they personally want to screen and select the homes for their puppies. They will take many factors into consideration when selecting an adoptive family, and will turn people away if their lifestyle or home situation does not fall in line with the breed they are raising.
Additionally, responsible breeders don't sell multiple dog breeds; they typically only specialize in one or two main breeds and they will demonstrate an extensive knowledge on that breed's history, traits, conformation and temperament. On top of that, they will allow you to visit their home so you can see the dog's living conditions. They also have their dogs’ health evaluated frequently and make sure they are up-to-date on their shots. To make your search even easier, you can use the American Kennel Club's breeder referral search tool to find one in your area!
Finding a healthy puppy to take home just takes a little bit of research, and knowing where to adopt one can make a huge difference in your experience with your new pet Use the above tips when you search for your new puppy to find one that is a good fit for your home and your family!

Brush Up On Your Pets' Dental Health
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 8:58:26 AM EST5EDT

Most of us recognize the month of February for Valentine's Day, but did you know it is also Pet Dental Care Awareness Month? With that said, mark your calendars because it is time to brush up on some information about your pets' dental health! Many pet parents sometimes overlook their pets' oral care when it really is a very important aspect of their health. In fact, the American Veterinary Medical Association found that approximately 80% of dogs and 70% of cats show some signs of oral disease by the time they reach the age of three! They also mention that oral disease can contribute to serious health risks like dangerous infections of the vital organs.
With that in mind, the oral health of your pet is important to maintain and it is easier than you might think! Check out the following information about some simple steps to care for your pet and learn the signs and symptoms of dental disease!
Dental Care Tips
Brushing - Just as you would brush your own teeth on a daily basis, you should do the same for your pet! You can start an in-home regimen by brushing their teeth using pet toothbrushes and toothpastes that are safe for dogs and cats. It may take some time for your pet to get used to it, but, if you praise and reward them, it will become an easy to-do task. Plus, regular brushing helps reduce plaque and tartar build up.
Dental Exam – You should schedule a dental exam for your pet at least once a year; a veterinarian can provide your pet with a full dental examination to inspect their teeth and gums.
Oral Chews – You can help your pet remove plaque and food debris from their teeth with oral chews that are specifically designed to be nutritious and promote good oral health. Be sure to add oral chews to your list of dog or cat supplies so you can give them a treat that serves two purposes!
Toys & Rawhide Chews – Some other ways that you can help your pet maintain good oral health is through the use of chew toys and rawhide chews that have mild abrasive action to help wipe away thin layers of buildup on their teeth.
Signs of Dental Disease
In order to prevent dental disease, you have to make sure you apply the above care tips to your pet's health routine. You also need to know the signs and symptoms of dental disease to act quickly if you suspect a dental health issue.
Here are some common indicators of an oral health problem:

Bad breath
Discolored teeth, loose teeth or teeth covered in tartar
Bleeding from the mouth
Loss of appetite
Your pet isn't comfortable when you touch around their mouth area
Excessive drooling or the dropping of food from their mouth

If your pet has any of these dental disease indicators, you should schedule a veterinary exam right away.
You are now ready to maintain your pet’s oral health to help them enjoy a long and happy life!

Time To Celebrate National Walk Your Dog Month
Monday, January 18, 2016 2:28:41 PM EST5EDT

Vet Supply Source would like to welcome the New Year with all of our happy pet parents! 2016 is here and this year's motto can be out with the old and in with the new because January is the perfect time to start fresh with healthy resolutions. While many of us are planning to make healthier choices this year, you can even make that the resolution for your pet! That's right – not only does this month mark the start of new beginnings but it's also National Walk Your Dog Month and there's no better way to bring in the New Year!   
Taking your dog(s) out for a walk is not only beneficial to your health, but it also helps them in numerous ways. Check out these great reasons to get outside with your pup all year long!
Energy Outlet – every pet parent knows that their dogs can sometimes be a little wound up and full of energy, which means they can be a little disruptive when they are in the house. A nice walk can provide them with an outlet to calm their energy and settle their hyperactivity.
Training Aid – since a good walk will drain their energy and make them calmer, they will be more likely to focus on training. This, of course, helps with all types of training and makes it easier to teach them all sorts of commands. Additionally, the walk can serve as a training method to reinforce the bond between you and your pooch. Always remember that you are taking them for a walk and not the other way around, so be sure to maintain control during walks.
Burns Calories – according to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, 53% of dogs are overweight and that can cause a slew of health problems that may need to be treated by dog medications. However, you can help them burn those extra pounds by taking them for walks on a daily basis. (Also, 58% of cats are overweight and if you need medicine for your cats because of their weight, check out our previous article 3 Easy Ways To Fight Pet Obesity for tips to manage their weight too!)
Provides Social Stimulation – everyone wants their dog to welcome friends, family and other pets but they can be scared, suspicious or shy towards others if they don’t get to interact with strangers. Walks provide them with social stimulation and interaction because they are exposed to others, which will help them feel more comfortable around people and pets they don't know.
Lengthens Life – while walking may be a low-impact exercise, it will improve their well-being and build up beneficial health attributes that will lengthen their lifespan and improve their quality of life.                                                                                                                                                      
Provides Attention – your pet needs attention; they are sociable animals and when you take them for walks, you provide them with the interaction they want and crave.
Are you ready to take National Walk Your Dog Month in stride?

Perfect for any practice, any size.
Mobile, stationary and multi-location vets can now keep tabs on their records and clients.


 
We made the conversion to eVetPractice in December 2014 after 15 years with Cornerstone.  I have been very pleased with all aspects, including support, of this cloud-based system for both my referral and primary care practices.  The system can be easily customized to fit particular needs and there is a continual additions and improvements to the software based on the feedback from users.   Rick Wall, DVM, DACVSMR, CCRPOwner/Doctor - Animal Clinics of The Woodlands - The Woodlands, TX 


 
We are a modern, convenient and customer-focused Veterinary practice. eVetPractice allows us to be 100% paperless, creative with our communication and technology focused. We found the missing link we were looking for to increase our production while working with medical records, referral options, and appointment scheduling. The innovative design group, exceptional support staff and client focused team at eVetPractice are among the best in the business .  Audrey J Wystrach DVMOwner/Doctor - ZippiVet Pet Hospitals - Austin, TX 


 
eVetPractice is the best veterinary software available. If you are looking for a software for your clinic- stop looking and get eVet. Not only is the program itself incredible- online, cloud based, accessible from anywhere and with so many options available but the support is unreal. These guys will literally do everything they can to help every single customer. The software has made my practice so easy to run, saved me tons of money and is so dependable. The customer support is available with a live chat anytime you are having an issue and they bent over backwards for me to help me include French in the program and they would do the same for any clinic. I can't say enough good things about this software. Dr. James DrookerOwner/Doctor - Clinique Vétérinaire de Pointe St-Charles - Montréal, QC 


 
"For someone that has been a veterinary hospital owner since 1995 I came to the conclusion that I just had to suffer with less than adequate veterinary practice software until my business partner came across eVetPractice late last year. And boy am I glad he did. I know for all practice owners and office managers changing practice software can be horrifying because we all hate change BUT that's eVetPractice's strong suit - ease of changeover because of absolutely OUTSTANDING customer service." John MaddiganOwner/ Manager - Willamette Valley Animal Hospital - Keizer/Salem, Oregon 


 
“Our practice is run fully on laptops and tablets. We couldn't be happier with our choice especially because of the personalized, quick and friendly support provided by the tech support staff.” David Carmona, DVMOwner - Veterinary Wellness Center of Surfside - Surfside, FL 


 
“Going with eVetPractice has been a great decision for our practice. This is an innovative, reasonably priced software that we would definitely recommend to others.

We have never before dealt with such an amazing customer service staff. They not only guided us through the transition, but are now always ready to answer our questions.” Lisa CrabillOwner - Haslet Veterinary Clinic - Haslet, TX 


 
"eVetPractice is working quite well for us. We currently have two brick & mortar practices but chose eVetPractice more so because of our other "practices". We hold mobile vaccination clinics around the state and the web based software is saving us from the constant syncing of equipment that we had to do with our previous software. We have found eVP to be much more attentive to our needs as a unique veterinary practice. Because we have crews working around the state simultaneously, it creates situations for us that perhaps are not experienced by other clinics." Russell Bush, D.V.M. - Mark A. Vara, D.V.M.Vanguard Veterinary Associates - San Antonio, Texas 


 
"In retrospect, switching to a new Veterinary Management Software and going paperless, and changing some procedures and straightening out all of our messy data in only 6 weeks was a bit insane.

The smart thing we did was to have eVetPractice on site for training and go live. Although eVetPractice could not be more different than IDEXX Cornerstone, it is also very logical.

Our staff was amazing at picking up the new system and eVet's support was even better. " Jeff GorrOwner - Wausau Animal Hospital - Wausau, WI 


 
“Some strengths of eVetPractice include the amazing flexibility of setup for your individual practice, super-responsive customer/technical support, access to records online anywhere, and intuitive medical records. Every time we have asked for a specific functionality, the answer has been affirmative, and a solution has been created for our needs very quickly…" Dan Smith, DVMOwner - Alburtis Animal Hospital - Alburtis, PA 


 
"We converted from a 20 year old Veterinary Practice Management Software called AVS. It had 20 years of reminders, codes, and history. We were concerned about the conversion, but the eVetPractice team made it seamless. All of our data is intact. The interface is extremely intuitive. The customer service is unmatched. When there have been issues, we are constantly amazed at how fast they respond and update things. We took a risk in going with a small cloud based company, but we truly believe that this is the future. I am even more convinced that eVetPractice is the future." Dr. Tad MoseleyAnimal Health Center - Valdosta, Georgia

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Perfect for any practice, any size.
Mobile, stationary and multi-location vets can now keep tabs on their records and clients.


 
We made the conversion to eVetPractice in December 2014 after 15 years with Cornerstone.  I have been very pleased with all aspects, including support, of this cloud-based system for both my referral and primary care practices.  The system can be easily customized to fit particular needs and there is a continual additions and improvements to the software based on the feedback from users.   Rick Wall, DVM, DACVSMR, CCRPOwner/Doctor - Animal Clinics of The Woodlands - The Woodlands, TX 


 
We are a modern, convenient and customer-focused Veterinary practice. eVetPractice allows us to be 100% paperless, creative with our communication and technology focused. We found the missing link we were looking for to increase our production while working with medical records, referral options, and appointment scheduling. The innovative design group, exceptional support staff and client focused team at eVetPractice are among the best in the business .  Audrey J Wystrach DVMOwner/Doctor - ZippiVet Pet Hospitals - Austin, TX 


 
eVetPractice is the best veterinary software available. If you are looking for a software for your clinic- stop looking and get eVet. Not only is the program itself incredible- online, cloud based, accessible from anywhere and with so many options available but the support is unreal. These guys will literally do everything they can to help every single customer. The software has made my practice so easy to run, saved me tons of money and is so dependable. The customer support is available with a live chat anytime you are having an issue and they bent over backwards for me to help me include French in the program and they would do the same for any clinic. I can't say enough good things about this software. Dr. James DrookerOwner/Doctor - Clinique Vétérinaire de Pointe St-Charles - Montréal, QC 


 
"For someone that has been a veterinary hospital owner since 1995 I came to the conclusion that I just had to suffer with less than adequate veterinary practice software until my business partner came across eVetPractice late last year. And boy am I glad he did. I know for all practice owners and office managers changing practice software can be horrifying because we all hate change BUT that's eVetPractice's strong suit - ease of changeover because of absolutely OUTSTANDING customer service." John MaddiganOwner/ Manager - Willamette Valley Animal Hospital - Keizer/Salem, Oregon 


 
“Our practice is run fully on laptops and tablets. We couldn't be happier with our choice especially because of the personalized, quick and friendly support provided by the tech support staff.” David Carmona, DVMOwner - Veterinary Wellness Center of Surfside - Surfside, FL 


 
“Going with eVetPractice has been a great decision for our practice. This is an innovative, reasonably priced software that we would definitely recommend to others.

We have never before dealt with such an amazing customer service staff. They not only guided us through the transition, but are now always ready to answer our questions.” Lisa CrabillOwner - Haslet Veterinary Clinic - Haslet, TX 


 
"eVetPractice is working quite well for us. We currently have two brick & mortar practices but chose eVetPractice more so because of our other "practices". We hold mobile vaccination clinics around the state and the web based software is saving us from the constant syncing of equipment that we had to do with our previous software. We have found eVP to be much more attentive to our needs as a unique veterinary practice. Because we have crews working around the state simultaneously, it creates situations for us that perhaps are not experienced by other clinics." Russell Bush, D.V.M. - Mark A. Vara, D.V.M.Vanguard Veterinary Associates - San Antonio, Texas 


 
"In retrospect, switching to a new Veterinary Management Software and going paperless, and changing some procedures and straightening out all of our messy data in only 6 weeks was a bit insane.

The smart thing we did was to have eVetPractice on site for training and go live. Although eVetPractice could not be more different than IDEXX Cornerstone, it is also very logical.

Our staff was amazing at picking up the new system and eVet's support was even better. " Jeff GorrOwner - Wausau Animal Hospital - Wausau, WI 


 
“Some strengths of eVetPractice include the amazing flexibility of setup for your individual practice, super-responsive customer/technical support, access to records online anywhere, and intuitive medical records. Every time we have asked for a specific functionality, the answer has been affirmative, and a solution has been created for our needs very quickly…" Dan Smith, DVMOwner - Alburtis Animal Hospital - Alburtis, PA 


 
"We converted from a 20 year old Veterinary Practice Management Software called AVS. It had 20 years of reminders, codes, and history. We were concerned about the conversion, but the eVetPractice team made it seamless. All of our data is intact. The interface is extremely intuitive. The customer service is unmatched. When there have been issues, we are constantly amazed at how fast they respond and update things. We took a risk in going with a small cloud based company, but we truly believe that this is the future. I am even more convinced that eVetPractice is the future." Dr. Tad MoseleyAnimal Health Center - Valdosta, Georgia

Stephanie Heinz
Sales Manager

I started in customer service at age 15 and since have always focused on careers that involve working with people. My family and friends might say I was blessed with the “gift of gab”. I am a proud graduate of Georgia State University in the field of Risk Management and Insurance. However, I have spent most of my post college career in the software industry. I love the idea of structure and rules that comes with software. Okay, so mostly, finding ways to bend it to meet needs not thought of yet…
I am totally devoted to my two beautiful children, our wonderful dog, and the best husband in the world. You may know him as Eddie or “that guys that seems to have all the answers”. I also love to play indoor soccer and pretend to be young again once a week. If you are ever in Atlanta, let me know and I will have you drop by to watch a game and have a good laugh. I am the 4’10’’ red headed feisty one.
eVetPractice.com clients are like extra family members. I strive each day to make the family a great, big, happy one. You may meet me in the sales process, through our support chat, or on a training phone call. No matter how we meet, know that I will try my hardest, along with the rest of the eVetPractice.com team, to make choosing, learning, and using our practice management system an fantastic experience.

I go by “Mel” and yes it is short for Melissa.
My experiences come from 19 years of being a College Soccer Coach. I coached at all levels. My job was to mold young female adults on and off the field. The challenges that came from the job was finding ways to motivate, encourage, teach and problem solve for each student-athlete with different backgrounds. (Not to mention the recruiting, fundraising, community service, Athletic Events, and so much more outside the coaching aspect.) Coaching you have to invest in each person, it is not a 9-5 job.
What I bring to eVetPractice is; hard work, willingness to problem solve, motivate and encourage as you learn the system and endure change, invest in you and your practice and most of all bring energy because I love people and Animals! I was a proud owner of a 13.5 year old pound puppy name Shelby that was a 110 lb Lab mix.
Free time:
Kayaking, Mountain biking, Camping, Fishing, Friend time and Family time.
Important to me:

After a 4-year absence, I am pleased to rejoin many of my former coworkers to provide Raving Fan support to our customers.  My 15 plus years of experience has included running mainframe payroll systems, managing client-server networks, on-site installation and training of software, building a brand-new call center, and providing technical support that puts customers first.  I have managed to accomplish this in spite of having a Bachelor’s degree in Finance, which I only seem to have used to keep myself out of debt.  Originally from Western New York, think Buffalo not NYC, I relocated to the great state of Georgia after one too many winters.  My wife Charlene, a true southern belle, likes to tell people that I was just born in the wrong state.   When I am not working, you will find me out on the water with a fishing pole in one hand and an adult beverage in the other.

Debbie Amick
Raving Fans Trainer

I found myself very lucky at age 14 when life handed me a school-to-work opportunity at an animal hospital. How AWESOME! I LOVE animals AND I get to work with them? Sign me up! I rolled up my sleeves and got to work in the kennels until I made my way up to teching. Once I got there, I knew I had to make my life about helping people AND animals. I found that balance and passion in customer service and sales for a veterinary distributor in 2007 and the next 10 years were written! Meanwhile, I personally adore a techy/nerdy way of life; buying all the latest gadgets, learning and mastering all things technology and passing the knowledge down to others. So much so, I was considering a new path in life in IT. And then there it was, eVetPractice, the perfect combination of animal health and technology!!! It’s a perfect match and I couldn’t be any happier now that I am a part of the eVet family! When I’m not spending time with my eVet family, you can find me with my other family. We love spending our days exploring and traveling while doing photography, hiking, making music, longboarding and cooking. We also think our extremely spoiled puppy, Melee, is the prettiest, best dog in the world.

I strongly believe in direct, open communication with clients and coworkers and strive to find a win-win solution for every situation.

I’m a graduate of Clemson University and bring over 19 years of administrative support and customer service. Through my experience I effectively correspond with clients and use sound judgement when resolving issues.
In my free time I love to be outdoors on the lake or in the woods. I have been an animal lover my entire life and you can regularly find me among the sheep, llamas and cows at the farm my wonderful husband of 17 years manages.
Although I have lost my two buddies 16 year old Bugsy and 11 year old Cabet, I look forward to loving a new family member soon.







How it all beganOur history and how we became who we are today.
eVetPractice began back in 2011 when our owner and founder, Eddie Heinz, was tasked by his sister-in-law to find an affordable practice management solution that offered the necessary features to run the new mobile practice she was beginning. Dr. Kristen Arp had worked in corporate medicine for some time and knew the value of properly managing her business, but like most veterinarians, did not have a background in software and was concerned about making the right choice. Fortunately, she reached out to the family software developer for assistance.
After quite a bit of research into the available practice management systems on the market, Eddie kept coming back to the same conclusion. There has to be a better solution. Why should systems either require such a large cash outlay, limit mobility, or be a stripped down product that’s lacks critical features??? So he committed to create a system for her that would meet the needs of her growing practice.
Several months, meetings and feedback sessions, and countless hours of programming later, eVetPractice.com was a working practice management system. Dr. Arp has been using it since and with a little word of mouth we found others that were interested in giving it a shot as well.
Since then, we have taken enhancement suggestions from our clients and leads to continue to grow and become a truly veterinarian designed system. We are proud to say that we work with some of the best in the business and they are making us what we are today. Each helping to keep us on our toes in the ever changing world of Veterinary Medicine Technology. We strive to honor that contribution by providing a software they enjoy using and industry leading customer service. Our clients now span more than 47 states within the United States, as well as Canada and Australia. We look forward to offering eVetPractice.com to many more practices and adding to our family of raving fan clients!

I started in customer service at age 15 and since have always focused on careers that involve working with people. My family and friends might say I was blessed with the “gift of gab”. I am a proud graduate of Georgia State University in the field of Risk Management and Insurance. However, I have spent most of my post college career in the software industry. I love the idea of structure and rules that comes with software. Okay, so mostly, finding ways to bend it to meet needs not thought of yet…
I am totally devoted to my two beautiful children, our wonderful dog, and the best husband in the world. You may know him as Eddie or “that guys that seems to have all the answers”. I also love to play indoor soccer and pretend to be young again once a week. If you are ever in Atlanta, let me know and I will have you drop by to watch a game and have a good laugh. I am the 4’10’’ red headed feisty one.
eVetPractice.com clients are like extra family members. I strive each day to make the family a great, big, happy one. You may meet me in the sales process, through our support chat, or on a training phone call. No matter how we meet, know that I will try my hardest, along with the rest of the eVetPractice.com team, to make choosing, learning, and using our practice management system an fantastic experience.

I go by “Mel” and yes it is short for Melissa.
My experiences come from 19 years of being a College Soccer Coach. I coached at all levels. My job was to mold young female adults on and off the field. The challenges that came from the job was finding ways to motivate, encourage, teach and problem solve for each student-athlete with different backgrounds. (Not to mention the recruiting, fundraising, community service, Athletic Events, and so much more outside the coaching aspect.) Coaching you have to invest in each person, it is not a 9-5 job.
What I bring to eVetPractice is; hard work, willingness to problem solve, motivate and encourage as you learn the system and endure change, invest in you and your practice and most of all bring energy because I love people and Animals! I was a proud owner of a 13.5 year old pound puppy name Shelby that was a 110 lb Lab mix.

I found myself very lucky at age 14 when life handed me a school-to-work opportunity at an animal hospital. How AWESOME! I LOVE animals AND I get to work with them? Sign me up! I rolled up my sleeves and got to work in the kennels until I made my way up to teching. Once I got there, I knew I had to make my life about helping people AND animals. I found that balance and passion in customer service and sales for a veterinary distributor in 2007 and the next 10 years were written! Meanwhile, I personally adore a techy/nerdy way of life; buying all the latest gadgets, learning and mastering all things technology and passing the knowledge down to others. So much so, I was considering a new path in life in IT. And then there it was, eVetPractice, the perfect combination of animal health and technology!!! It’s a perfect match and I couldn’t be any happier now that I am a part of the eVet family! When I’m not spending time with my eVet family, you can find me with my other family. We love spending our days exploring and traveling while doing photography, hiking, making music, longboarding and cooking. We also think our extremely spoiled puppy, Melee, is the prettiest, best dog in the world.

How it all beganOur history and how we became who we are today.
eVetPractice began back in 2011 when our owner and founder, Eddie Heinz, was tasked by his sister-in-law to find an affordable practice management solution that offered the necessary features to run the new mobile practice she was beginning. Dr. Kristen Arp had worked in corporate medicine for some time and knew the value of properly managing her business, but like most veterinarians, did not have a background in software and was concerned about making the right choice. Fortunately, she reached out to the family software developer for assistance.
After quite a bit of research into the available practice management systems on the market, Eddie kept coming back to the same conclusion. There has to be a better solution. Why should systems either require such a large cash outlay, limit mobility, or be a stripped down product that’s lacks critical features??? So he committed to create a system for her that would meet the needs of her growing practice.
Several months, meetings and feedback sessions, and countless hours of programming later, eVetPractice.com was a working practice management system. Dr. Arp has been using it since and with a little word of mouth we found others that were interested in giving it a shot as well.
Since then, we have taken enhancement suggestions from our clients and leads to continue to grow and become a truly veterinarian designed system. We are proud to say that we work with some of the best in the business and they are making us what we are today. Each helping to keep us on our toes in the ever changing world of Veterinary Medicine Technology. We strive to honor that contribution by providing a software they enjoy using and industry leading customer service. Our clients now span more than 47 states within the United States, as well as Canada and Australia. We look forward to offering eVetPractice.com to many more practices and adding to our family of raving fan clients!

 We made the conversion to eVetPractice in December 2014 after 15 years with Cornerstone.  I have been very pleased with all aspects, including support, of this cloud-based system for both my referral and primary care practices.  The system can be easily customized to fit particular needs and there is a continual additions and improvements to the software based on the feedback from users.
Rick Wall, DVM, DACVSMR, CCRPOwner/Doctor - Animal Clinics of The Woodlands - The Woodlands, TX


 We are a modern, convenient and customer-focused Veterinary practice. eVetPractice allows us to be 100% paperless, creative with our communication and technology focused. We found the missing link we were looking for to increase our production while working with medical records, referral options, and appointment scheduling. The innovative design group, exceptional support staff and client focused team at eVetPractice are among the best in the business .
Audrey J Wystrach DVMOwner/Doctor - ZippiVet Pet Hospitals - Austin, TX


 eVetPractice is the best veterinary software available. If you are looking for a software for your clinic- stop looking and get eVet. Not only is the program itself incredible- online, cloud based, accessible from anywhere and with so many options available but the support is unreal. These guys will literally do everything they can to help every single customer. The software has made my practice so easy to run, saved me tons of money and is so dependable. The customer support is available with a live chat anytime you are having an issue and they bent over backwards for me to help me include French in the program and they would do the same for any clinic. I can’t say enough good things about this software.
Dr. James DrookerOwner/Doctor - Clinique Vétérinaire de Pointe St-Charles - Montréal, QC


 For someone that has been a veterinary hospital owner since 1995 I came to the conclusion that I just had to suffer with less than adequate veterinary practice software until my business partner came across eVetPractice late last year. And boy am I glad he did. I know for all practice owners and office managers changing practice software can be horrifying because we all hate change BUT that’s eVetPractice’s strong suit – ease of changeover because of absolutely OUTSTANDING customer service. Our story is simple, our software was crashing around us because our old vendor had not planned on the next iMac update and we had to switch in 1 week (yes 7 days!) and amazingly eVetPractice made it happen – conversion of old data, online training and the willingness to customize some reports that we simply couldn’t do without.
Am I happy? Hell yes! Do I want to tell my competitors? Hell no! But it is great software, very flexible, intuitive and easily customizable. Our record keeping is better but our doctors do go a little slower, but our medical records are much better which saves us all time in the long run, and since we’ve gone to EMR we haven’t misplaced one file. The integration of lab work into the medical records also makes client communication much easier and better and my doctors love using the software from home to follow cases. I couldn’t be happier and would be pleased to answer any questions a prospective user of this software would have. I’m on the Dean’s Advisory Council at the Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine and I’m recommend they switch to eVetPractice – that’s how much I like it.
John MaddiganOwner/ Manager - Willamette Valley Animal Hospital - Keizer/Salem, Oregon


 With a practice with 2 separate locations – there is always “extra” worry when it comes time for a data conversion. eVet was very attentive to our concerns and made the transition as seamless as possible. Any issues that arose were small ones and were taken care of almost immediately.
As with any new system there is always a learning curve – and Eddie and his team have shown the utmost in patience as we made good use of their live support system. Response time is really remarkable – and suggestions for customization are always meet with a positive and timely response.
The Lab Dashboard has really streamlined our communication with our clients regarding lab work and all communications are easily accessible via the “Communication Log”.
The ability to create our own templates for reminders, emails, documents and reports was really one of the strongest points for our choosing eVet. With a little coaching from the eVet team we are creating custom forms for all aspects of our office – something that we were unable to do with our previous system.
Because we are not a paperless office yet – there are some features of eVet that are not as user friendly as they would be for a completely cloud-based EMR office. But I have no doubt that as we continue to work towards our goal of a paperless environment – eVet and their excellent support staff will be there to make the transition as smooth as possible.
Anne CadretteVeterinary Technician/Office Manager - The Cat Doctor of Bedford and Nashua - Bedford, MA and Nashua, NH


 Evetpractice is by far much superior to any other veterinary software on the market in my opinion! We have used a major brand software for our practice for five years before switching and I can tell you that the team at evet are years ahead of the competition!
Evetpractice is a software for veterinarians that want to move forward with practice efficiency, and electronic medical record keeping. It is so easy to use anyone can use it with just a small amount of training.
I was extremely nervous about making a software change but the transition was very smooth and we really did not have any big issues. The ever present chat box open on the screen allow for immediate help whenever a question is encountered.
If software changes need to be made they are willing to target those and make any suggested reasonable changes to make the software better. I would not hesitate to change software to evetpractice if you want to move forward and take your veterinary practice to the highest level!
Craig Harrell, DVMOwner - Singing River Animal Clinic - Lucedale, MS


 Wonderful customer service–very responsive and helpful when we have a problem or mess things up.
Program is very user friendly, customizable, and intuitive –the iPhone equivalent of the veterinary practice software world.
Lindsey Petras, DVMOwner - Grants Mill Animal Hospital - Irondale, AL


 I want to congratulate the folks at evetpractice for achieving what the competition has not been able to yet; a reliable, efficient, intuitive and powerful software without the hassles of having servers or other major hardware.
Our practice is run fully on laptops and tablets. We couldn’t be happier with our choice especially because of the personalized, quick and friendly support provided by the tech support staff.
Amongst the many difficult decisions I have had to make when opening a new practice, choosing evetpractice was spot on!
David Carmona, DVMOwner - Veterinary Wellness Center of Surfside - Surfside, FL


 Going with eVetPractice has been a great decision for our practice. This is an innovative, reasonably priced software that we would definitely recommend to others.
We have never before dealt with such an amazing customer service staff. They not only guided us through the transition, but are now always ready to answer our questions
They even listen to our suggestions and have made additions and changes to accommodate us where possible. We see this as a long term relationship with a great company!
Lisa CrabillOwner - Haslet Veterinary Clinic - Haslet, TX


 eVetPractice is working quite well for us. We currently have two brick & mortar practices but chose eVetPractice more so because of our other “practices”. We hold mobile vaccination clinics around the state and the web based software is saving us from the constant syncing of equipment that we had to do with our previous software. We have found eVP to be much more attentive to our needs as a unique veterinary practice. Because we have crews working around the state simultaneously, it creates situations for us that perhaps are not experienced by other clinics.
We are definitely happy with eVetPractice and would certainly recommend it to others. The support team has been the best we’ve ever worked with. They have been incredible in their support and attentiveness to our wants and needs. The software is improving constantly and they truly seem to be developing a system that will work well for our field.
I can also say that for those of us that have used multiple veterinary software programs over the years, this one has been the easiest to learn. Even for our newer staff, the learning curve was not nearly what we’ve experienced with other software.
Russell Bush, D.V.M. - Mark A. Vara, D.V.M.Vanguard Veterinary Associates - San Antonio, Texas


 In retrospect, switching to a new Veterinary Management Software and going paperless, and changing some procedures and straightening out all of our messy data in only 6 weeks was a bit insane.
The smart thing we did was to have eVetPractice on site for training and go live. Although eVetPractice could not be more different than IDEXX Cornerstone, it is also very logical.
Our staff was amazing at picking up the new system and eVet’s support was even better. The data transfer was clean, our downtime was only a half day because we wanted to do a full inventory, and within 2-3 days we are all pros at the eVet system. The ease of use is eVets strength. It does not have the massive reporting module that Cornerstone has, but has had the reports that I need.
Also, eVet is faster than Cornerstone even though the servers it runs are 4 states away. No more nightly reboots and end of day processing for us! We are a single three doctor practice. Do not hesitate to give eVetPractice a try if you are considering upgrading Veterinary Management Systems.
Jeff GorrOwner - Wausau Animal Hospital - Wausau, WI


 Our animal hospital transitioned to eVetPractice to take us “paperless” from traditional paper medical records and from Intravet for practice management.
There was a steep learning curve for our staff and doctors to go from paper to paperless along with going from Intravet to eVetPractice for the invoicing and reporting. Fortunately, the staff and owners at eVetPractice have made the process as painless as possible.
Whenever there is large amounts of data converted from one system to another, there will be some hiccups, but fortunately those were very few with our conversion, and all issues were resolved very quickly and efficiently.
Some strengths of eVetPractice include the amazing flexibility of setup for your individual practice, super-responsive customer/technical support, access to records online anywhere, and intuitive medical records. Every time we have asked for a specific functionality, the answer has been affirmative, and a solution has been created for our needs very quickly.
The cost of implementing eVetPractice was quite affordable. Our biggest cost was upgrading our computers, network, and internet access to make sure that we didn’t have any issues getting online to have access to our cloud-based system.
Weaknesses have been few – biggest from my point of view is the lack of “canned” reports that take only 1 or 2 mouse-clicks to generate quickly and conveniently. I would not let that deter anyone from giving eVetPractice a try, because the reporting is very flexible and you can pull out almost any information you are looking for, it just may take a little longer than with some other systems. That reporting functionality is the only reason to not give 5 stars overall.
Overall we have been very pleased with our choice of eVetPractice.
Dan Smith, DVMOwner - Alburtis Animal Hospital - Alburtis, PA


 We converted from a 20 year old Veterinary Practice Management Software called AVS. It had 20 years of reminders, codes, and history. We were concerned about the conversion, but the eVetPractice team made it seamless. All of our data is intact. The interface is extremely intuitive. The customer service is unmatched. When there have been issues, we are constantly amazed at how fast they respond and update things. We took a risk in going with a small cloud based company, but we truly believe that this is the future. I am even more convinced that eVetPractice is the future.
Dr. Tad MoseleyAnimal Health Center - Valdosta, Georgia


 I have been using eVetPractice for 4 months. My favorite feature of the program is its accessibility. Overall, the site is easy to learn how to use.
The customer service that this company provides is unbelievable! It’s refreshing to know a company will still respond to your problems and needs as quickly as the team at eVetPractice does!
However, I do feel that some of the features could be more streamlined. (I’m hoping that tech support will eventually make a few of these bigger changes for me!!) Overall, I am so happy I made the change.
It has made my practice more efficient and shows our clients a more professional image.
Nancy Powel, DVMOwner - Maryland Mobile Veterinary Clinic, LLC - Westminster, MD


 Opening a new animal hospital is a huge undertaking as you must consider every aspect, not only involved with a new business, but a medical practice as well! Eddie Heinz, with eVet Practice, turned the task of choosing what software would be the best choice for our practice, to a no brains decision! The program is very user friendly, but should you run into questions or problems, Eddie is readily available to assist. He also has taken suggestions and requests for additions to the software that have had to enabled us to be more efficient within our practice. Kuddos to Eddie Heinz and eVet Practice! We highly recommend them both!
Dr. Shane Henry/Katy HenryRiver Region Animal Hospital - Crystal River, Florida


 eVetPractice.com was a young company when I began my mobile veterinary practice, and I can say that it has been wonderful to grow with them! Cloud-based software is a great solution for me. I love that it is virtually paperless in so many areas, including records, emailing receipts & Rabies Certificates to owners, having lab results delivered into my patients records, sending referral information via email – again, all beneficial for my mobile practice and MY TIME! And the software has evolved on a daily basis. I have made requests and suggestions – many clients have done the same – and the software is updated and modified continually to enhance the offering and the ease of using the system. You feel that it is being customized just for you, and in many cases, it is! You will never find better customer service than you will experience with eVetPractice.com!!! I love the system and you will, too!
Dr. Susan HaightMy Pet's Mobile Vet - Alpharetta, Georgia


 Will give customer service a 10 star + rating!! We liked this software for our practice initially because it was so complete, versatile and matched our budget. After speaking with them, even before we bought a contract, we asked about some features – and they changed features based on our suggestions! Since then, the company engineers work around the clock (it seems!) to help with our issues – mostly by inventing new items, buttons, windows and features to meet every suggestion or issue we have. The customer service is by far outstanding!! Once we got over a few operating bumps (hardware configurations) and understand the program now, we feel like it is custom designed just for us. We have considerably reduced operating costs in time and paper, exceeding our own expectations. We are only 3 months into it and feel like all is running quite smoothly. We have no regrets and highly recommend Evet to any practice interested in going paperless (or mostly paperless) – and for sure Cloud based, whether mobile or not. We are excited to see this company and the Practice Management software they offer grow! Thank you Eddie and Evet!!
Dr. Teri SueMy Home Vet - Eugene, Oregon


 I have found eVetPractice.com to be an intuitive, personalized, veterinary management software program that eliminates the need to maintain a server, does not require back-up protocol, and updates are performed seamlessly without the need or cost of an information technologist. The speed and flexibility of eVetPractice.com support staff is incredible and far beyond any expectations I had ever had…or could have imagined. They truly do strive to make you a “raving” fan of their practice management software program.
Dr. Douglas A. KernAnimal Surgery & Advocacy Services - Windham, Maine


 Serving the Servants’ with eVetPractice Software (EMR) is the best decision we ever made! Kindred-Canines in Motion Inc. is so grateful for eVetPractice and their Cloud Based Electronic Medical Records (EMR). KIM could not have gotten off the ground without their help! KIM is in now in “Motion” with eVetPractice! KIM now offers reliable, professional EMR anytime and anywhere… It is Priceless! eVetPractice.com has allowed our disabled clients to have access 24/7 for their Assistance/Service Dog records when they need them. Thank You eVetPractice for making Mobile easier!
Dr. Joyce GerardiKindred-Canines in Motion (K.I.M.) - Valrico, Florida


 eVetPractice.com provides me with the mobility and flexibility I need for my mobile practice. Accessing client and patient information on the go, completing patient records anywhere, and even direct links to my Antech lab work for submission and results all mean that I can get the job done efficiently. And the support I get from eVet is second to none! They have been with me every step of the way, from introduction to the software, to rapid response to my questions- they even helped customize the program to suit my specific needs! This software has really been the solution for my practice. It allows me to have more time for my patients and clients!

Rick Wall, DVM, DACVSMR, CCRPOwner/Doctor - Animal Clinics of The Woodlands - The Woodlands, TX


 We are a modern, convenient and customer-focused Veterinary practice. eVetPractice allows us to be 100% paperless, creative with our communication and technology focused. We found the missing link we were looking for to increase our production while working with medical records, referral options, and appointment scheduling. The innovative design group, exceptional support staff and client focused team at eVetPractice are among the best in the business .
Audrey J Wystrach DVMOwner/Doctor - ZippiVet Pet Hospitals - Austin, TX


 eVetPractice is the best veterinary software available. If you are looking for a software for your clinic- stop looking and get eVet. Not only is the program itself incredible- online, cloud based, accessible from anywhere and with so many options available but the support is unreal. These guys will literally do everything they can to help every single customer. The software has made my practice so easy to run, saved me tons of money and is so dependable. The customer support is available with a live chat anytime you are having an issue and they bent over backwards for me to help me include French in the program and they would do the same for any clinic. I can’t say enough good things about this software.
Dr. James DrookerOwner/Doctor - Clinique Vétérinaire de Pointe St-Charles - Montréal, QC


 For someone that has been a veterinary hospital owner since 1995 I came to the conclusion that I just had to suffer with less than adequate veterinary practice software until my business partner came across eVetPractice late last year. And boy am I glad he did. I know for all practice owners and office managers changing practice software can be horrifying because we all hate change BUT that’s eVetPractice’s strong suit – ease of changeover because of absolutely OUTSTANDING customer service. Our story is simple, our software was crashing around us because our old vendor had not planned on the next iMac update and we had to switch in 1 week (yes 7 days!) and amazingly eVetPractice made it happen – conversion of old data, online training and the willingness to customize some reports that we simply couldn’t do without.
Am I happy? Hell yes! Do I want to tell my competitors? Hell no! But it is great software, very flexible, intuitive and easily customizable. Our record keeping is better but our doctors do go a little slower, but our medical records are much better which saves us all time in the long run, and since we’ve gone to EMR we haven’t misplaced one file. The integration of lab work into the medical records also makes client communication much easier and better and my doctors love using the software from home to follow cases. I couldn’t be happier and would be pleased to answer any questions a prospective user of this software would have. I’m on the Dean’s Advisory Council at the Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine and I’m recommend they switch to eVetPractice – that’s how much I like it.
John MaddiganOwner/ Manager - Willamette Valley Animal Hospital - Keizer/Salem, Oregon


 With a practice with 2 separate locations – there is always “extra” worry when it comes time for a data conversion. eVet was very attentive to our concerns and made the transition as seamless as possible. Any issues that arose were small ones and were taken care of almost immediately.
As with any new system there is always a learning curve – and Eddie and his team have shown the utmost in patience as we made good use of their live support system. Response time is really remarkable – and suggestions for customization are always meet with a positive and timely response.
The Lab Dashboard has really streamlined our communication with our clients regarding lab work and all communications are easily accessible via the “Communication Log”.
The ability to create our own templates for reminders, emails, documents and reports was really one of the strongest points for our choosing eVet. With a little coaching from the eVet team we are creating custom forms for all aspects of our office – something that we were unable to do with our previous system.
Because we are not a paperless office yet – there are some features of eVet that are not as user friendly as they would be for a completely cloud-based EMR office. But I have no doubt that as we continue to work towards our goal of a paperless environment – eVet and their excellent support staff will be there to make the transition as smooth as possible.
Anne CadretteVeterinary Technician/Office Manager - The Cat Doctor of Bedford and Nashua - Bedford, MA and Nashua, NH


 Evetpractice is by far much superior to any other veterinary software on the market in my opinion! We have used a major brand software for our practice for five years before switching and I can tell you that the team at evet are years ahead of the competition!
Evetpractice is a software for veterinarians that want to move forward with practice efficiency, and electronic medical record keeping. It is so easy to use anyone can use it with just a small amount of training.
I was extremely nervous about making a software change but the transition was very smooth and we really did not have any big issues. The ever present chat box open on the screen allow for immediate help whenever a question is encountered.
If software changes need to be made they are willing to target those and make any suggested reasonable changes to make the software better. I would not hesitate to change software to evetpractice if you want to move forward and take your veterinary practice to the highest level!
Craig Harrell, DVMOwner - Singing River Animal Clinic - Lucedale, MS


 Wonderful customer service–very responsive and helpful when we have a problem or mess things up.
Program is very user friendly, customizable, and intuitive –the iPhone equivalent of the veterinary practice software world.
Lindsey Petras, DVMOwner - Grants Mill Animal Hospital - Irondale, AL


 I want to congratulate the folks at evetpractice for achieving what the competition has not been able to yet; a reliable, efficient, intuitive and powerful software without the hassles of having servers or other major hardware.
Our practice is run fully on laptops and tablets. We couldn’t be happier with our choice especially because of the personalized, quick and friendly support provided by the tech support staff.
Amongst the many difficult decisions I have had to make when opening a new practice, choosing evetpractice was spot on!
David Carmona, DVMOwner - Veterinary Wellness Center of Surfside - Surfside, FL


 Going with eVetPractice has been a great decision for our practice. This is an innovative, reasonably priced software that we would definitely recommend to others.
We have never before dealt with such an amazing customer service staff. They not only guided us through the transition, but are now always ready to answer our questions
They even listen to our suggestions and have made additions and changes to accommodate us where possible. We see this as a long term relationship with a great company!
Lisa CrabillOwner - Haslet Veterinary Clinic - Haslet, TX


 eVetPractice is working quite well for us. We currently have two brick & mortar practices but chose eVetPractice more so because of our other “practices”. We hold mobile vaccination clinics around the state and the web based software is saving us from the constant syncing of equipment that we had to do with our previous software. We have found eVP to be much more attentive to our needs as a unique veterinary practice. Because we have crews working around the state simultaneously, it creates situations for us that perhaps are not experienced by other clinics.
We are definitely happy with eVetPractice and would certainly recommend it to others. The support team has been the best we’ve ever worked with. They have been incredible in their support and attentiveness to our wants and needs. The software is improving constantly and they truly seem to be developing a system that will work well for our field.
I can also say that for those of us that have used multiple veterinary software programs over the years, this one has been the easiest to learn. Even for our newer staff, the learning curve was not nearly what we’ve experienced with other software.
Russell Bush, D.V.M. - Mark A. Vara, D.V.M.Vanguard Veterinary Associates - San Antonio, Texas


 In retrospect, switching to a new Veterinary Management Software and going paperless, and changing some procedures and straightening out all of our messy data in only 6 weeks was a bit insane.
The smart thing we did was to have eVetPractice on site for training and go live. Although eVetPractice could not be more different than IDEXX Cornerstone, it is also very logical.
Our staff was amazing at picking up the new system and eVet’s support was even better. The data transfer was clean, our downtime was only a half day because we wanted to do a full inventory, and within 2-3 days we are all pros at the eVet system. The ease of use is eVets strength. It does not have the massive reporting module that Cornerstone has, but has had the reports that I need.
Also, eVet is faster than Cornerstone even though the servers it runs are 4 states away. No more nightly reboots and end of day processing for us! We are a single three doctor practice. Do not hesitate to give eVetPractice a try if you are considering upgrading Veterinary Management Systems.
Jeff GorrOwner - Wausau Animal Hospital - Wausau, WI


 Our animal hospital transitioned to eVetPractice to take us “paperless” from traditional paper medical records and from Intravet for practice management.
There was a steep learning curve for our staff and doctors to go from paper to paperless along with going from Intravet to eVetPractice for the invoicing and reporting. Fortunately, the staff and owners at eVetPractice have made the process as painless as possible.
Whenever there is large amounts of data converted from one system to another, there will be some hiccups, but fortunately those were very few with our conversion, and all issues were resolved very quickly and efficiently.
Some strengths of eVetPractice include the amazing flexibility of setup for your individual practice, super-responsive customer/technical support, access to records online anywhere, and intuitive medical records. Every time we have asked for a specific functionality, the answer has been affirmative, and a solution has been created for our needs very quickly.
The cost of implementing eVetPractice was quite affordable. Our biggest cost was upgrading our computers, network, and internet access to make sure that we didn’t have any issues getting online to have access to our cloud-based system.
Weaknesses have been few – biggest from my point of view is the lack of “canned” reports that take only 1 or 2 mouse-clicks to generate quickly and conveniently. I would not let that deter anyone from giving eVetPractice a try, because the reporting is very flexible and you can pull out almost any information you are looking for, it just may take a little longer than with some other systems. That reporting functionality is the only reason to not give 5 stars overall.
Overall we have been very pleased with our choice of eVetPractice.
Dan Smith, DVMOwner - Alburtis Animal Hospital - Alburtis, PA


 We converted from a 20 year old Veterinary Practice Management Software called AVS. It had 20 years of reminders, codes, and history. We were concerned about the conversion, but the eVetPractice team made it seamless. All of our data is intact. The interface is extremely intuitive. The customer service is unmatched. When there have been issues, we are constantly amazed at how fast they respond and update things. We took a risk in going with a small cloud based company, but we truly believe that this is the future. I am even more convinced that eVetPractice is the future.
Dr. Tad MoseleyAnimal Health Center - Valdosta, Georgia


 I have been using eVetPractice for 4 months. My favorite feature of the program is its accessibility. Overall, the site is easy to learn how to use.
The customer service that this company provides is unbelievable! It’s refreshing to know a company will still respond to your problems and needs as quickly as the team at eVetPractice does!
However, I do feel that some of the features could be more streamlined. (I’m hoping that tech support will eventually make a few of these bigger changes for me!!) Overall, I am so happy I made the change.
It has made my practice more efficient and shows our clients a more professional image.
Nancy Powel, DVMOwner - Maryland Mobile Veterinary Clinic, LLC - Westminster, MD


 Opening a new animal hospital is a huge undertaking as you must consider every aspect, not only involved with a new business, but a medical practice as well! Eddie Heinz, with eVet Practice, turned the task of choosing what software would be the best choice for our practice, to a no brains decision! The program is very user friendly, but should you run into questions or problems, Eddie is readily available to assist. He also has taken suggestions and requests for additions to the software that have had to enabled us to be more efficient within our practice. Kuddos to Eddie Heinz and eVet Practice! We highly recommend them both!
Dr. Shane Henry/Katy HenryRiver Region Animal Hospital - Crystal River, Florida


 eVetPractice.com was a young company when I began my mobile veterinary practice, and I can say that it has been wonderful to grow with them! Cloud-based software is a great solution for me. I love that it is virtually paperless in so many areas, including records, emailing receipts & Rabies Certificates to owners, having lab results delivered into my patients records, sending referral information via email – again, all beneficial for my mobile practice and MY TIME! And the software has evolved on a daily basis. I have made requests and suggestions – many clients have done the same – and the software is updated and modified continually to enhance the offering and the ease of using the system. You feel that it is being customized just for you, and in many cases, it is! You will never find better customer service than you will experience with eVetPractice.com!!! I love the system and you will, too!
Dr. Susan HaightMy Pet's Mobile Vet - Alpharetta, Georgia


 Will give customer service a 10 star + rating!! We liked this software for our practice initially because it was so complete, versatile and matched our budget. After speaking with them, even before we bought a contract, we asked about some features – and they changed features based on our suggestions! Since then, the company engineers work around the clock (it seems!) to help with our issues – mostly by inventing new items, buttons, windows and features to meet every suggestion or issue we have. The customer service is by far outstanding!! Once we got over a few operating bumps (hardware configurations) and understand the program now, we feel like it is custom designed just for us. We have considerably reduced operating costs in time and paper, exceeding our own expectations. We are only 3 months into it and feel like all is running quite smoothly. We have no regrets and highly recommend Evet to any practice interested in going paperless (or mostly paperless) – and for sure Cloud based, whether mobile or not. We are excited to see this company and the Practice Management software they offer grow! Thank you Eddie and Evet!!
Dr. Teri SueMy Home Vet - Eugene, Oregon


 I have found eVetPractice.com to be an intuitive, personalized, veterinary management software program that eliminates the need to maintain a server, does not require back-up protocol, and updates are performed seamlessly without the need or cost of an information technologist. The speed and flexibility of eVetPractice.com support staff is incredible and far beyond any expectations I had ever had…or could have imagined. They truly do strive to make you a “raving” fan of their practice management software program.
Dr. Douglas A. KernAnimal Surgery & Advocacy Services - Windham, Maine


 Serving the Servants’ with eVetPractice Software (EMR) is the best decision we ever made! Kindred-Canines in Motion Inc. is so grateful for eVetPractice and their Cloud Based Electronic Medical Records (EMR). KIM could not have gotten off the ground without their help! KIM is in now in “Motion” with eVetPractice! KIM now offers reliable, professional EMR anytime and anywhere… It is Priceless! eVetPractice.com has allowed our disabled clients to have access 24/7 for their Assistance/Service Dog records when they need them. Thank You eVetPractice for making Mobile easier!
Dr. Joyce GerardiKindred-Canines in Motion (K.I.M.) - Valrico, Florida


 eVetPractice.com provides me with the mobility and flexibility I need for my mobile practice. Accessing client and patient information on the go, completing patient records anywhere, and even direct links to my Antech lab work for submission and results all mean that I can get the job done efficiently. And the support I get from eVet is second to none! They have been with me every step of the way, from introduction to the software, to rapid response to my questions- they even helped customize the program to suit my specific needs! This software has really been the solution for my practice. It allows me to have more time for my patients and clients!
