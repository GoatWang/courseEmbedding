What our customers say ...








                                    Xavier and the team at Angel Investment Network were a pleasure to work with, extremely professional and everybody that we were introduced to said the same. They provided us with quality leads and we have a couple on board as first round investors.                                







Chris Michael @ Swytch
 swytch.com                                        








                                    Raising capital is arguably one of the most difficult tasks an entrepreneur faces especially at the Proof of Concept phase. Angel Investment Network worked with my team to ensure that our offering was optimally positioned and as a result we closed $2MM in funding a month later. We are now raising a much larger round as we are no longer proving the concept and we will be using this platform as a key component of our capital raise strategy.                                 







William Nobrega @ Kiseguro
 www.kiseguro.com                                        








                                    I applaud your initiative of creating a system to connect inventors and investors, so that new products and services can be given their chance.  I am very confident about the contact we have received for our Legal Software project, which is unique in its sector. Congratulations!

MEGATRENDS
We see alpha in today’s global megatrends. At PGIM, we help clients see the investable implications of today’s most important economic and societal trends – the megatrends that we believe will reshape the U.S. and the world, driving long-term value. PGIM provides a broader lens through which to view those opportunities, across a broad range of asset classes and countries, to capture real investment alpha. Unprecedented urban expansion and global longevity are two of those trends.
