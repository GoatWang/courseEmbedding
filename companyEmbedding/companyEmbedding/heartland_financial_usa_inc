The Start of Making Great Things Happen!™ Before Heartland Financial, there was Dubuque Bank and Trust, a community bank born of the Great Depression. It served the area independently until 1981, when the economic environment demanded change. The banking industry was struggling with the uncertainties of deregulation, and interest rates hit an all-time high, bringing the economy to its knees. Our hometown of Dubuque, Iowa, received national attention as the city with the highest unemployment rate in the nation, reaching well into double digits as the community’s two largest employers experienced layoffs and real estate values crashed through the floor.  In 1981, DB&T was very closely held, and the question pondered by a number of its directors was “How can we retain the benefits of locally managed community banking while preserving and increasing the value of our shares for future generations?” As history has proven time and again, out of the darkest times come great new visions, and this was certainly the case with Heartland.  The Vision The concept of community banking was near and dear to the hearts of our visionary directors at that time. They were convinced that a community bank model based on local ownership and local decision-making would have value well into the future. Directors William C. Brown, Lynn S. Fuller, Evangeline K. Jansen, James A. Schmid and F.W. Woodward all had banking relationships with large regional banks, as well as with their own community bank, Dubuque Bank and Trust, and had experienced the ease of doing business with a community bank.  To position the company for future expansion, the directors decided that a holding company should be formed, mapping a new course for the company. The creation of Heartland Bankcorp, subsequently renamed Heartland Financial USA, Inc., resulted in a one-bank holding company. Its sole asset was Dubuque Bank and Trust, with $200 million in assets and five offices in Dubuque County. The company was now poised for growth and geographic diversification of risk.  Early Progress In the following 10 years, Heartland acquired its first out-of-state bank in Illinois, Galena State Bank and Trust. With the 1994 acquisition of First Community Bank, F.S.B, Keokuk, Iowa, Heartland shares were registered with the SEC, and for the first time Heartland stock was publicly traded. During the mid-1990s, Heartland continued its Midwest expansion with the formation of Riverside Community Bank in Rockford, Illinois. Additionally, we acquired what is now Wisconsin Bank & Trust in Madison and Monroe, with subsequent expansion into Green Bay and Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  Growing a Legacy Following early acquisitions in the Midwest, Heartland gained the experience and acquired the technology needed to reach more distant markets. Beginning in the late 1990s the company ventured west, actively expanding with both acquisition and de novo activity in New Mexico, Arizona, Montana and Colorado, as well as Minnesota, Kansas and Missouri, all supported by the company’s centralized, state-of-the-art backroom operations in Dubuque.  In recent years Heartland has increased the percent of total assets held in our Western banks, moving closer to our goal of an equal distribution of assets between our Midwestern and Western banks.  Surpassing Expectations In 2003, the listing of Heartland stock on the NASDAQ National Market System brought closure to the question originally pondered by the company’s organizers. Heartland was now traded nationally on a major stock exchange and could provide its shareholders increased liquidity and attractive returns.  Our commitment to an enhanced customer experience was demonstrated in 2010 when we announced a significant addition to our residential mortgage lending capabilities. Our team of mortgage banking professionals and executives is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Mortgage services are offered within our bank footprint as well as in Nevada and Idaho.  Growing Tradition Looking ahead, we see an attractive position for Heartland by virtue of our size, as we strategically operate between the mega banks and small community banks. Banking today is a business of scale. As an organization with a multi-billion of assets, we have the resources to afford highly qualified talent, state-of-the-art technology, continued investment in training, product development and compliance. We are able to offer products and services that are competitive with the largest banks and still deliver the high-touch personalized banking experience our clients appreciate.

Style Scores:



B Value | F Growth | B Momentum | C VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Heartland Financial USA, Inc. and Rockwell Collins, Inc. earn Loras College Business Analytics Innovation Award

For Immediate Release

DUBUQUE, Iowa—The Center for Business Analytics at Loras College recognized Heartland Financial USA, Inc. and Rockwell Collins, Inc. as 2017 Business Analytics Innovation Award recipients for demonstrating excellence through their use of analytics to better serve their company and customers. The awards, sponsored by TH Media, were presented Thursday during the 2017 Loras College Business Analytics Symposium.
Winners were chosen based on a business analytics project, process or concept implemented by the company and the tangible economic, social or environmental impact it demonstrated.
Rockwell Collins is a pioneer in design, production and support for aerospace and defense customers. The global business, headquartered in Cedar Rapids, operates in more than 60 locations in 27 countries, employees 19,000 people, and had more than $5.2 billion in revenues in fiscal 2016.
Rockwell Collins values Lean principles and is always striving for continuous improvement. This team identified opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in manufacturing and inventory management, particularly for obsolete parts.
“It is critically important that business decisions are based on timely and accurate information,” said Chris Arthur, principal business intelligence analyst for Rockwell Collins, who led the winning analytics effort. “When your products are used to fly airplanes, or provide defense to soldiers, accurate information is critical.”
With his big-data solution, Arthur and a global team merged information from four complex business systems with more than 40 million records from four business units and shared services. Now, in seconds, users can see their part usage exposure and projected inventory runout dates for 30 years into the future. Arthur’s solution postures the organization for even more predictable business performance and is yielding expected outcomes.
Founded in 1981, Heartland Financial USA, Inc., headquartered in Dubuque, is a multibillion dollar bank holding company offering uniquely different banking solutions for business and personal clients. Heartland’s independent community banks are chartered in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas and California, with a total of 108 banking locations serving 85 communities.
In 2016, Heartland Financial commissioned a cross-functional project team to enhance commercial sales and coaching by creating consistent data visualization of commercial products and sales goals. This enterprise-wide endeavor engaged business partners in Heartland executive management, commercial lending, treasury management, business analysis, process improvement, information services and business intelligence.
The collaborative approach delivered a solution that standardized commercial lending metrics, freed thousands of hours annually from data management and reporting, and directly and visually linked sales activities to results.

Customer Spotlight: Heartland Financial USA, Inc.


IT Infrastructure Monitoring 



IBM i 




      Posted:     

Jan. 17th, 2017 













 
Charles Bertsch and Paul Duval are part of the operations team at Heartland Financial, a multi-bank holding company based out of Dubuque, Iowa. These guys were excited to share how Robot job scheduling and monitoring software has helped them manage their processing needs across platforms from their iSeries. With a goal of doubling in size every five to seven years, the processing window was a concern. They needed tools that could grow with their business and came up with some creative solutions using Robot.
#1: Centralize Scheduling on the iSeries
Prior to Robot, operations at Heartland Financial involved a lot of manual processes and problems with temperamental built-in task schedulers. Their third shift would run nightly processing until 1:00 a.m., and then run manual jobs afterwards because operators had to physically watch them. They started using native schedulers for some of those jobs, but the challenge there was that their nightly workflow never ended at exactly the same time. Due to the amount of guesswork in timing, managing nightly processes and 400 separate month-end jobs on the IBM scheduler and Windows scheduler was tough.
What really intrigued Heartland with the Robot products was being able to have the iSeries applications control all their jobs, not only on the iSeries but on the Windows scheduler as well, using Robot Schedule and Robot Schedule Enterprise. Following an update to their Fiserv Signature software, they were able to use the Schedule Activity Monitor (SAM) in Robot Schedule to spot the handful of jobs that didn’t run, see what queries they were calling, step through them, and kick off the jobs again, all from a single dashboard. The SAM is the first thing their operators check—they look for the red “X” and attempt to rerun the job.
#2: Establish Fiserv Message Archive for Auditors
The Fiserv Signature application does not provide a canned report confirming that all jobs completed, and that’s really what their auditors expected to see. When Heartland kicks off a nightly process, it runs a batch job stream that spawns several different jobs and messages, which the operators watch to make sure it completes before moving on to the next bank. But try to explain that to an auditor! They’d say, “How do you know they watched it to completion?”
Paul used the global programming in Robot Console to look for specific message IDs from each bank. The messages confirm when backups and batch jobs are complete. Robot catches these messages from Fiserv and emails them to the operations team, who archive them for auditors to prove that any given job or backup finished without digging through job logs. All they need is the message from Robot Alert, which says exactly what auditors need to hear.
#3: Track Disk Space Usage for Cost Allocation
Before Robot, Heartland lacked disk accounting services across their 10 independently chartered banks and 81 banking locations. Changes in library size for their many banks needed to be tracked so they could allocate costs.
Using Robot Space, they’ve been able to monitor library growth and analyze existing trends to make space for new data. They also use the size of their data libraries to do allocations. After jobs run the first of the month, for example, Charles can go back and graph out their status, how big the libraries are each month, how they change and fluctuate. Heartland just concluded a rollout project putting Robot scheduling and monitoring products on all their test partitions to create true simulations of their production environment. They have storage thresholds and notifications in place for the production environment and look forward to pushing out Robot Space to their test partitions to help manage disk space there, as well.
#4: Optimize Existing Staff
When they were smaller, Heartland had more time to deal with the eccentricities of native schedulers. But with recent acquisitions and more planned for the coming years, their growth strategy demanded a scalable solution. Reliable processing was even more mission-critical. If things continued to err out as often as it did before Robot, the only solution would be to have somebody watching the system at all times. As they add banks and processing, their goal is to position themselves to handle the rapid growth and fold in additional banks, while maintaining the same processing window without adding staff.
Automation was huge for them to maintain that window so they would have time to run their extracts on a consistent basis. Without Robot, Heartland would have had to add staff to monitor jobs overnight. Robot jobs run unattended and do what they’re intended to do. When the operations team arrives in the morning and checks the dashboard, the jobs are consistent.
#5: Leverage Robot Tech Support
When they first began using Robot products, Heartland was coming away from manual processes and built-in schedulers on the iSeries and Windows. They had a lot of entries to move over and, on the enterprise side, they had to make sure the services were running on specific servers. Naturally, they were a little apprehensive about making sure the conversion went well.
The migration tool in Robot was helpful, and they did some training for their core group to get them familiar with the products. They also spent a lot of time working with Roxanne Callan, a technical consultant at HelpSystems. Paul tells us she was really helpful and that they pretty much had a direct line to her phone! In comparison to their other software vendors, Charles ranked Robot support services “definitely above average.” Heartland is comfortable calling or using the online chat option to get the answers or assistance they need in setting up anything they’re trying to do.
We asked them to sum up their experience with HelpSystems and the Robot products in ten words or less. They did it in three: Great support. Simple.
