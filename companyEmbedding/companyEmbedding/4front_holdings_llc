4Front Ventures













Leadership through Action
At 4Front Ventures, we're building a medical cannabis industry based on compassion, integrity, and accountability.





                Our Story
            

                Our Values
                











Our Story
4Front Ventures was founded in 2011 by people averse to hype who saw a need for a responsible, measured, and professional approach to the fledgling medical cannabis industry.
Since 2011, we’ve quietly racked up successes while others have sought the limelight. To date, our team has obtained 50 operating licenses for partners in some of the country’s most competitive state-legal markets.
We’ve built upon that foundation of success—and supplemented it with our team’s expertise in the fields of finance, retail, real estate, agriculture, and extraction technology—to evolve 4Front’s business model beyond just consulting.
Today, 4Front Ventures is a platform with a 360-degree view of the industry. It provides an ideal vantage point from which to pursue strategic opportunities in the areas of cannabis cultivation, retail distribution, production, technology, and other ancillary services.

4Front Advisors provides unparalleled support and access to the best practices and people within the rapidly evolving medical cannabis industry.

The team’s diverse capabilities and demonstrated success has gained the company a reputation among its peers for its professionalism, intimate knowledge of diverse regulatory environments, and, most importantly, an ability to secure licenses in highly competitive jurisdictions.
From the beginning, 4Front Advisors has been dedicated to not only helping its partners succeed, but in helping professionalize the medical cannabis industry by offering training and guidance to operators that meets the highest standards for patient safety.

DENVER & PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MJardin Management, LLC (“MJardin”), a Denver, Colorado-based 
      cultivation management company, and 4Front Advisors, LLC (“4Front”), a 
      Phoenix, Arizona-based consulting firm, today announced the formation of 
      a strategic relationship to assist in bringing MJardin’s turnkey 
      cultivation management services to licensed marijuana producers in newly 
      regulated states. As part of the arrangement, 4Front will introduce 
      MJardin’s industry leading cultivation solutions to its vast network of 
      clients and industry contacts.
    


      MJardin and 4Front will also work closely with MJAR Holdings, LLC 
      (“MJAR”), a Florida-based company dedicated to acquiring, developing and 
      licensing industry-leading intellectual property related to premium 
      cannabis production, to accelerate the growth and adoption of MJAR’s IP 
      portfolio. MJAR’s portfolio consists of proprietary processes, 
      technologies, designs, formulas, systems, software, genetics, nutrient 
      formulations and other materials associated with the large-scale 
      production of premium marijuana.
    

      Adam Denmark Cohen, MJAR’s CEO and a co-founder of MJardin, commented, 
      “We are excited to collaborate with the 4Front team, whose dedication to 
      professionalizing the regulated marijuana industry is demonstrated by 
      its unique capabilities, network and track record of helping clients 
      secure licenses in newly regulated states like Arizona, Massachusetts, 
      Nevada and Illinois and working closely with license holders to 
      implement and apply best industry practices in new operations. We share 
      4Front’s vision of bringing best-in-class operating practices to these 
      new markets and look forward to helping move the industry forward 
      together.”
    

      “Starting new cultivation facilities from scratch is an arduous task for 
      new operators and we have struggled to find competent, affordable 
      cultivation solutions for our clients since our formation in 2011,” 
      noted Kris Krane, co-founder and managing partner of 4Front. “Having 
      validated MJardin’s performance and having worked with the team through 
      a common client, we are confident that combining our expertise will 
      allow us to raise the bar on supporting the development of cultivation 
      operations in new markets. We’re optimistic that closer alignment will 
      make both organizations stronger in a regulated industry that largely 
      remains in its infancy, particularly when it comes to large-scale 
      cultivation facilities.”

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
