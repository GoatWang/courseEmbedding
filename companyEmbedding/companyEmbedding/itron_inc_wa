History [2][edit]
Itron was founded by a small group of engineers trying to find more efficient ways to read meters in Hauser Lake, Idaho, in 1977. In 1984, Itron experienced global expansion into the Asian market and developed new manufacturing plants in France and the U.K. By 2006, Itron consulting teams were created to offer services for energy efficiency programs, renewables, conservation and demand response. Itron gained national recognition from the White House in 2010, for its commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and contributions to a clean energy economy. Within the same year, Itron and Cisco formed an alliance to deliver Internet Protocol (IP) communications to the smart grid market thus changing networking capabilities for utilities. Itron is a founding member of the Smart Cities Council, having joined in 2013. Itron is also a partner of Microsoft CityNext helping with global Smart City initiatives. After developing Itron OpenWay Riva adaptive communications technology (ACT), Itron launched the Itron Riva Developers Community for the Internet of Things, for developers interested in developing software applications for the IoT space.[3]

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

But the electricity, gas and water meters and modules in Itron's OpenWay Riva IoT solution are more than just smart meters, sensors or communications modules. OpenWay Riva embeds the equivalent computing power of a smart phone or desktop computer in every device, enabling real-time analysis of high-resolution data at the edge of the network.This eliminates latency and avoids any loss of data resolution during transfer over the network. OpenWay Riva also provides a robust distributed computing platform architected using open standards to run “apps” on meters and other edge devices, thereby unleashing a growing ecosystem of new providers to innovate on the platform—metering simply becomes one of the apps that these devices run.OpenWay Riva’s distributed computing platform also enables an increasingly diverse ecosystem of grid devices, sensors and assets—ranging from smart meters to IoT sensors, all able to utilize peer-to-peer communications to share data and collaborate in real time to solve problems at the edge of the network as conditions change. That means a smart meter or grid sensor can talk directly to a distribution automation controller, to an inverter on a solar panel or to a remote valve control on a gas or water pipeline. This type of self-directed device interaction has always been central to the vision of a smart distribution grid but never possible—until now.

Resourcefulness: An Introduction to the Energy-Water Nexus is mobile device compatible



With rapid changes in technologies and an aging workforce, we are facing a significant skills gap in STEM related fields of study (science, technology, engineering and math). As a business leader and STEM employer, Itron is partnering with Dr. Michael Webber, renowned author and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, to invest in the next generation of innovators to help solve the world’s greatest challenges. 
Our Resourcefulness: An Introduction to the Energy-Water Nexus is being created in line with College and Career Readiness/Common Core Standards including Next Generation Science Standards, Advanced Placement (AP) Environmental Science, and International Baccalaureate Environmental Systems and Societies. The material is designed to complement and enhance existing curriculum and lesson plans with fully developed teaching resources.
Over the coming months, Resourcefulness will evolve from a more traditional in-class educational program for secondary education into a curriculum that can be shared across many channels. Modular units on sustainability and effective resource management will encourage the conversation around resourcefulness on many different age and educational levels, including primary education and adult education for professional development. Shorter week-long and day-long programs will also be available.
Sign up to stay informed about this STEM curriculum and all of Itron’s educational activities. 












2016 Resourcefulness Index


                Itron is pleased to release this edition of its annual Itron Resourcefulness Index. This report offers a unique perspective on the state of the utility industry and global resourcefulness. It is one of the first to examine both executive and consumer attitudes within the utility industry, surveying more than 900 informed consumers and 900 utility executives in 16 countries in every region of the world.

Internet of Things














Moving from Smart to Active


Efficient, modernized infrastructure. Reliable, safer systems. Smarter, connected cities and consumers. Less waste. Collecting more data from a smart grid won’t address challenges like these. We need to create a distribution network that adapts and reacts to changing conditions in real time—one with the intelligence to do what it can, when it needs to, and to know when it needs help from the back office. We need to move from smart to active.
                


                            Read More
                            









    All of these opportunities—making our energy and water infrastructure more efficient, more reliable and less wasteful, and making our cities more vibrant, economically viable and sustainable—are within reach once the right technology is applied, in the right places, to approach problems in new ways in the Internet of Things (IoT) age.


At Itron, we call this the Active Grid. It’s much more than smart metering and it’s even more than the smart grid. It encompasses electricity, gas, water and smart cities—and opens up an entirely new frontier for better management of energy and water resources. The Active Grid is a new level of situational awareness that leverages machine to machine communications and learning within the system—whether that’s the electrical grid or gas and water distribution networks. The Active Grid results in better business outcomes for energy and water providers.


There are four key aspects that define the Active Grid:


Distributed intelligence, which optimizes data analysis, decisions and control—from devices in the field all the way to back office, enabling real-time problem solving.
Assured connectivity and network reliability through multiple, adaptive communication technologies like radio frequency (RF), power line carrier (PLC), WiFi and cellular.
An open application ecosystem that enables the development of innovative, new distribution system applications—from a variety of sources and secured to the highest standards.
A unified, interoperable and multi-purpose network to empower new smart utility and smart city uses and applications.


These technologies come together in Itron’s OpenWay Riva™, an IoT solution for smart utilities and cities. OpenWay Riva enables true interoperability and distributed intelligence, delivering business outcomes for utilities and smart cities like never before—and helping to create a more resourceful world.
