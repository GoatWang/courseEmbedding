The First Edition Library (F.E.L.) published by The Easton Press, this is a complete, matching, 14 volume set of every “James Bond” book. These are exact first edition facsimiles of each Ian Fleming “James Bond” story and all are housed in a decorative slipcase. This is a rare out-of-print collection.
Aside from the original first editions, which are exceedingly expensive and extremely hard to acquire, The First Edition Library 14 volume set is the second most collectible complete set. Each book is an exact replica of the original first edition, with faithful matching of size, typography, and dust jacket artwork.
Fleming’s suspenseful series of 14 novels about the British fictional spy James Bond, known by his code 007, begins with Casino Royale in 1953 and ends, upon Fleming’s death, with Octopussy in 1964. Fleming’s work for the British Naval Intelligence provided the background for his spy novels.
Includes: Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, Diamonds are Forever, From Russia With Love, Dr. No, Goldfinger, For Your Eyes Only, Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, You Only Live Twice, The Man With The Golden Gun, and Octopussy.
