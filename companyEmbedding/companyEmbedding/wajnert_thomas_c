Thomas C. Wajnert

Tom Wajnert is a leasing pioneer, having launched his career in 1968 with US Leasing, a NYSE-listed company that is widely regarded as the progenitor of the modern equipment leasing industry. For over 40 years, Tom has navigated the changing currents of the equipment leasing industry and built an impressive list of accomplishments.
He joined AT&T in 1984, founding AT&T Credit Corporation, a captive finance organization, which quickly expanded and evolved to become AT&T Capital Corporation, an international, full-service equipment leasing and commercial finance company. Under Tom’s leadership, AT&T Capital grew quickly, became publicly owned, was bought out by management, and subsequently sold in 1997.
After his success with AT&T Capital, Tom’s career took an entrepreneurial turn as he invested in and created an HR outsourcing firm, EPIX, and later a technology-based business, SEISMIQ. In 2001, he co-founded FairView Advisors LLC, a middle-market merchant bank. From 2006 to the present, Tom has provided advisory services to several private equity firms. A former chairman of the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA), Tom also served as the chairman of the Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation. He is now chairman of the board of RAI (NYSE), serves on the board and is chairman of the Audit Committee at UDR (NYSE) and serves as a trustee of Wharton’s Center for Financial Institutions.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.
