Best Company with a financial size category of X ($500 million to $750 million) and rank 77 on the list of Top 200 U.S. Property Casualty Writers in the 2016 Best’s Review. In addition, UFG was named one of “America’s 50 Most Trustworthy Financial Companies” by Forbes for the third consecutive year in 2016 and a Super Regional Property/Casualty Insurer™ by Insurance Journal every year since 2006, as well as a “Top Workplace” by The Des Moines Register for the third time in 2016.UFG also earned the prestigious "Five-Star Carrier" rating from Insurance Business America in 2016 for our excellence in financial stability, company reputation, claims processing, underwriting expertise and product offerings. At UFG, we’re proud of the recognition we’ve received in the insurance industry, establishing ourselves as the clear company of choice for our agents, policyholders and employees. These awards reflect our ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional protection and services and demonstrating outstanding integrity and transparency in all we do. 


Founded in 1946The story of UFG begins with the vision of Scott McIntyre Sr., a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, businessman. McIntyre had the ambition to form a stock insurance company in Iowa—an ambition he achieved on January 2, 1946, with the opening of United Casualty Company, as we were originally known.From there, our story becomes one of small insurance companies merging and working together; of outgrowing old spaces and moving to new ones; of expanding into different territories and acquiring more business; and—through it all—doing business the right way and treating people the right way. Because that’s the way we do things at UFG.Read noteworthy moments in our 70-year history. 1946UFG, originally known as United Casualty Company, opens on January 2, 1946, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, writing automobile and liability lines of insurance in Iowa.1950Insurance laws change to allow companies in Iowa to begin selling multiple lines of insurance.

Insurance protection for businesses and individuals
When deciding on insurance protection, what matters? Do you compare the coverages and premiums? Do you review the services and financial ratings?


At UFG, we understand how important the insurance decision is, especially considering all that our customers have entrusted us with: their businesses built from the ground up; their homes filled with valued possessions; their cars that get them from here to there; and their lives for the people who depend on them.No matter how careful we are, life is full of unavoidable twists and unexpected turns. In the insurance industry, that translates into storms, thefts, accidents and fires. These events can have a devastating impact on their own and, even more so, without the proper insurance.  

















Put your trust in UFGUFG provides protection you can trust in, with a complete line of insurance products for businesses and individuals, available through our exclusive group of independent insurance agents across the country.




What matters to you, matters to usWe work in close partnership with our local insurance agents—who know you and know your needs—to ensure that our customers have the necessary insurance protection to repair, rebuild and recover after a loss.With UFG, the insurance decision is made simple, because what matters to our customers—exceptional products, affordable pricing, quality services and outstanding financial strength—matters to us too.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

A.M. Best Affirms Ratings Of United Fire Group, Inc. And Its Subsidiaries






Business Wire




Apr 30, 2014 10:15 AM EDT













 




























































  A.M. Best has affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and issuer credit ratings (ICR) of “a” of the property/casualty subsidiaries of United Fire Group, Inc. (UFG) [NASDAQ: UFCS] (collectively known as United Fire & Casualty Group), which operate under an inter-company pooling agreement led by United Fire & Casualty Company. Concurrently, A.M. Best has affirmed the ICR of “bbb” of UFG.  At the same time, A.M. Best has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and ICR of “a-” of United Life Insurance Company (United Life), a wholly owned subsidiary of UFG. The outlook for all ratings is stable. All companies are headquartered in Cedar Rapids, IA. (See below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.)  The ratings of United Fire & Casualty Group reflect its solid risk-adjusted capitalization, diversified commercial product offerings, historically favorable core reserve levels and the financial flexibility afforded by UFG. United Fire& Casualty Group’s ratings also reflect the continued advantages of its long-standing agency relationships and solid regional franchise, which was enhanced by the acquisition of Mercer Insurance Group, Inc. (Mercer) and its property/casualty insurance subsidiaries in March 2011. In addition, underwriting results improved substantially in 2013 as a result of rate revisions, less catastrophic and large loss activity and continued favorable prior year loss reserve development.  These positive rating factors are partially offset by the variability in United Fire & Casualty Group’s underwriting and operating results in recent years, driven by adverse loss reserve development from Hurricane Katrina-related claims (in 2008 and 2009), catastrophe and weather-related losses (in 2011) and the continued challenging, albeit improving, market conditions in the group’s core markets.  The ICR of UFG recognizes the capital strength of its subsidiaries and the fact that it has no outstanding debt.  While A.M. Best believes UFG and United Fire& Casualty Group’s ratings are well positioned at their current rating levels, factors that may lead to negative rating actions include a trend of deteriorating underwriting and operating performance to a level below its peers and/or an erosion of surplus that causes a decline in risk-adjusted capital to a level that no longer supports the current ratings.

    Our Corporate Responsibility
    



The Light Shines ThroughOur
Corporate Responsibility Report tells our story of how the promises we keep in the business world parallel those we pledge to our community, employees and environment. We align our corporate values to our corporate responsibility because it’s the right thing to do for people, and the smart thing to do for business. Along with a strong belief in corporate responsibility, we also encourage our employees to participate in volunteer and service activities and provide paid time off hours to allow them to do so. Because so many of our employees and agents go above and beyond each year in their volunteer efforts, we created the Go Beyond Award. You can read about our most recent winners in the Corporate Responsibility Report. To learn more about the award and the nomination process, visit www.gobeyond.insure.
