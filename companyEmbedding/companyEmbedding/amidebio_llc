ABOUTYou are here: Home
AmideBio is a preclinical stage biotech company pursuing a series of therapeutic targets and diagnostic in the diabetes space. These include ultrastable insulin, glucose sensing insulin, solution stable glucagon and improved diagnostics for juvenile (T1) diabetes. In the diabetes space, a library of single chain insulin (SCI) analogs have been manufactured using a proprietary design protocol optimized for the production of SCI analogs that are resistant to thermal and chemical degradation at elevated temperature while maintaining maximal bioactivity. These novel insulins can address a number of stability issues that limit the growth of existing insulin as a therapy for worldwide markets, including breaking the cold chain, oral delivery, and improvements in insulin pump operation, patches, and increased concentrations above U1000. Similarly, the company has designed and manufactured a library of solution stable glucagon analogues suitable for use in a pump for either an artificial pancreas or for the treatment of the rare disease congenital hyperinsulinism. The company has also recently begun a discovery program for novel forms of glucose sensing insulins that will eliminate the need for both basal and prandial insulins allowing single weekly dosing. In addition the company manufactures the worlds highest purity amyloids for the Alzheimer’s research community and is leveraging its proprietary BioPure™ platform technology to deliver other difficult-to-manufacture peptides including proinsulin, toxins, bowman-birk inhibitors and more.

ManufacturingYou are here: Home / ManufacturingAmideBio can provide innovative biotech service manufacturing for peptides and proteins using a novel recombinant-chemical hybrid process. From bench scale mg to multi-gram scale, AmideBio can meet your needs by producing higher quality peptides and proteins at lower cost. AmideBio’s patent pending hybrid recombinant-chemical system is scalable and ideally suited for the manufacturing of difficult to produce hydrophobic, toxic, and amyloidogenic peptides no matter what the polypeptide length.
AmideBio has constructed a proprietary set of expression vectors that achieve high yields of target peptides and protein fusions. The expressed target is easily isolated as inclusion bodies from lysed cells. The target peptide/protein fusions are bound to an affinity column where refolding of the target is also possible followed by low cost proprietary chemical cleavage releasing a highly pure target product.

AmideBio Obtains Core Patent for Peptide Production Platform Technology

 AmideBio Obtains Core Patent for Peptide Production Platform Technology 

BOULDER, CO, August 20, 2014 – AmideBio, LLC, a privately held biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued United States Patent 8,796,431, “Efficient Production of Peptides”. The patent provides broad coverage of the Company’s core platform technology: its efficient and green BiopureTMpeptide manufacturing process. The Biopure process facilitates rapid structure activity relationship (rSAR) studies on high value peptide therapeutics and lowers the downstream production costs for difficult to manufacture peptides. The company has already leveraged this platform technology in several high value areas, including the production and initial evaluation of a large library of thermostable Insulins, several next generation diabetes product candidates, and the production of highly pure amyloid peptides for research in Alzheimer’s Disease.
“Issuance of this U.S. patent represents a key milestone for AmideBio. We expect that it will be the first of many patent issuances covering aspects of our core Biopure platform technology as well as classes of peptides that we are developing for the research and commercial markets,”  said Dr. Misha Plam, AmideBio’s President and CEO. “Our initial research focus has been on novel Thermostable Insulins and other peptides for the treatment of diabetes and on amyloid peptides for the study of Alzheimer’s. The breadth of our platform will allow us to pursue these and other peptides having both medical and commercial significance, and we are actively pursuing potential partnership and license arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.”
The technology was developed under the scientific leadership of Dr. Michael Stowell, Associate Professor of MCD Biology and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado, and the Company’s CTO and founder. The University has exclusively licensed its rights in the technology to AmideBio. “We are delighted to see the issued patent on Dr. Stowell’s invention,” said Kate Tallman, Interim Associate Vice President of Technology Transfer at CU. “AmideBio has put enormous effort into perfecting the process and developing the strategic relationships necessary to take it to market.”                                                                                                                                                                   
About AmideBio:
AmideBio, based in Boulder, CO, is a biotechnology company leveraging its proprietary BioPure™ platform technology to deliver difficult-to-manufacture peptides and build a pipeline of novel biotherapeutics. AmideBio's proprietary technology enables the rapid and economical manufacture of pure peptides of any length. This innovative technology combines recombinant and chemical methods, eliminates many of the inefficient and costly steps of processes that rely only on one or the other approach, results in fewer batch inconsistencies and less waste generation. Such advantages enable AmideBio to offer its cost-efficient technology and peptide product candidates to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. The Company continues to expand its proprietary technology platform in the areas of protein production, biosimilar therapeutic manufacturing and internal research and development of novel biotherapeutics aimed at metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Ultrapure Amyloids, Proinsulins, Toxins, Peptides | AMIDEBIO












































 
0Shopping Cart 






ABOUTYou are here: Home
AmideBio is a preclinical stage biotech company pursuing a series of therapeutic targets and diagnostic in the diabetes space. These include ultrastable insulin, glucose sensing insulin, solution stable glucagon and improved diagnostics for juvenile (T1) diabetes. In the diabetes space, a library of single chain insulin (SCI) analogs have been manufactured using a proprietary design protocol optimized for the production of SCI analogs that are resistant to thermal and chemical degradation at elevated temperature while maintaining maximal bioactivity. These novel insulins can address a number of stability issues that limit the growth of existing insulin as a therapy for worldwide markets, including breaking the cold chain, oral delivery, and improvements in insulin pump operation, patches, and increased concentrations above U1000. Similarly, the company has designed and manufactured a library of solution stable glucagon analogues suitable for use in a pump for either an artificial pancreas or for the treatment of the rare disease congenital hyperinsulinism. The company has also recently begun a discovery program for novel forms of glucose sensing insulins that will eliminate the need for both basal and prandial insulins allowing single weekly dosing. In addition the company manufactures the worlds highest purity amyloids for the Alzheimer’s research community and is leveraging its proprietary BioPure™ platform technology to deliver other difficult-to-manufacture peptides including proinsulin, toxins, bowman-birk inhibitors and more.
