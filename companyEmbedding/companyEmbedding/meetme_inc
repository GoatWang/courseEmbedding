What happened
Shares of dating social network MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET) soared as much as 16% on Monday after the company swung to a profit for its third quarter. The stock is up about 5.1% at the time of this writing.
So what
MeetMe's third-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $17.2 million and $0.10, respectively, were about exactly in line with the consensus estimate from analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. The company's EPS by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standards was notably solid, too. MeetMe reported GAAP EPS of $0.07, up from a loss of $0.04 in the same period last year.
Revenue from mobile, which increased 39%, was a key driver for the company's 20% year-over-year increase in overall revenue.
Management was particularly optimistic about increasing engagement on the platform, noting comments and likes on topical posts increased by 70%. Furthermore, MeetMe CEO Geoff Cook said its Skout and MeetMe social networks now boast over 8 million monthly active users combined, with "one of the largest mobile user bases of millennials."





Now what
Going forward, the company said it plans to launch an "exciting new mobile video product" during the first quarter of 2017.
Investors should continue to watch the trajectory of engagement, as measured by comments and likes and the company's monthly active user count. In addition, they should keep an eye out for this new mobile video product.

MeetMe® Enhances Mobile Subscription Product MeetMe+Company extends mobile monetization leadership among mobile social appsNEW HOPE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MeetMe, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MEET), the public market leader for social discovery, today announced that it is adding new features to its mobile premium subscription product, MeetMe+. The new release of MeetMe+ adds two new member benefits, as well as two additional "freemium" products that are now available for purchase with MeetMe Credits.Originally introduced in March 2013, MeetMe+ allows subscribers to see which users have viewed their photos and the photos they viewed, provides for suppression of ads within mobile applications, and gives subscribers bonus virtual currency as well as discounts on virtual currency purchases.With the enhancements announced today, premium subscribers will also have the option to browse profiles and pictures in stealth mode and discover which users have been asking them anonymous questions by "unmasking" the questions. These features are available as part of a MeetMe+ subscription, as well as through use of the Credits virtual currency by all MeetMe subscribers."We are committed to further expanding our mobile monetization," noted Geoff Cook, Chief Executive Officer. "In the month after the launch of MeetMe+, mobile bookings increased by 81% versus a year ago and 24% versus the Q1 average. We also climbed 32 places from the 83rd top-grossing app on Android to number 51 among all apps, and we climbed 27 places on iPhone from the 127th top-grossing app to number 100 among all apps. Today's announcement strengthens the MeetMe+ product significantly by proving two of the most requested features to subscribers. We expect to release additional upgrades to the MeetMe+ service later this year."The pricing for MeetMe+ varies by platform and duration. On Android, the pricing is one year of MeetMe+ at $6.67/month (one payment of $79.99) or one month for $9.99/month. On iOS, the pricing is six months at $6.67/month (one payment of $39.99), three months at $8.33/month (one payment of $24.99), or one month at $9.99.MeetMe is currently the #1 top-grossing social application in the US Google Play Store, and top 10 among all social applications in the iOS US App Store.About MeetMe, Inc.MeetMe® is the leading social network for meeting new people in the US and the public market leader for social discovery (NYSE MKT: MEET). MeetMe makes meeting new people fun through social games and apps, monetized by both advertising and virtual currency. With 60% of traffic coming from mobile, MeetMe is fast becoming the social gathering place for the mobile generation. The company operates MeetMe.com and MeetMe apps on iPhone, iPad, and Android in multiple languages including English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Chinese (traditional), Russian and Japanese.Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained herein, including statements that additional upgrades to the MeetMe+ service are expected later this year, are forward-looking statements. The words "believe," "may," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "should," "plan," "could," "target," "potential," "is likely," "will," "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include: the risk that our additional upgrades to the MeetMe+ service later this year, will not launch as and when expected. Further information on our risk factors is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2013. Any forward-looking statement made by us herein speaks only as of the date on which it is made.

Why MeetMe Inc. Stock Popped Today
The social media specialist jumped after a strong quarterly report and a new acquisition.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Mar 7, 2017 at 12:54PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET) were up 14% as of 11:45 a.m. EST Tuesday after the social media technology company announced an acquisition and better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2016 results.
So what
Quarterly revenue climbed 47% year over year, to $29.2 million, including 62% growth in mobile revenue, to $27.8 million. As fellow Fool Rick Munarriz previously noted would be the case, this growth was driven primarily by MeetMe's $55 million cash-and-stock acquisition of Skout last October. On the bottom line, that translated to 56% growth in adjusted net income, to $12.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.
Analysts, on average, were only expecting adjusted net income of $0.16 per share on lower revenue of $28.8 million.

IMAGE SOURCE: MEETME.

"We made tremendous progress on multiple fronts in 2016," added MeetMe CEO Geoff Cook. "We achieved record financial results for the year, reflecting the increasing value of our audience to mobile advertisers, as well as our growth in mobile engagement through product innovation and the acquisition of Skout."
In addition, MeetMe announced that it has executed a $60 million cash agreement to acquire If(we), Inc., another social and mobile technology company that owns the Tagged and hi5 brands. If(we) generated $44 million in revenue last year, including 56% growth in mobile revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone.





Now what
MeetMe's latest acquisition will boost its global mobile monthly active user base to 10.6 million people, is expected to add at least $9 million to adjusted EBITDA this year, and should be accretive to earnings and free cash flow within the first 12 months after the transaction's expected close sometime in the second quarter of this year.
All things considered, this was a great quarter from MeetMe, and it's hard to argue with the rationale behind this complementary acquisition. With shares still down nearly 30% from their 52-week-high since peaking last August, it's no surprise to see investors aggressively bidding up MeetMe stock today.
