NEW APPROACHES, NEW HOPE





Established in 2011, OncoSec Medical Incorporated is a San Diego-based biotechnology company pioneering new technologies to stimulate the body’s immune system to target and attack cancer. Through our proprietary technology, we hope to deliver safer and more effective cancer treatments that can provide long-term benefits for patients.





OncoSec’s investigational platform, ImmunoPulse®, is designed to enhance local delivery and uptake of DNA-based therapeutics directly into tumors. Clinical studies of ImmunoPulse® with DNA-based IL-12 demonstrated a local immune response, and subsequently, a systemic effect. We are currently conducting pre-clinical and clinical studies targeting various cancers in collaboration with several prominent academic medical centers and companies.





To date, study results have laid the groundwork for OncoSec’s expansion into new DNA-encoded therapeutic candidates and tumor indications. Data also indicates this platform shows clinical activity as a monotherapy and promise as a combination approach.
 










From the CEO





OncoSec’s mission is to take the fight directly to the tumor and harness the power of the body’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer. Our intratumoral immunotherapies continue to show promising preliminary efficacy and safety data from our clinical trials. These results allow us to explore the broad applications of our ImmunoPulse® technology and pursue combination therapies that address a great unmet medical need in oncology: anti-PD-1 non-responders. The scientific community is beginning to realize the potential of intratumoral immunotherapies that directly combat the immunosuppressive mechanisms deployed by tumors.











We are witnessing the emergence of a new vision in the immunotherapy landscape – one that can capitalize on the ability of local therapy to drive a systemic  anti-tumor immune response and overcome some of the limitations of traditional treatments. At OncoSec, we think about cancer treatment differently. We are advancing a new generation of targeted cancer therapies that we hope will result in clinically meaningful benefits to patients who have limited or no available treatment options. We will continue to focus on our responsibilities and make an investment in this future while recognizing the interdependence between our stakeholders: patients, physicians, healthcare workers, shareholders and fellow employees who depend on – and are an integral part of – OncoSec’s continued success.
