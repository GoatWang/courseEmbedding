					Full Description



Gulf Resources, Inc., incorporated on February 28, 1989, is a holding company. The Company manufactures and trades bromine and crude salt; manufactures and sells chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration, oil and gas distribution, oil field drilling, wastewater processing, papermaking chemical agents and inorganic chemicals, and manufactures and sells materials for human and animal antibiotics. The Company operates in three segments: bromine, crude salt and chemical products.BromineThe Company manufactures and distributes bromine through its wholly owned subsidiary, Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited (SCHC). Elemental bromine is used to manufacture various bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture. Bromine is also used to form intermediates in organic synthesis. Its bromine is used in brominated flame retardants, fumigants, water purification compounds, dyes, medicines and disinfectants. Its production sites are located in the Shandong Province in northeastern China. Its production feeds include natural brine, vitriol, chlorine, sulfur and coal.Crude SaltThe Company produces crude salt, which is produced from the evaporation of the wastewater after its bromine production process. Once the brine is returned to the surface and the bromine is removed, the remaining brine is pumped to on-site containing pools and then exposed to natural sunshine. This causes the water to evaporate from the brine, resulting in salt being left over afterwards. Crude salt is the principal material in alkali production, as well as chlorine alkali production and is used in the chemical, food and beverage, and other industries.Chemical ProductsThe Company produces chemical products, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry Company Limited (SYCI) and Shouguang City Rongyuan Chemical Co, Ltd (PRC), or SCRC. The products it produces include Hydroxyl guar gum, Demulsified agent, Corrosion inhibitor for acidizing, Bactericide, Iron ion stabilizer, Flocculants agent, Bromopropane, Solid lubricant, Polyether lubricant and Chlorantraniliprole. Its applications include oil exploration and production, paper making and agricultural. Its major products are Semi-finished Product of Tetramethylbenzidine, Semi-finished Product of Trimethylolpropane and Material of Lactic acid Trimethylolpropane, among others.The Company competes with Shandong Yuyuan Group Company Limited, Shandong Haihua Group Company Limited, Shandong Dadi Salt Chemical Group Company Limited, Shandong Haiwang Chemical Company Limited, Shandong Weifang Longwei Industrial Company Limited, Shandong Caiyangzi Saltworks, Beijing Tianqing Chemical Company Limited, Shandong Weifang Shuangxing Pesticides Company Limited, Shandong Dacheng Pesticides Company Limited, Binhua Group Company Limited, Dongying City Dongchen (Group) Chemical Industry Company Limited, Beijing Peikangjiaye Technologies Limited, Shouguang Fukang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Bromine Products








 

 


Bromine is a nonmetallic chemical element classified under halogen elements. It is highly toxic and extremely reactive, requiring proper precautions when handled. At room temperature, bromine is a thick, reddish brown liquid. The substance is found naturally in bromides, or compounds of bromine, which are ex­tracted from salt lakes, seawater and underground brine wells. Elemental bromine is produced by extract­ing the bromine ion from natural brine. 
 

We use chlorine for the extraction process and sulfur or soda to absorb the elemental bromine. This production method is simple, with bromine extraction rates reaching 70-80%. The process can also be completed in a closed system, imposing minimal strain on the environment. 
 
Elemental bromine is mainly used to manufacture flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, paper, dyes, insect repellents, drilling fluids, perfumes, photographic chemicals, water-treatment chemicals, and sanitizers. Bromine is also a key component of other chemicals. 
 
Crude salt is basic material in the chemical industry. It is the principal material in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the manufacturing and national defense industries.
