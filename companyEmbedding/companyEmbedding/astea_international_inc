Address Your Service Objectives While Meeting Growth and Budget Demands
The service landscape is shifting. It is no longer enough to just satisfy customers; instead we must learn ways to continuously delight our customers. World-class service companies know that an integrated approach that ties call centers, depots, field service, sales and office personnel together provides the most value to their customers. With Astea’s portfolio of solutions we can provide the comprehensive service lifecycle management information backbone that you need to survive in this competitive and dynamic environment.
Whether you have 50 technicians or thousands of technicians, we have the optimal solution to meet your requirements. Astea makes it easier for companies to leverage and adopt industry-proven, best-practice processes and workflows based on more than 34 years of experience.
Large Enterprises
Powerful solutions designed to meet the aggressive and dynamic needs of your business
It can be challenging for a large enterprise to quickly adapt to dynamic business environments and shifting business needs while maintaining a high level of service. We offer customizable solutions that enable you to accelerate revenue growth, gain proactive insight to customer interactions, improve customer satisfaction and experience, and lower total cost of ownership.
Small to Medium Enterprises
Right-sized, feature-rich solutions that enable you to optimize your service business
Over the years, we realized that small business users often required a simpler alternative to the broader more comprehensive service management software, but still required a feature-rich solution. We created a solution to offer that alternative – a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly field service solution for small to medium sized businesses. We are helping small and midsize companies streamline and automate business processes, improve compliance with service level agreements, and synchronize customer touch points for increased customer satisfaction.

Astea Unveils the Latest Release of its Industry Leading Mobile Workforce Solution - Astea International Inc   Medical Device DirectoryAstea International IncNewsAstea Unveils the Latest Release of its Industry Leading Mobile Workforce SolutionAstea Unveils the Latest Release of its Industry Leading Mobile Workforce SolutionPress Release from Astea International IncHORSHAM, Pa., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Astea International Inc., a global leader in service lifecycle management and mobility solutions, introduces the release of Astea Alliance™ Mobile Edge™. Designed based upon feedback from some of the world's leading service-driven companies and nearly four decades of industry experience, this new mobile application of Astea's full life cycle field service management platform Alliance, utilizes the latest in mobile development technology and design principles to help companies increase user adoption, boost technician productivity, improve service margins and contract profitability, and deliver a superior user experience.Alliance Mobile Edge simplifies the complexity of today's service experience by combining deep functionality, robust customer and asset life cycle information, and powerful new emerging technology with highly-configurable interfaces, workflow rules and reporting. The result is a platform designed to enhance technician effectiveness and efficiency in every possible way, including the ability to create a digital work environment that suits each technician's affinity for technology and speed of learning."With Alliance Mobile Edge, we've consciously addressed the challenge that service-driven companies face today. To effectively compete, they require a mobile workforce application that is increasingly complex, capable and connected, and this can quickly overwhelm technicians who already have their hands full dealing with more diverse service offerings and highly demanding customers," said David F. Giannetto, chief operating officer for Astea International. "We've created the most capable mobile application in the industry without sacrificing functionality, by accommodating multiple ways of working, and differing technician abilities and affinity for technology out of the box. Quicker user adoption and higher satisfaction directly equate to higher profitability and improved ROI."Astea Alliance Mobile Edge sets a new standard in mobile workforce management, offering industry leading features and benefits, including:A Sleek, Intuitive User Interface Inspired by the Latest Google Material Design Principles Technicians will execute their workflow, interact with information and launch productivity-enhancing applications through a sleek new user interface (UI) inspired by Google's Material Design principles. The familiarity of this design aids in easy adoption and allows users to intuitively understand how to interact with the application, minimizing the number of screen touches for greater efficiency. Alliance Mobile Edge leverages the latest mobile technology infrastructure, making it more powerful than ever before, with faster rendering, automatic landscape and portrait orientation changes, embedded legends, intelligent help screens and numerous other features designed to enhance user satisfaction.Unprecedented Configuration Capabilities Alliance Mobile Edge puts the power to customize the work environment in the hands of business users. Built upon the long history of Astea Alliance as the most customizable platform in the service management industry, non-technical users can now mirror the most efficient and effective way of working through robust configuration settings. Administrators, managers or supervisors can configure the application to accommodate the needs of each individual worker: modifying the look and feel of specific screens or the entire application; changing labels to reflect local preferences; adding, removing, re-arranging, or changing the settings for any field; modifying workflows, checklists or enabling and disabling entire modules; and much more through a new non-technical interface. This customizer allows organizations to balance universal settings and workflows with local requirements by function, region, business unit, customer group or skill set. New users can start in "simple mode" utilizing only basic functions before experience and training allows them to move into "slim" or "full mode" where additional capabilities are available. This gives workers a natural progression that eases them into the application, all while working in a way that accommodates an organization's need for standardization and consistency.Easy-to-Use Productivity Tools for Faster Learning and Greater Adoption  Every aspect of Alliance Mobile Edge was designed to allow technicians to focus on their job—not on the technology that supports it. Technician-enhancing tools, including team and crew collaboration, "Google-like" knowledge base search results, augmented reality and Artificial Intelligence, are all literally at their fingertips. These features are designed to help engineers diagnose problems, make repairs, perform preventative maintenance and resolve customer issues quickly, even if they have never before worked with a piece of equipment. Additional powerful features include gamification, taking and enhancing photographs, and adding attachments, videos or audio recordings that can then become future knowledge assets available across the entire Alliance platform. Alliance Mobile Edge is powerful enough to help overcome the challenges of an aging workforce, the ever growing number of increasingly complex new assets in the field, and new worker inexperience. Smart, Effortless Technology that Works Everywhere on Everything Alliance Mobile Edge works everywhere. On-line or off-line, the application manages data storage and synchronization so that the technician does not have to be concerned with connectivity, including the availability of supporting documentation and knowledge assets. Uninterrupted service to customers is so important that Alliance Mobile Edge also includes patent-pending capability that quickly restores all data in the event of a device failure. Capable of working on nearly any smart mobile device or computer, organizations can choose the device—or mixture of devices—that works best for them, while still leveraging the most powerful mobile workforce application on the market.Keep Technicians Engaged and Connected While Keeping the Back Office Updated It takes more than just a technician to provide world-class service. Alliance Mobile Edge is seamlessly integrated into every aspect of the Alliance platform. Data from every part of the full field service life cycle flows into Mobile Edge ensuring technicians have all the information they need to deliver an outstanding service experience. The technicians' work is sent back to the office in real time—data is always accurate, complete and up-to-date. This allows not only anyone in the service lifecycle to take action, but also allows the Alliance platform to monitor and manage activities, automatically alerting any key stakeholder inside or outside of the organization when something is happening, did happen, or more importantly should happen. Full GPS tracking (with the ability to modify or disable due to privacy concerns), system wide messaging, and full Microsoft Outlook® calendar integration keep everyone informed. These capabilities extend to both third party technicians and contingent workers through the streamlined version of Mobile Edge designed for augmented workforces.To request a live demonstration of Alliance Mobile Edge, click here.About Astea InternationalAstea International is a global provider of software solutions that offer all the cornerstones of service lifecycle management, including customer management, service management, asset management, forward and reverse logistics management and mobile workforce management and optimization.

	Astea Reports Full Year 2016 and Fourth Quarter Results




	Second Consecutive Year of Double Digit Total Revenue Increase for 2016




	HORSHAM, Pa., March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Astea International Inc. (OTCQB: ATEA), a global provider of service management and mobile workforce solutions, today released its fourth quarter and year-end financial results for fiscal 2016.


	"We are very pleased to announce an increase in total revenues for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The increase in the number of new customers acquired last year, from every part of the world, was a great accomplishment for us. The steadily increasing trend in SaaS revenues is encouraging, and we expect to see it continue. We also experienced an uptick in sales and services activity from our existing customer base, which reflects the increasing benefits they
	are realizing from Astea's enterprise solutions. Amongst our largest customers we are seeing an increased desire to deploy our solutions to new countries and regions as quickly as possible, and given the global nature of these organizations this will fuel our growth for several years to come," stated Zack Bergreen, CEO of Astea International.


	Mr. Bergreen added, "We are in an era in which the levels of digital connectivity and industrial automation are exploding, and its pervasiveness is accelerating and heightening expectations for extraordinary service. Organizations that view service as a strategic component of their business now have a strong sense of urgency to create innovative offerings that leverage this connectivity to deliver exceptional customer experiences. As a result, we see more forward-thinking enterprises turning to Astea as their partner and
	platform of choice, and a critical component of their overall service strategy. This thinking is also reflected amongst our current client base who have long looked to Astea as their service technology partner to make this innovation a reality, to help them outpace their competition, and to enable their operations to deliver service that is a true differentiator. We fully expect that an increasing percentage of the market will realize that the comprehensiveness of our offering is not only unique, but a necessary ingredient for them to compete—balancing the ability to service increasingly complex and demanding customers with their own need to operate more effectively and efficiently. Astea's ongoing commitment to innovation, full life-cycle service management, and laser-focused sales and marketing will propel our on-going success."


	For the quarter ended December
	31, 2016, Astea reported revenues of $9.1 million compared to revenues of $5.3 million for the same period in 2015. Net income to shareholders for the quarter was $2.0 million or $0.52 per share, compared to net loss to shareholders of ($2.1 million) or ($0.59) per share for the same period in 2015. For the 2016 fiscal year, the Company reported revenues of $25.8 million compared to revenues of $23.0 million for 2015. The net loss available to shareholders was ($0.9) million or ($.03) per share in 2016, compared to a net loss to shareholders ($4.4 million) or ($1.32) per share for the same period in 2015.


	Rick Etskovitz, CFO of Astea International stated, "Total revenues increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015. We are proud that we achieved double-digit revenue growth for two consecutive years. We expect to maintain this positive trend into 2017. As noted in the
	financial tables below, Adjusted EBITDA was ($0.8) for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to breakeven for the same quarter last year. For the year end December 31, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA was ($2.0) million compared to $1.3 million in 2015."



	Outlook


	Mr. Bergreen concluded, "As companies aggressively implement strategies to drive service revenues, reduce costs and optimize the customer experience, they need a solution that mirrors the way they think and adapt to these dynamic environments. We remain committed to providing innovative capabilities that give companies greater control and flexibility to modify and extend the Astea Alliance platform into the critical areas of their business both today and into the future. Looking ahead for 2017, we will be introducing a vast number of innovations that will further catapult our technology far past any of our competitors. Our solution suite remains a compelling platform for large, complex and often multi-national organizations that have diverse, complex requirements for achieving their service and corporate objectives. We are inspired by our recent performance and energized
	by our unique place in the market and the opportunities it will provide for us moving forward."

	Statements in this press release, other than statements of historical information, are forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks which may cause the Company's actual results in future periods to differ materially from expected results. Those risks include, among others, risks associated with increased competition, customer decisions, the successful completion of continuing development of new products, the successful negotiations, execution and implementation of anticipated new software contracts, the successful addition of personnel in technical areas, our ability to complete development and sell and license our products at prices which result in sufficient revenues to realize profits and other business factors beyond the
	Company's control. These and other risks are described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including but not limited to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.



	Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results


	In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains Non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes the Non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors' understanding and assessment of the Company's on-going core operations and prospects for the future. Management also uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating business internally and as such deemed it important to provide all this information to investors. The Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to
	those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Reconciliations between GAAP measures and Non-GAAP measures are provided later in this press release.
