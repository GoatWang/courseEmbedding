The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

                    Riding along US#1 in Grant-Valkaria boarding the Indian River  you'll spot a small Island with several homes on it in the middle of the Indian River Lagoon.   It's a wonderful occupied island with  privately owned homes ranging from Fish Camp style up to Multi-million dollar properties and the owners are just as colorful too.  Amazingly enough there's power to the Island that comes from the mainland under ground to the Island and access is  by privately owned boats., no ferry boats or bridges.  Below is information I got off the internet: VIPIsland.com   VIP Island, also known as Grant Farm Island, is a privately owned island in the Indian River Lagoon. The island is about 5 miles north of the Sebastian Inlet, directly east of the town of Grant on Florida's Central East Coast. Two style of residences occupy the island. The south end is made up of acre lots, and large estates. The north end contains approximately 65 homes, all direct waterfront. There are no parks on the island, and all docks are privately owned.

The lifestyle on the island is magical! With no roads, or cars, travelling is either by foot or bike with the occasional golf cart. Flora and fauna abound, with many residents growing fruit trees! Wildlife on land is limited by the location but they do have a pair of beautiful peacocks that roam the island. The aquatic wildlife is another story! The Indian River lagoon is famous for it's varying wildlife. Sit from the dock and watch dolphins play, or the occasional manatee. It is also renowned for it's fishing. Fish from your lawn!
