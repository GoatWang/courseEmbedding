                    HiTape® Reinforcements
        
        

HiTape® innovative high performance dry unidirectional reinforcements are designed to meet the requirements of Aircraft Primary Structures made by cost-effective Out of Autoclave (OOA) technologies such as vacuum infusion or injection.HiTape® allows dry preforms to be manufactured in a fully automated lay-up, similar to the AFP and ATL processes widely used for UD prepregs. The tight width tolerance of HiTape® gives total control of the automated dry preform process – and it is a waste-free operation, even for complex structures, as the materials are placed exactly where required.Using OOA vacuum infusion technology, Aircraft structures made with HiTape® demonstrate fiber volume content and mechanical properties that are very similar to parts made with the latest generation primary structure prepregs. HiTape® gives particularly high Compression After Impact (CAI) performance, which is a real breakthrough in infusion technologies with unidirectional carbon reinforcements.Based on HexTow® carbon fibers, Hexcel supplies HiTape® with HexFlow® infusion epoxy resins for optimum mechanical performances and infusion/injection processing.Click to read article published in SAMPE magazine 2015Customer evaluations have demonstrated that significant cost-savings are achievable with HiTape® and the associated vacuum infusion process. The materials allow the part design to be optimized, including function integration. The automated dry preform process is simplified, without any splicing of materials or polythene film to remove. There is no need to apply pressure to consolidate the preform and remove air as this occurs later when vacuum is applied. Very high preform lay-up outputs are achieved and another cost-saving benefit is that no refrigerator storage is required due to the dry nature of the reinforcements.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

History[edit]
1946 to 1970[edit]
Hexcel was founded in 1946 in San Francisco Bay by engineers Roger C. Steele and Roscoe T. “Bud” Hughes.[10] In 1948, chemist Ken Holland and economist Paul Ammen joined Hughes and Steele, and the company was incorporated in California, U.S. In 1955, the company's name changed to Hexcel Products, Inc. (the name derived from the hexagonal cell-shaped honeycomb materials that the company manufactured).[11]
Hexcel produced cellular structures made from galvanized fiberglass, as well as aluminum and other materials.[12] These were lighter in weight and stronger than steel, and became widely used in the aircraft industry.[13] Hexcel products also started being used in military and commercial aviation, as well as in the United States space program.[14] In 1968, Hexcel purchased Coast Manufacturing (including its manufacturing plants in California, Texas, and Ohio). In 1969, Harvie M. Merrill became CEO.[15]




Honeycomb composite material






Fabric roll


1970 to 1990[edit]
In 1971, the company manufactured and retailed skis made of composite materials. In 1974, Hexcel began supplying complex contoured parts (speed brakes on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle). The same year, Ciba Composites sold Fibrelam® panels (the first non-metallic aircraft flooring materials) to Boeing for the Boeing 747 aircraft.[16]
In 1975, Hexcel acquired a company that specialized in graphite weaving technology and in 1977, it purchased Tower Scientific (a manufacturer of replacement knee, hip, and shoulder joints).[17] In 1980, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1981 the company sold its line of medical products. Hexcel also purchased French glass fiber and woven industrial materials manufacturer Stevens-Genin S.A and Seal Sands Chemical Co. Ltd. (an English specialty chemicals manufacturer).[18] In 1983, the company was re-incorporated in Delaware. Hexcel Composites began to be used in major projects including the space shuttle Columbia and the Voyager aircraft.[19]
In 1986, Chairman of the Board and CEO Merrill retired as CEO and was succeeded by President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Witt.[20] In 1987, the company started plans to build a new $25 million plant in Chandler, Arizona to facilitate its participation in building the U.S. military's Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (for which Hexcel provided "low observable" ["LO"] materials).[21] Company co-founder Roscoe “Bud” Thomas Hughes Jr. died in 1986. In the same year, Hexcel inaugurated the Kenneth M. Holland Research Center in Dublin, California. The company began developing its own resin systems and its own domestic supply of carbon fibers precursor in Decatur (Alabama). Hexcel’s Ciba-Geigy purchased Heath Tecna in 1988.[22]
1990 to 2000[edit]
In 1990, Hexcel started working with Japanese company Dai Nippon Printing and Chemicals. The firms began manufacturing Nomex honeycomb, advanced composites and decorative laminates for the Japanese market.[23] Also in 1990, the company started developing a resilient thermoplastic honeycomb called Hexalite.[24] Hexcel materials started being used in high-speed trains, fishing rods, golf clubs, baseball bats, bicycle frames, and other goods. The company also manufactured chemicals that were used as ingredients in Alka-Seltzer tablets, Scope (mouthwash), and Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup.[25]
In 1993, CEO Bob Witt resigned and was replaced by company directors John Lee and John Doyle. In 1994, Hexcel sold its Teesside, England fine chemicals business, as well as European resins businesses. In 1995, the company sold its U.S. resins operations. Also in 1995, Hexcel acquired Ciba Composites from Ciba-Geigy Limited. The business included prepregs, honeycomb, structures, film adhesives, panels and interiors. In 1996, the firm acquired the Composites Products Division of Hercules Incorporated. Included in the acquisition were Hercules facilities in Magna, Utah, Decatur, Alabama, and Madrid (Spain).[26]
In 1996, Hexcel moved its corporate headquarters from California to Stamford, Connecticut.[27] In 1997, Hexcel acquired Fiberite’s satellite prepreg product line. In 1998, Hexcel formed a partnership with Sika Finanz AG, a construction chemicals and structural adhesives company. The partnership resulted in the development and production of composite systems for the construction industry. Also in 1998, Hexcel acquired Clark-Schwebel.[28]
In 1999, Hexcel formed BHA Aero Composite parts with Boeing and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (formally known as China Aviation Industry Corporation).[29] Also in 1999, Hexcel formed Asian Composites Manufacturing with Boeing, Sime Darby Sdn. Bhd., and Naluri Berhad (formally Malaysian Helicopter Services) to manufacture composite parts for commercial aviation.[30]




Carbon fiber


2000 to Present[edit]
In 2001, David Berges was appointed Hexcel’s Chairman, President and CEO. In 2002, Hexcel inaugurated BHA Aero Composites Parts Co. Ltd (China) and Asian Composites Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia).[31] In October 2003, Hexcel opened a new production unit in Les Avenières (France) that focused on carbon fiber weaving and multiaxials.[32]
In 2004, Hexcel closed its Livermore (California) manufacturing facility and transferred its operations to its Salt Lake City facility. In 2005, the company supplied HexPly® M21 and 8552 prepregs, RTM 6 resins, Injectex® fabrics, Redux® adhesives, HexWeb® honeycombs and machined and heat-formed honeycomb parts to the Airbus A380 program.[33][34]
In 2007, Hexcel opened a prepreg plant in Stade (Germany). The same year, the company won the JEC aerospace innovation award for Acousti-Cap® noise-reducing honeycomb for aircraft engines.[35] In 2009, Hexcel began production of prepregs and other composite materials predominantly for the American wind energy industry. In 2013, Nick L. Stanage was named Hexcel’s President and Chief Executive Officer and joined the company’s Board of Directors.[36]
In 2014, company co-founder Roger C. Steele died at age 93. In September 2014, Hexcel started production of a new precursor and carbon fiber lines in Roussillon (France). In 2016, the company acquired Formax UK Limited, a manufacturer of composite reinforcements located in Leicester, U.K. In January 2016, Hexcel announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in Casablanca, Morocco.[37]
In May 2016, Hexcel opened an Innovation Center in Duxford (U.K.).[38] It also formed a partnership with Oxford Performance Materials (OPM), a company that produces thermoplastic, carbon fiber reinforced 3D printed parts for Commercial aviation and Space and Defense applications.[39] In December 2016, Hexcel Corporation formed a partnership with Carbon Conversions Incorporated (CCI), a company that specializes in carbon fiber recycling and repurposing.[40]

Products[edit]
Hexcel products are manufactured for the Commercial aviation, Space and Defense, and Industrial industries.[41] The company’s Composite Materials segment comprises carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, resins, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, and honeycomb core product lines. The Engineered Products segment comprises lightweight high-strength composite structures, molded components, engineered core and honeycomb products.[42][43][44]

History[edit]
1946 to 1970[edit]
Hexcel was founded in 1946 in San Francisco Bay by engineers Roger C. Steele and Roscoe T. “Bud” Hughes.[10] In 1948, chemist Ken Holland and economist Paul Ammen joined Hughes and Steele, and the company was incorporated in California, U.S. In 1955, the company's name changed to Hexcel Products, Inc. (the name derived from the hexagonal cell-shaped honeycomb materials that the company manufactured).[11]
Hexcel produced cellular structures made from galvanized fiberglass, as well as aluminum and other materials.[12] These were lighter in weight and stronger than steel, and became widely used in the aircraft industry.[13] Hexcel products also started being used in military and commercial aviation, as well as in the United States space program.[14] In 1968, Hexcel purchased Coast Manufacturing (including its manufacturing plants in California, Texas, and Ohio). In 1969, Harvie M. Merrill became CEO.[15]




Honeycomb composite material






Fabric roll


1970 to 1990[edit]
In 1971, the company manufactured and retailed skis made of composite materials. In 1974, Hexcel began supplying complex contoured parts (speed brakes on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle). The same year, Ciba Composites sold Fibrelam® panels (the first non-metallic aircraft flooring materials) to Boeing for the Boeing 747 aircraft.[16]
In 1975, Hexcel acquired a company that specialized in graphite weaving technology and in 1977, it purchased Tower Scientific (a manufacturer of replacement knee, hip, and shoulder joints).[17] In 1980, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1981 the company sold its line of medical products. Hexcel also purchased French glass fiber and woven industrial materials manufacturer Stevens-Genin S.A and Seal Sands Chemical Co. Ltd. (an English specialty chemicals manufacturer).[18] In 1983, the company was re-incorporated in Delaware. Hexcel Composites began to be used in major projects including the space shuttle Columbia and the Voyager aircraft.[19]
In 1986, Chairman of the Board and CEO Merrill retired as CEO and was succeeded by President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Witt.[20] In 1987, the company started plans to build a new $25 million plant in Chandler, Arizona to facilitate its participation in building the U.S. military's Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (for which Hexcel provided "low observable" ["LO"] materials).[21] Company co-founder Roscoe “Bud” Thomas Hughes Jr. died in 1986. In the same year, Hexcel inaugurated the Kenneth M. Holland Research Center in Dublin, California. The company began developing its own resin systems and its own domestic supply of carbon fibers precursor in Decatur (Alabama). Hexcel’s Ciba-Geigy purchased Heath Tecna in 1988.[22]
1990 to 2000[edit]
In 1990, Hexcel started working with Japanese company Dai Nippon Printing and Chemicals. The firms began manufacturing Nomex honeycomb, advanced composites and decorative laminates for the Japanese market.[23] Also in 1990, the company started developing a resilient thermoplastic honeycomb called Hexalite.[24] Hexcel materials started being used in high-speed trains, fishing rods, golf clubs, baseball bats, bicycle frames, and other goods. The company also manufactured chemicals that were used as ingredients in Alka-Seltzer tablets, Scope (mouthwash), and Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup.[25]
In 1993, CEO Bob Witt resigned and was replaced by company directors John Lee and John Doyle. In 1994, Hexcel sold its Teesside, England fine chemicals business, as well as European resins businesses. In 1995, the company sold its U.S. resins operations. Also in 1995, Hexcel acquired Ciba Composites from Ciba-Geigy Limited. The business included prepregs, honeycomb, structures, film adhesives, panels and interiors. In 1996, the firm acquired the Composites Products Division of Hercules Incorporated. Included in the acquisition were Hercules facilities in Magna, Utah, Decatur, Alabama, and Madrid (Spain).[26]
In 1996, Hexcel moved its corporate headquarters from California to Stamford, Connecticut.[27] In 1997, Hexcel acquired Fiberite’s satellite prepreg product line. In 1998, Hexcel formed a partnership with Sika Finanz AG, a construction chemicals and structural adhesives company. The partnership resulted in the development and production of composite systems for the construction industry. Also in 1998, Hexcel acquired Clark-Schwebel.[28]
In 1999, Hexcel formed BHA Aero Composite parts with Boeing and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (formally known as China Aviation Industry Corporation).[29] Also in 1999, Hexcel formed Asian Composites Manufacturing with Boeing, Sime Darby Sdn. Bhd., and Naluri Berhad (formally Malaysian Helicopter Services) to manufacture composite parts for commercial aviation.[30]

(Malaysia).[31] In October 2003, Hexcel opened a new production unit in Les Avenières (France) that focused on carbon fiber weaving and multiaxials.[32]
In 2004, Hexcel closed its Livermore (California) manufacturing facility and transferred its operations to its Salt Lake City facility. In 2005, the company supplied HexPly® M21 and 8552 prepregs, RTM 6 resins, Injectex® fabrics, Redux® adhesives, HexWeb® honeycombs and machined and heat-formed honeycomb parts to the Airbus A380 program.[33][34]
In 2007, Hexcel opened a prepreg plant in Stade (Germany). The same year, the company won the JEC aerospace innovation award for Acousti-Cap® noise-reducing honeycomb for aircraft engines.[35] In 2009, Hexcel began production of prepregs and other composite materials predominantly for the American wind energy industry. In 2013, Nick L. Stanage was named Hexcel’s President and Chief Executive Officer and joined the company’s Board of Directors.[36]

History[edit]
1946 to 1970[edit]
Hexcel was founded in 1946 in San Francisco Bay by engineers Roger C. Steele and Roscoe T. “Bud” Hughes.[10] In 1948, chemist Ken Holland and economist Paul Ammen joined Hughes and Steele, and the company was incorporated in California, U.S. In 1955, the company's name changed to Hexcel Products, Inc. (the name derived from the hexagonal cell-shaped honeycomb materials that the company manufactured).[11]
Hexcel produced cellular structures made from galvanized fiberglass, as well as aluminum and other materials.[12] These were lighter in weight and stronger than steel, and became widely used in the aircraft industry.[13] Hexcel products also started being used in military and commercial aviation, as well as in the United States space program.[14] In 1968, Hexcel purchased Coast Manufacturing (including its manufacturing plants in California, Texas, and Ohio). In 1969, Harvie M. Merrill became CEO.[15]

1970 to 1990[edit]
In 1971, the company manufactured and retailed skis made of composite materials. In 1974, Hexcel began supplying complex contoured parts (speed brakes on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle). The same year, Ciba Composites sold Fibrelam® panels (the first non-metallic aircraft flooring materials) to Boeing for the Boeing 747 aircraft.[16]
In 1975, Hexcel acquired a company that specialized in graphite weaving technology and in 1977, it purchased Tower Scientific (a manufacturer of replacement knee, hip, and shoulder joints).[17] In 1980, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1981 the company sold its line of medical products. Hexcel also purchased French glass fiber and woven industrial materials manufacturer Stevens-Genin S.A and Seal Sands Chemical Co. Ltd. (an English specialty chemicals manufacturer).[18] In 1983, the company was re-incorporated in Delaware. Hexcel Composites began to be used in major projects including the space shuttle Columbia and the Voyager aircraft.[19]
In 1986, Chairman of the Board and CEO Merrill retired as CEO and was succeeded by President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Witt.[20] In 1987, the company started plans to build a new $25 million plant in Chandler, Arizona to facilitate its participation in building the U.S. military's Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (for which Hexcel provided "low observable" ["LO"] materials).[21] Company co-founder Roscoe “Bud” Thomas Hughes Jr. died in 1986. In the same year, Hexcel inaugurated the Kenneth M. Holland Research Center in Dublin, California. The company began developing its own resin systems and its own domestic supply of carbon fibers precursor in Decatur (Alabama). Hexcel’s Ciba-Geigy purchased Heath Tecna in 1988.[22]
1990 to 2000[edit]
In 1990, Hexcel started working with Japanese company Dai Nippon Printing and Chemicals. The firms began manufacturing Nomex honeycomb, advanced composites and decorative laminates for the Japanese market.[23] Also in 1990, the company started developing a resilient thermoplastic honeycomb called Hexalite.[24] Hexcel materials started being used in high-speed trains, fishing rods, golf clubs, baseball bats, bicycle frames, and other goods. The company also manufactured chemicals that were used as ingredients in Alka-Seltzer tablets, Scope (mouthwash), and Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup.[25]
In 1993, CEO Bob Witt resigned and was replaced by company directors John Lee and John Doyle. In 1994, Hexcel sold its Teesside, England fine chemicals business, as well as European resins businesses. In 1995, the company sold its U.S. resins operations. Also in 1995, Hexcel acquired Ciba Composites from Ciba-Geigy Limited. The business included prepregs, honeycomb, structures, film adhesives, panels and interiors. In 1996, the firm acquired the Composites Products Division of Hercules Incorporated. Included in the acquisition were Hercules facilities in Magna, Utah, Decatur, Alabama, and Madrid (Spain).[26]
In 1996, Hexcel moved its corporate headquarters from California to Stamford, Connecticut.[27] In 1997, Hexcel acquired Fiberite’s satellite prepreg product line. In 1998, Hexcel formed a partnership with Sika Finanz AG, a construction chemicals and structural adhesives company. The partnership resulted in the development and production of composite systems for the construction industry. Also in 1998, Hexcel acquired Clark-Schwebel.[28]
In 1999, Hexcel formed BHA Aero Composite parts with Boeing and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (formally known as China Aviation Industry Corporation).[29] Also in 1999, Hexcel formed Asian Composites Manufacturing with Boeing, Sime Darby Sdn. Bhd., and Naluri Berhad (formally Malaysian Helicopter Services) to manufacture composite parts for commercial aviation.[30]




Carbon fiber


2000 to Present[edit]
In 2001, David Berges was appointed Hexcel’s Chairman, President and CEO. In 2002, Hexcel inaugurated BHA Aero Composites Parts Co. Ltd (China) and Asian Composites Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia).[31] In October 2003, Hexcel opened a new production unit in Les Avenières (France) that focused on carbon fiber weaving and multiaxials.[32]
In 2004, Hexcel closed its Livermore (California) manufacturing facility and transferred its operations to its Salt Lake City facility. In 2005, the company supplied HexPly® M21 and 8552 prepregs, RTM 6 resins, Injectex® fabrics, Redux® adhesives, HexWeb® honeycombs and machined and heat-formed honeycomb parts to the Airbus A380 program.[33][34]
In 2007, Hexcel opened a prepreg plant in Stade (Germany). The same year, the company won the JEC aerospace innovation award for Acousti-Cap® noise-reducing honeycomb for aircraft engines.[35] In 2009, Hexcel began production of prepregs and other composite materials predominantly for the American wind energy industry. In 2013, Nick L. Stanage was named Hexcel’s President and Chief Executive Officer and joined the company’s Board of Directors.[36]
In 2014, company co-founder Roger C. Steele died at age 93. In September 2014, Hexcel started production of a new precursor and carbon fiber lines in Roussillon (France). In 2016, the company acquired Formax UK Limited, a manufacturer of composite reinforcements located in Leicester, U.K. In January 2016, Hexcel announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in Casablanca, Morocco.[37]
In May 2016, Hexcel opened an Innovation Center in Duxford (U.K.).[38] It also formed a partnership with Oxford Performance Materials (OPM), a company that produces thermoplastic, carbon fiber reinforced 3D printed parts for Commercial aviation and Space and Defense applications.[39] In December 2016, Hexcel Corporation formed a partnership with Carbon Conversions Incorporated (CCI), a company that specializes in carbon fiber recycling and repurposing.[40]

History[edit]
1946 to 1970[edit]
Hexcel was founded in 1946 in San Francisco Bay by engineers Roger C. Steele and Roscoe T. “Bud” Hughes.[10] In 1948, chemist Ken Holland and economist Paul Ammen joined Hughes and Steele, and the company was incorporated in California, U.S. In 1955, the company's name changed to Hexcel Products, Inc. (the name derived from the hexagonal cell-shaped honeycomb materials that the company manufactured).[11]
Hexcel produced cellular structures made from galvanized fiberglass, as well as aluminum and other materials.[12] These were lighter in weight and stronger than steel, and became widely used in the aircraft industry.[13] Hexcel products also started being used in military and commercial aviation, as well as in the United States space program.[14] In 1968, Hexcel purchased Coast Manufacturing (including its manufacturing plants in California, Texas, and Ohio). In 1969, Harvie M. Merrill became CEO.[15]




Honeycomb composite material






Fabric roll


1970 to 1990[edit]
In 1971, the company manufactured and retailed skis made of composite materials. In 1974, Hexcel began supplying complex contoured parts (speed brakes on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle). The same year, Ciba Composites sold Fibrelam® panels (the first non-metallic aircraft flooring materials) to Boeing for the Boeing 747 aircraft.[16]
In 1975, Hexcel acquired a company that specialized in graphite weaving technology and in 1977, it purchased Tower Scientific (a manufacturer of replacement knee, hip, and shoulder joints).[17] In 1980, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1981 the company sold its line of medical products. Hexcel also purchased French glass fiber and woven industrial materials manufacturer Stevens-Genin S.A and Seal Sands Chemical Co. Ltd. (an English specialty chemicals manufacturer).[18] In 1983, the company was re-incorporated in Delaware. Hexcel Composites began to be used in major projects including the space shuttle Columbia and the Voyager aircraft.[19]
In 1986, Chairman of the Board and CEO Merrill retired as CEO and was succeeded by President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Witt.[20] In 1987, the company started plans to build a new $25 million plant in Chandler, Arizona to facilitate its participation in building the U.S. military's Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (for which Hexcel provided "low observable" ["LO"] materials).[21] Company co-founder Roscoe “Bud” Thomas Hughes Jr. died in 1986. In the same year, Hexcel inaugurated the Kenneth M. Holland Research Center in Dublin, California. The company began developing its own resin systems and its own domestic supply of carbon fibers precursor in Decatur (Alabama). Hexcel’s Ciba-Geigy purchased Heath Tecna in 1988.[22]
1990 to 2000[edit]
In 1990, Hexcel started working with Japanese company Dai Nippon Printing and Chemicals. The firms began manufacturing Nomex honeycomb, advanced composites and decorative laminates for the Japanese market.[23] Also in 1990, the company started developing a resilient thermoplastic honeycomb called Hexalite.[24] Hexcel materials started being used in high-speed trains, fishing rods, golf clubs, baseball bats, bicycle frames, and other goods. The company also manufactured chemicals that were used as ingredients in Alka-Seltzer tablets, Scope (mouthwash), and Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup.[25]
In 1993, CEO Bob Witt resigned and was replaced by company directors John Lee and John Doyle. In 1994, Hexcel sold its Teesside, England fine chemicals business, as well as European resins businesses. In 1995, the company sold its U.S. resins operations. Also in 1995, Hexcel acquired Ciba Composites from Ciba-Geigy Limited. The business included prepregs, honeycomb, structures, film adhesives, panels and interiors. In 1996, the firm acquired the Composites Products Division of Hercules Incorporated. Included in the acquisition were Hercules facilities in Magna, Utah, Decatur, Alabama, and Madrid (Spain).[26]
In 1996, Hexcel moved its corporate headquarters from California to Stamford, Connecticut.[27] In 1997, Hexcel acquired Fiberite’s satellite prepreg product line. In 1998, Hexcel formed a partnership with Sika Finanz AG, a construction chemicals and structural adhesives company. The partnership resulted in the development and production of composite systems for the construction industry. Also in 1998, Hexcel acquired Clark-Schwebel.[28]
In 1999, Hexcel formed BHA Aero Composite parts with Boeing and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (formally known as China Aviation Industry Corporation).[29] Also in 1999, Hexcel formed Asian Composites Manufacturing with Boeing, Sime Darby Sdn. Bhd., and Naluri Berhad (formally Malaysian Helicopter Services) to manufacture composite parts for commercial aviation.[30]




Carbon fiber


2000 to Present[edit]
In 2001, David Berges was appointed Hexcel’s Chairman, President and CEO. In 2002, Hexcel inaugurated BHA Aero Composites Parts Co. Ltd (China) and Asian Composites Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia).[31] In October 2003, Hexcel opened a new production unit in Les Avenières (France) that focused on carbon fiber weaving and multiaxials.[32]
In 2004, Hexcel closed its Livermore (California) manufacturing facility and transferred its operations to its Salt Lake City facility. In 2005, the company supplied HexPly® M21 and 8552 prepregs, RTM 6 resins, Injectex® fabrics, Redux® adhesives, HexWeb® honeycombs and machined and heat-formed honeycomb parts to the Airbus A380 program.[33][34]
In 2007, Hexcel opened a prepreg plant in Stade (Germany). The same year, the company won the JEC aerospace innovation award for Acousti-Cap® noise-reducing honeycomb for aircraft engines.[35] In 2009, Hexcel began production of prepregs and other composite materials predominantly for the American wind energy industry. In 2013, Nick L. Stanage was named Hexcel’s President and Chief Executive Officer and joined the company’s Board of Directors.[36]
In 2014, company co-founder Roger C. Steele died at age 93. In September 2014, Hexcel started production of a new precursor and carbon fiber lines in Roussillon (France). In 2016, the company acquired Formax UK Limited, a manufacturer of composite reinforcements located in Leicester, U.K. In January 2016, Hexcel announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in Casablanca, Morocco.[37]
In May 2016, Hexcel opened an Innovation Center in Duxford (U.K.).[38] It also formed a partnership with Oxford Performance Materials (OPM), a company that produces thermoplastic, carbon fiber reinforced 3D printed parts for Commercial aviation and Space and Defense applications.[39] In December 2016, Hexcel Corporation formed a partnership with Carbon Conversions Incorporated (CCI), a company that specializes in carbon fiber recycling and repurposing.[40]

History[edit]
1946 to 1970[edit]
Hexcel was founded in 1946 in San Francisco Bay by engineers Roger C. Steele and Roscoe T. “Bud” Hughes.[10] In 1948, chemist Ken Holland and economist Paul Ammen joined Hughes and Steele, and the company was incorporated in California, U.S. In 1955, the company's name changed to Hexcel Products, Inc. (the name derived from the hexagonal cell-shaped honeycomb materials that the company manufactured).[11]
Hexcel produced cellular structures made from galvanized fiberglass, as well as aluminum and other materials.[12] These were lighter in weight and stronger than steel, and became widely used in the aircraft industry.[13] Hexcel products also started being used in military and commercial aviation, as well as in the United States space program.[14] In 1968, Hexcel purchased Coast Manufacturing (including its manufacturing plants in California, Texas, and Ohio). In 1969, Harvie M. Merrill became CEO.[15]




Honeycomb composite material






Fabric roll


1970 to 1990[edit]
In 1971, the company manufactured and retailed skis made of composite materials. In 1974, Hexcel began supplying complex contoured parts (speed brakes on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle). The same year, Ciba Composites sold Fibrelam® panels (the first non-metallic aircraft flooring materials) to Boeing for the Boeing 747 aircraft.[16]
In 1975, Hexcel acquired a company that specialized in graphite weaving technology and in 1977, it purchased Tower Scientific (a manufacturer of replacement knee, hip, and shoulder joints).[17] In 1980, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1981 the company sold its line of medical products. Hexcel also purchased French glass fiber and woven industrial materials manufacturer Stevens-Genin S.A and Seal Sands Chemical Co. Ltd. (an English specialty chemicals manufacturer).[18] In 1983, the company was re-incorporated in Delaware. Hexcel Composites began to be used in major projects including the space shuttle Columbia and the Voyager aircraft.[19]
In 1986, Chairman of the Board and CEO Merrill retired as CEO and was succeeded by President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Witt.[20] In 1987, the company started plans to build a new $25 million plant in Chandler, Arizona to facilitate its participation in building the U.S. military's Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (for which Hexcel provided "low observable" ["LO"] materials).[21] Company co-founder Roscoe “Bud” Thomas Hughes Jr. died in 1986. In the same year, Hexcel inaugurated the Kenneth M. Holland Research Center in Dublin, California. The company began developing its own resin systems and its own domestic supply of carbon fibers precursor in Decatur (Alabama). Hexcel’s Ciba-Geigy purchased Heath Tecna in 1988.[22]
1990 to 2000[edit]
In 1990, Hexcel started working with Japanese company Dai Nippon Printing and Chemicals. The firms began manufacturing Nomex honeycomb, advanced composites and decorative laminates for the Japanese market.[23] Also in 1990, the company started developing a resilient thermoplastic honeycomb called Hexalite.[24] Hexcel materials started being used in high-speed trains, fishing rods, golf clubs, baseball bats, bicycle frames, and other goods. The company also manufactured chemicals that were used as ingredients in Alka-Seltzer tablets, Scope (mouthwash), and Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup.[25]
In 1993, CEO Bob Witt resigned and was replaced by company directors John Lee and John Doyle. In 1994, Hexcel sold its Teesside, England fine chemicals business, as well as European resins businesses. In 1995, the company sold its U.S. resins operations. Also in 1995, Hexcel acquired Ciba Composites from Ciba-Geigy Limited. The business included prepregs, honeycomb, structures, film adhesives, panels and interiors. In 1996, the firm acquired the Composites Products Division of Hercules Incorporated. Included in the acquisition were Hercules facilities in Magna, Utah, Decatur, Alabama, and Madrid (Spain).[26]
In 1996, Hexcel moved its corporate headquarters from California to Stamford, Connecticut.[27] In 1997, Hexcel acquired Fiberite’s satellite prepreg product line. In 1998, Hexcel formed a partnership with Sika Finanz AG, a construction chemicals and structural adhesives company. The partnership resulted in the development and production of composite systems for the construction industry. Also in 1998, Hexcel acquired Clark-Schwebel.[28]
In 1999, Hexcel formed BHA Aero Composite parts with Boeing and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (formally known as China Aviation Industry Corporation).[29] Also in 1999, Hexcel formed Asian Composites Manufacturing with Boeing, Sime Darby Sdn. Bhd., and Naluri Berhad (formally Malaysian Helicopter Services) to manufacture composite parts for commercial aviation.[30]




Carbon fiber


2000 to Present[edit]
In 2001, David Berges was appointed Hexcel’s Chairman, President and CEO. In 2002, Hexcel inaugurated BHA Aero Composites Parts Co. Ltd (China) and Asian Composites Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia).[31] In October 2003, Hexcel opened a new production unit in Les Avenières (France) that focused on carbon fiber weaving and multiaxials.[32]
In 2004, Hexcel closed its Livermore (California) manufacturing facility and transferred its operations to its Salt Lake City facility. In 2005, the company supplied HexPly® M21 and 8552 prepregs, RTM 6 resins, Injectex® fabrics, Redux® adhesives, HexWeb® honeycombs and machined and heat-formed honeycomb parts to the Airbus A380 program.[33][34]
In 2007, Hexcel opened a prepreg plant in Stade (Germany). The same year, the company won the JEC aerospace innovation award for Acousti-Cap® noise-reducing honeycomb for aircraft engines.[35] In 2009, Hexcel began production of prepregs and other composite materials predominantly for the American wind energy industry. In 2013, Nick L. Stanage was named Hexcel’s President and Chief Executive Officer and joined the company’s Board of Directors.[36]
In 2014, company co-founder Roger C. Steele died at age 93. In September 2014, Hexcel started production of a new precursor and carbon fiber lines in Roussillon (France). In 2016, the company acquired Formax UK Limited, a manufacturer of composite reinforcements located in Leicester, U.K. In January 2016, Hexcel announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in Casablanca, Morocco.[37]
In May 2016, Hexcel opened an Innovation Center in Duxford (U.K.).[38] It also formed a partnership with Oxford Performance Materials (OPM), a company that produces thermoplastic, carbon fiber reinforced 3D printed parts for Commercial aviation and Space and Defense applications.[39] In December 2016, Hexcel Corporation formed a partnership with Carbon Conversions Incorporated (CCI), a company that specializes in carbon fiber recycling and repurposing.[40]

Products / Fabrics/Reinforcements / Woven Reinforcements / HexForce ® Reinforcements / Glass Fiber Reinforcements












          
                    Glass Fiber Reinforcements
        
        

The versatility of glass as a fiber makes it unique industrial textile material. Woven glass fibers offer an excellent combination of properties from high strength to fire resistance at a more affordable cost. Wide ranges of yarn sizes and weave patterns provide huge number of design potential allowing the end user to choose the best combination for material performance, economics and flexibility. Hexcel produces Glass Fiber Reinforcements in a wide variety of areal weights, from 48 to 1300 gsm.Dimensional Stability: glass fiber is a dimensionally stable engineering material that does not stretch or shrink after exposure to extremely high or low temperatures. The maximum elongation for “E” glass at break is 4.8% with a 100% elastic recovery when stressed close to its point of rupture.Moisture Resistance: glass fibers do not absorb moisture, and do not change physically or chemically when exposed to water.High Strength: the high strength-to-weight ratio of glass fiber makes it a superior material in applications where high strength and minimum weight are required. In textile form, this strength can be unidirectional or bidirectional, allowing flexibility in design and cost.Fire Resistance: glass fiber is an inorganic material and will not burn or support combustion. It retains approximately 25% of its initial strength at 1000°F (540°C).Chemical Resistance: most chemicals have little or no effect on glass fiber. The inorganic glass textile fibers will not mildew, rot or deteriorate. Glass fibers are affected by hydrofluoric, hot phosphoric acids and strong alkaline substances.Electrical Properties: glass fiber is an excellent material for electrical insulation. The combination of properties such as low moisture absorption, high strength, heat resistance and low dielectric constant makes fiber glass fabrics ideal as a reinforcement for printed circuit boards and insulating varnishes.Thermal Conductivity: a low coefficient of thermal expansion combined with high thermal conductivity properties makes glass fabric a dimensionally stable material that rapidly dissipates heat as compared to asbestos and organic fibers.
