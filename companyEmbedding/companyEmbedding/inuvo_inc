FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

INUVO Acquires NetSeer -- Strengthening its Suite of Ad-Technology with In-Image Advertising 
   Email this page  |    Print page  |    Share this page  
 


LITTLE ROCK, AR--(Marketwired - Feb 7, 2017) -  Inuvo, Inc. (NYSE MKT: INUV), an advertising technology and digital publishing company, today announced that it had purchased substantially all the assets of Silicon Valley based NetSeer, Inc., a provider of visual monetization solutions for advertisers and publishers. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Inuvo issued 3.53 million shares of INUV common stock and assumed specified liabilities related to the business. Inuvo's management will discuss the acquisition at its conference call scheduled for February 13th. See www.inuvo.com for details. 
With the acquisition of NetSeer, INUV will be adding a host of direct and agency advertising demand partners, valuable consumer interest data, new direct publisher relationships for cross-selling and sophisticated programmatic ad-technology and analytics," said Mr. Richard Howe, Chairman and CEO of INUV. "NetSeer's Visual Monetization Platform with its In-Image ad technology will expand Inuvo's existing SearchLinks™ product suite thus increasing the value INUV can bring to publishers. We anticipate the acquisition will be a strong contributor to growth and be accretive to AEBITDA within 12-months."
NetSeer's patented ConceptGraph™ intent based ad targeting system delivers exceptional results for advertisers and publishers. ConceptGraph offers an accurate, nuanced picture of an audience's mindset -- which results in algorithms that think more like humans, and less like machines resulting in a more precise and predictive targeting solution.
"We're delighted to be a part of Inuvo," said John Mracek, NetSeer CEO. "Leveraging Inuvo's innovative product line and broad customer reach, NetSeer's dominant Visual Monetization business is now poised to grow even faster. The combined Inuvo/NetSeer product line of valuable and engaging ad units will allow publishers to improve both the experience and revenue generated from their websites."
"Inuvo's exceptional people and culture excites us even more to be INUV stockholders," said Terry Opdendyk, founder of ONSET Ventures and NetSeer's largest stockholder. "Combined with NetSeer's technology and innovation, Inuvo has a big opportunity to create substantial value for all Inuvo stakeholders."
About NetSeer, Inc.
        NetSeer provides market leading visual monetization solutions for advertisers and publishers backed by its patented ConceptGraph™ intent engine. The company is based in Sunnyvale, CA. For more information visit: www.netseer.com. NetSeer's financial advisor for the transaction was Headwaters MB.
