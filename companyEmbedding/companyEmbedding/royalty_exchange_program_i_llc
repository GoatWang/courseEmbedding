Royalty Exchange is an American company where royalty owners have the ability to monetize their royalties and investors seeking to purchase alternative assets may invest in them.  It is a centralized marketplace and online auction where investors and owners of royalty collections may buy and sell royalties as alternative investments including music royalties and film royalties, patent and IP (intellectual property) royalties, trade secret royalties, renewable energy royalties, solar energy royalties, technology licensing royalties, book publishing royalties, franchise royalties, copyright royalties and agriculture royalties.[1][2]
Royalty Exchange offers an online auction platform that provides investors with an overview of royalty income data as well as full details and legal documentation regarding all presented assets. After an online auction for a royalty asset has closed, the winning bidder or investor, is provided a percentage of ownership and the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.  Royalty owners may sell any percentage of their royalties and are permitted to set the reserve price and minimum bid amount. 

 File:Roylaty Exchange.jpg   

Background
Royalty Exchange was founded in 2011 in Raleigh, North Carolina.[1] and was launched by industry insiders who identified a need for a royalties-based online marketplace. The online platform provides asset owners flexibility to monetize a select portion, or the entirety, of their royalty streams, raising expedited capital for their professional or personal finance needs. [3] The founding team was lead by Sean Peace, serial tech entrepreneur and CEO, Reggie Calloway, singer/songwriter and 5-time Grammy nominated artist, as well as Wilson Owens, former band manager.[2]
The idea behind Royalty Exchange evolved after Peace’s communication with a former professor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and aspiring songwriter, whom he had met while attending the university. During his discussion with the former professor, Peace discovered that post-retirement, she planned to sell her catalog of music royalties.  A songwriter’s catalog consists of the royalty interest in the artist’s work for sale, packaged to be sold to investors. He used the idea of selling a catalog based on a financial multiple of how much it made during prior years and integrated the auction mechanics like those of SongVest, into forming an online marketplace to buy and sell royalties of all kinds.[4]
Royalty Exchange consists of a team of professionals including Molly Pennington, Director of Operations, Sean Daley, VP of Marketing, Brian Casto, VP of Sales and Business Development, Reggie Calloway, VP of West Coast Sales, Preston Sullivan, VP of East Coast Sales, Rusty Harmon, VP of Sales and Mark Paris., Lead Developer.  The company’s board of advisors includes Jonathan Hoenig, Managing Member of Capitallstpig Hedge Fund LLC, Tom Lipsky, Music LLC Owner and President, Don Perry, Entertainment Industry Consultant and Business Advisor, Klaus Lovegreen, Owner at Evershift and Founder of AME Info, Martin Diessner, Co-Founder of Flip Media and Tech Investor, Hans Bald, Chief Executive Officer of 20 Gates Management, and Josh Brog, Managing Director of 20 Gates Management.[5]

 History 
The first successfully completed online auction featured on the Royalty Exchange website began on July 2, 2011, and closed on July 16, 2011. The online auction included royalties of Disney song writer Frank Churchill’s catalog.[6]  The catalog consists of songs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (“Heigh Ho,” “Whistle While You Work,” “I’m Wishing” and “Someday My Prince Will Come”), Dumbo (“Baby Mine” and “Pink Elephants on Parade”) and Bambi (“Love is a Song” and “Little April Shower”).[4]
Throughout the company’s growth, numerous online auctions have been successfully closed including the $85,000 sale of 100% of the songwriter’s share of ASCAP public performance royalties generated by Frank Sinatra’s, “A Nightingale Sings in Berkley Square,” and other compositions written by Manning Sherwin; the $156,000 sale of 50% of the writer’s share of BMI public performance royalties generated from a collection of over 98 songs by R&B singer-songwriter and producer Kashif; the $26,000 sale of 100% of Cheryl Cook’s BMI writer’s share of public performance royalties to 31 tracks including songs recorded by Jennifer Lopez, Sugarhill Gang and more; accumulated royalty-produced assets from songs by Preston Glass, Edmund Clement and other previous sales which can be viewed on the Royalty Exchange website.[7][8]
On August 7, 2014, Royalty Exchange closed its first ever multi-unit auction, a type of auction where the asset is securitized or divided into multiple units allowing for numerous buyers to bid on and win small or large amounts of the asset. The auction consisted of producer royalties for 11 tracks recorded and performed by the alternative rock band, 3 Doors Down.[9]
On August 13, 2014, Royalty Exchange announced its partnership with Fender Music Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the growth of music education through donation of instruments and equipment to schools, after-school programs and music therapy programs.[10] The partnership provides a new platform for revenue-based donations made by songwriters, publishers and performers via their royalty rights auctioned through Royalty Exchange.  Both a percentage of the standard seller auction fee and ongoing administration fee is also donated to the Fender Music Foundation.[11]
In September 2014, Royalty Exchange closed its first renewable energy auction.  The online auction consisted of royalty interests to the electricity gross revenue production from 2 geothermal plants owned by Berkshire Hathaway, operated by MidAmerican Energy’s CalEnergy in California. [11]
Royalty Exchange created and rolled out a tool called the Royalty Analysis Tool.  The Royalty Analysis Tool offers royalty owners the ability to generate a personal report of their royalties.  The analysis tool provides a view of PRO royalty data and allows for the royalty owner to view their potential revenue that will accumulate over time.  The Royalty Analysis Tool supports the following providers: ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and The Orchard. [12][13]
Since Royalty Exchange first was formed in 2011, the company has been featured in CNN, Billboard, Forbes, Yahoo! Finance and USA Today, as well as on Bloomberg Television, Fox Business, the Huffington Post, Music Row Magazine and BestThinking.com.

Resource Royalty, LLC Goes Full-Cycle on Closing Fund
 Dallas, TX,  June 26, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Resource Royalty, LLC, an investment company founded by Gary Redwine and Bob Howard in 2010, announces the divestment of Resource Royalty Fund, LLC (2011)—making it the first fund to go “full-cycle.”Resource Royalty Fund, LLC (2011) distributed 61% to its limited partners over a 51/2-fund life prior to the final disposition of assets. Assets were sold in the first quarter of 2017 and limited partners subsequently received disposition proceeds equaling 101% of their original investment. Limited partners received a total return of investment of 162% over the period.The fund portfolio consisted of 11 royalty properties in the Cana-Woodford region of Central Oklahoma. The majority of the properties were operated by Devon Energy, a multi-billion dollar NYSE-listed operator. Devon has drilled over 500 wells in the region and recently announced that the region contains multiple layers of oil and gas bearing rock. The region is now called the “Stack Play,” and is one of the most active regions in the US with 36 working drilling rigs.Company management said, “The successful full-cycle of Resource Royalty Fund, LLC is a clear example of our acquisition philosophy where we target the most active oil regions of the country under the best operators. The dramatic increase in wells on the properties offset the big decline in commodity prices.”The property portfolio had a diversified commodity mix, receiving income from oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. At the time the properties were sold, the properties were receiving royalty income from 40 wells—a significant increase from the six producing wells when they were purchased in 2011.Considering that the oil price was $90-$100/bbl when acquired and $40-$50 when sold, fund results are impressive. One of the keys to the success of the fund is proper portfolio diversification and astute diligence on choosing locations where additional wells would be drilled.“Our properties have current income and significant growth potential. This helps ensure capital preservation and appreciation for our limited partners and works to combat the variable nature of commodity prices and production levels. We have built nine funds using this solid principle,” said management.The General Partner, Resource Royalty, LLC, utilizes decades of oil and gas experience to create highly strategic and diversified royalty and mineral investment partnerships. Its team of skilled investment and private equity professionals, as well as mineral acquisition analysts, work together to provide developmental royalty partnerships and 1031 exchange solutions to investors. As of June 5th, 2017, the company has offered nine funds and several institutional transactions, totaling in excess of $100M.For more information, contact:Bob Howard, Managing Member, at (214)-691-5234, or visit resourceroyaltyllc.com

Music Royalties Guide

















Overview
The music industry relies on royalties generated by the licensing of copyrighted songs and recordings as a primary form of payment for musicians. Intellectual property law and licensing systems have gone through significant adjustments over recent years as a result of the rise of digital music, but much of the industry's historic legal framework remains.
To start thinking about music in legal terms, it's important to realize that there are two types of musicians: songwriters and performing artists. These hold two distinct copyrights: songwriters hold the rights to the lyrics and melody of a piece of music, while performing artists hold the rights to a particular recording of a song, which is called a master recording. Songwriters may only seek copyright for a full song, and cannot divide lyrics and melody into separate rights.
Both songwriters and recording artists typically assign their rights to a third party for management, instead of attempting to track a song’s use and seek payment independently. Song copyrights are typically assigned to music publishers, while master recording copyrights are typically assigned to a record label.
How Royalty Exchange Helps Investors Generate IncomeHow Royalty Exchange Helps Artists Raise Money
Performance Royalties 
The fees music users pay when music is performed publicly. The use of music over the radio, in a restaurant or bar, or over a service like Spotify or Pandora is considered a public performance.

Performance Rights Organizations or PROs (in the US that’s BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC) collect songwriting performance royalties from music users and then pay songwriters and rights holders (publishers).


Like BMI and ASCAP, SoundExchange collects recording performance royalties for recording artists and labels whenever a music is performed publicly — but only for digital performances.


That’s because copyright regulation as it stands means terrestrial broadcasters (AM/FM radio) pay performance royalties to songwriters, but not the recording artists.


Digital performances (for example, Pandora) pay a recording digital performance royalty to SoundExchange and a songwriting digital performance royalty to the PROs.


But on the flip-side, BMI and ASCAP are governed by consent decrees, which means an arm of the US Judicial Branch (called a “rate-court”) can set the rates (per radio play, per stream, etc.). BMI and ASCAP collect for songwriting performance royalties. In exchange for the right to collect on behalf of songwriters across America, they are limited in their ability to negotiate by this rate court.


SoundExchange isn’t governed by a consent decree, which means they can negotiate on the free market. This is where things get complicated. Recording artists get paid nothing when their music is played on AM/FM radio (because there’s no performance right for recordings on terrestrial radio), but they are typically paid at least  5 times more than songwriters when music is performed digitally, like on Pandora. That’s because of SoundExchange’s negotiation power, and BMI/ASCAP’s limitations. AM/FM broadcasters do pay songwriters, but it’s at a royalty rate ultimately set by the courts.

Mechanical Royalties
Mechanical royalties paid to songwriters and artists when music is licensed (think CD or vinyl) but also when music is streamed (streaming mechanicals) “on-demand” (like Spotify). Songwriting mechanical royalties are set by government through what’s called a compulsory license, which right now is set to about 9.1 cents per copy.

Current copyright regulation wasn’t created at a time when services like Spotify or Beats existed, (which are kind of a hybrid of ‘performance’ and a ‘sale’) so they pay both performance royalties and mechanical royalties to songwriters and artists.


Spotify pays about 10% of its revenue to songwriters (split between mechanical and performance royalties) and about 60% to the artists. Services like Spotify don’t have to negotiate with songwriters because the government sets the rates – through the consent decree for PROs and a compulsory license for mechanical licenses.


Mechanical royalties for songwriting are usually paid by labels or artists to a third party, (traditionally for the major publisher it’s been HFA (the Harry Fox Agency), who pay the publishers.

Recording Copyrights
With a master recording copyright, a record label seeks to collect royalties from the use of a specific recording of a song. Master royalties are paid to a label when the label’s recording is used in an advertisement, film, television program, streaming service or other medium. Master royalties are typically paid in addition to synchronization or public performance royalties, as royalties paid to the publisher only grant the rights to the use of a song, not a specific recording of a song.
Terrestrial radio stations do not typically pay master royalties, as radio play has traditionally been viewed as free advertisement for a recording. However, radio play may or may not have a positive impact on sales, and congress is considering legislating that the royalty be paid. At present, recording artists only earn master royalties from radio when their recordings are played in a non-interactive digital arena where the listener is a subscriber (i.e. satellite radio).

About Royalty Exchange









About Royalty Exchange
Artists turn to Royalty Exchange to raise money and take control of their financial future. We connect them with private investors through the world’s first online marketplace for buying and selling royalties. Creators love us because we give them a powerful new way to fund their career. Investors love us because we help them generate income that's hard to beat. And our commitment to transparency and honesty ensures value for all.
Originally founded in 2011 and privately held, Royalty Exchange is based in Denver, CO. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

Our Mission
We're committed to unlocking the financial power of intellectual property to everyone.
Until now, royalty transactions took place in private. They were available only to industry insiders who held all the cards. 
This kept prices low and values cloaked in mystery. Deals were all-or-nothing, take-it-or-leave-it offers. Only the biggest and richest creators could attract interested buyers. And private investors lost out on opportunities for significant returns.
We're disrupting this outdated system. Our online marketplace introduces competition, transparency, and honesty to the process. It brings together creators and investors to offer something the other needs, and share a mutual benefit.
The result creates more value for everyone involved. Creators get access to interested buyers, as well as control over what they sell and who they sell to. Investors get access to royalty earning assets, and a liquid market to buy and sell them. And the industry gains free-market insights into the value of its intellectual property.
Our Vision
Royalty Exchange offer a stark alternative to the shady, bullying, and predatory practices that have defined the royalty business to date. Most companies offering to buy royalties are trying to get the best deal possible by paying as little as they can. Private advance companies are nothing more than payday lenders burying you in debt.
We don’t buy or sell royalties. We don’t provide advances or loans. We simply operate a marketplace where buyers, sellers, and lenders come together to conduct deals. Our success depends on maintaining the health of this marketplace. A healthy marketplace creates more value for all involved. So the better we do our job, the more opportunity we create for you.
When artists achieve artistic freedom through financial security, we win. When investors can finally generate meaningful returns on their investments, we win. And when our customers use the proceeds they earn on Royalty Exchange to create new value outside the confines of the marketplace itself, we all win.
That’s why we’re committed to transparency, honesty, and fairness. We let the free market dictate the price and terms that it will support. And we will never risk harming the health of the marketplace for the sake of an individual deal, no matter how much it may benefit us. 
After all, this isn’t our marketplace... it’s yours.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in. We’re a marketplace where these types of royalty assets are bought and sold. We specialize in intellectual property with a documented track record of regular, consistent income.

Through our one-of-a-kind platform, investors can buy privately owned royalty rights directly from the artists, inventors and creators. In a world of negative interest rates, these income-generating royalty rights just might be the perfect investment.
To view all our current and past auctions, simply create a free account via the link below. The process takes less than 2 minutes, and you'll be able to explore all the fantastic income investments available across both Auctions and Advances.

					History			





 
Since our inception in 1996, Royalty Pharma has expanded the traditional parameters that define a pharmaceutical company. By focusing on intellectual property - the key to premium pricing and profits in the pharmaceutical industry - Royalty Pharma has become the global leader in the acquisition of royalty interests. Royalty Pharma has assembled a well-diversified and well-balanced portfolio of royalties in leading biopharmaceutical products achieving rapid and profitable growth with a managed risk profile.
The origins of Royalty Pharma can be traced to the 1980s when certain members of Royalty Pharma’s Investment Committee and Management Team pioneered the use of royalty interests to fund the clinical development of several leading biotechnology products through “Research & Development Partnerships.” In 1993 and 1994, when these R&D partnerships started earning royalties, two product-specific "proof of principle" acquisition vehicles were established to acquire royalty interests in Neupogen® and ReoPro®. The success of those efforts led to the founding in 1996 of Royalty Pharma’s predecessors: Pharmaceutical Royalties, LLC (Delaware, USA) and Pharmaceutical Royalty Investments, Ltd. (Bermuda). Subsequently in 2003, Royalty Pharma was established as an Irish Unit Trust, to consolidate the operations of its predecessors and to facilitate a new business model for the Company.
 
 
Over the years we have had a simple and consistent strategy – invest in leading therapeutics, typically billion dollar blockbuster products, addressing critical care indications or serious medical conditions and marketed by leading companies. To fulfill this strategy we have fostered a high-performing and diverse management team, focused in delivering superior value to our shareholders and striving to be a leader in every aspect of our industry.

Royalty Exchange Review - Crowdfunding Investment Platforms - YieldTalk                                 Share This Post    Royalty Exchange Review BookmarkClick for all your bookmarksSummaryRoyalty Exchange is an online auction platform for royalty rights (primarily related to music). Terms and details vary considerably from auction to auction, and the complexity and nuances of IP rights transactions likely puts this platform well outside the comfort zone of many investors, especially those without direct experience in IP rights sales.Investor OverviewCompany Information Investment types: Royalty Revenue Security types: Rights Contract Sectors: Entertainment, Music, Royalties  Accepts investments from non-accredited investors  ProsOpen to non-accredited investorsFluctuating but regular cash flowVery low correlation with other asset classesTransparent auction processSome rights include multiple income streams ConsSome auctions have high minimum bids ($100K or more)Inherent uncertainty in future cash flow from royaltiesRights transactions can be incredibly complex Company Description: Your online marketplace for buying and selling royalties Website: https://www.royaltyexchange.com Founded: 2011 Royalty Exchange on Twitter (@royaltyexchange) Royalty Exchange on Crunchbase Royalty Exchange Overview Founded in North Carolina in 2011 as a venture-backed startup, Royalty Exchange was sold to new ownership based out of Denver in 2015. Their public auction model stands out among alternative investment platforms.I worked in book publishing for well over a decade, and know firsthand that most commercial rights sales in the media business remain anything but transparent, so Royalty Exchange deserves kudos for working to bring more visibility and opportunity to both rights holders and buyers.Types of investments Royalty Exchange offersWhile specifics can vary considerably from auction to auction, you're investing in future income stream derived from royalty payments, primarily for music. For example, some auctions are for the "performance" rights associated with catalog of songs -- every time one of the songs is played on a TV show, in a movie, on satellite radio, in a commercial, etc., a royalty is collected by a performance society (eg ASCAP or BMI) and those payments are distributed out to the rights holders.Rights transactions can be incredibly complex, and investors should make sure to have a firm understanding of exactly what they're buying, including for how long.What do you get when investing with Royalty Exchange?Royalty investments are contractual claims on future royalty payments owed to a copyright holder (who has chosen to license out some or all of their future claim on those payments).Royalty Exchange fee structureRoyalty Exchange does not charge a fee to investors, they collect a fee from the rights sellers upon completion of a successful auction. Details about any additional fees are disclosed within the auction information (for example, fees to set up an account with the relevant rights society like BMI).Potential returns and cashflowRoyalty payments are typically made quarterly, either directly from an entity like ASCAP or BMI, or via Royalty Exchange itself. Returns vary greatly depending on the specifics catalog. Most royalty streams tend to be steady over time, with some opportunity for additional upside (for example, if a song in a catalog is chosen for use in a popular movie, commercial, or TV show). Most copyright extends for the lifetime of the author plus 70 years, so many of the royalty streams have the potential to extend quite far into the future.Breadth of offerings on Royalty ExchangeThere are 3 open auctions at the time of this writing, and Royalty Exchange has completed more than 100 auctions. Minimum bids vary considerably, but most auctions close in the $25-$75K range, with some outliers both below $10K, and above $100K.Regulatory framework and due diligence expectationsRoyalty Exchange performs an in-depth analysis of each catalog before opening for auction. That said, they also advertise to rights sellers that they "have a team of attorneys, accountants, and analysts that can make these deals happen fast", closing in less than 30 days, so prospective investors should keep that in mind as they perform their own due diligence in reviewing an auction.Final thoughtsMusic royalties definitely fall outside of the mainstream when it comes to alternative asset classes. While there is potential for steady long-term income and even occasional surprise upside, rights transactions and agreements can be quite complex, and so may be most interesting to those who already have some familiarity with IP and music rights.Screenshots‹› Media CoverageHere's more about Royalty Exchange from around the web:Royalties: The Alternative Assets of the Music Industry (FINalternatives)How to Make Money With Music (Magnetic Magazine)For Investors Who Want to Own a Piece of Natalie Cole, Usher, Garland (abc News)Similar Investment PlatformsOther platforms from our database that are similar to Royalty Exchange: 1031 CrowdfundingOnline marketplace for 1031 exchanges Acquire Real EstateBoston-based commercial real estate funding platform AgFunder ReviewInvest in AgTech Startups AlphaFlow ReviewManaged or Self-service investing across 9 real estate platforms American Homeowner Preservation ReviewInvest in distressed mortgages AngelListOnline angel-led investing syndicates, multiple $1B+ exits.
