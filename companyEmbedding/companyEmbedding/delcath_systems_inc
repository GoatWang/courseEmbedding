Delcath - About















 










About Us





About Delcath
Delcath Systems, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company focused on oncology. Our proprietary product-Melphalan Hydrochloride for Injection for use with the Delcath Hepatic Delivery System (Melphalan/HDS)-is designed to administer high dose chemotherapy to the liver, while controlling the systemic exposure to those agents. The Company's principal focus is on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. In the United States, the Melphalan/HDS system is considered a combination drug and device product, and is regulated as a drug by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Melphalan/HDS system has not been approved for sale in the United States. In Europe, our proprietary system to deliver and filter melphalan hydrochloride is marketed as a device under the trade name Delcath Hepatic CHEMOSATÂŽ Delivery System for Melphalan (CHEMOSAT). In April 2012, we obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation Two CHEMOSAT system. The right to affix the CE mark allows the Company to market and sell the CHEMOSAT system in Europe. The Company has commenced a global phase 2 clinical trial in Europe to investigate Melphalan/HDS system for primary liver cancer and is initiating plans to evaluate intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
History
Delcath has spent many years researching ways to administer ultra-high doses of established chemotherapeutic drugs to the liver.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Delcath Systems

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Delcath Systems, Inc. Delcath Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: DCTH) is a publicly-traded specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company[1] that develops percutaneous perfusion technologies for the targeted administration of high-dose chemotherapeutic agents to specific organs or regions of the body. Based in Queensbury, New York, the company has an intellectual property portfolio consisting of 28 patents worldwide. Delcath's Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion (PHP) is currently undergoing Phase II and Phase III trials against tumors in the liver.[2] Delcath has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute and has received Fast Track and a Special Protocol Assessment from the Food and Drug Administration for its use of melphalan in treating unresectable liver tumors. PHP, also known as the Delcath System, is tested for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in the liver and for primary liver cancer and metastatic hepatic malignancies from neuroendocrine cancers and adenocarcinomas, as well as patients with melanoma who previously received isolated perfusion. Chemotherapy is usually delivered intravenously, although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g. specialty drugs, melphalan (trade name Alkeran), busulfan, capecitabine).[3]

Delcath - About Clinical Trials















 









About Clinical Trials








Clinical trials are the backbone of modern medicine. Before a new therapeutic can be made available to the general public, rigorous tests involving multiple studies on human volunteers are required. These studies are referred to as clinical trials and are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, as well as similar regulatory agencies worldwide. Clinical Trials evaluate the efficacy, safety, and/or tolerability of drugs, devices, and other kinds of medical treatments. Each clinical trial is designed to answer specific questions about the treatment at the center of the study.
There are a few different types of clinical trials. They are usually divided into four categories or phases. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) define clinical trial phases in the following way:

Phase 1: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.Delcath completed Phase 1 trial.
Phase 2: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. Delcath completed multi-arm phase 2, NET results presented at ESMO 2011.
Phase 3: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Delcath completed randomized phase 3, preliminary results were presented at ASCO and updated at ESMO 2011.
Phase 4: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use.
Expanded Access Program: For patients who cannot participate in a clinical trial of an investigational drug, but have a serious disease or condition that may benefit from treatment with the drug, FDA regulations enable manufacturers of such drugs to provide those patients access to the drug under certain situations, known as “expanded access.” The intent of expanded access is to provide treatment for a patient’s disease or condition, rather than to collect data about the study drug.
