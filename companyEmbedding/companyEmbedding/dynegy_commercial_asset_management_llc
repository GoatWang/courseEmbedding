	About Dynegy 






	THE DYNEGY DIFFERENCE







At Dynegy, we deliver more than just power to residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers across several states. We are committed to being a leader in the electricity sector.
Throughout the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Texas, Dynegy operates power generating facilities capable of producing more than 31,000 megawatts of electricity – or enough energy to power the homes of 25 million U.S. families.
We’re proud of what we do, but it’s about much more than just output. We’re always striving to generate power safely and responsibly for our wholesale and retail electricity customers who depend on that energy to grow and thrive.
