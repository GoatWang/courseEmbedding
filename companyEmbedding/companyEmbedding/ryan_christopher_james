Yesterday i visited manchester to do some documenting, ive uploaded a small bulk to facebook but these few will not be used for projects, only to document it still hasnt properly sunk in yet to the attack that happened and those innocent lives lost, the city is calm but its strong and we wl rise above it, never forget,
@christopher_james_ryan
 2 19 12017-05-25T22:13:16
Feels odd being in manchester after whats happened, currently documenting around this city and its calm and quiet which is strange but its peaceful, alot of media is here documenting, nearly been 72 hours and you can see the people and the city untite, grow stonger and to give hope for the future
