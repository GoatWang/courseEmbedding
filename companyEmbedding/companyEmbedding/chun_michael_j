			Retired. Formerly President and Headmaster of Kamehameha Schools - Kapalama (a college preparatory school serving children of Hawaiian ancestry) from 2001 - 2012 and President, Kamehameha Schools from 1988 - 2012. As President and Headmaster, he was responsible for the leadership, financial management, administration and effectiveness of the college preparatory education program at the flagship Kapalama campus. Prior to his appointment at Kamehameha Schools, Dr. Chun was Vice President of Park Engineering, a Honolulu engineering consulting firm. He also served as Chief Engineer of the City and County of Honolulu and taught at the University of Hawaii where he directed graduate instruction and research in environmental engineering. In addition to being a director of Matson, Inc. (a shipping company that split from Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. in 2012), he serves on the boards of various professional and community organizations, including the Metropolitan Board of the YMCA of Honolulu, Partners in Development Foundation and USS Missouri Memorial. Dr. Chun received his bachelor of science degree in civil engineering and his Ph.D. in environmental engineering from the University of Kansas, and his M.S. in civil engineering from the University of Hawaii. Dr. Chun's leadership of one of Hawaii's premier educational institutions both provides him with insights into key segments of our markets and customer base and, together with his engineering background, assists the Board in its consideration of a range of operational matters. These insights inform the discussion at both the Board and on the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee on which all of the independent directors serve.

  Dr. Chun announces his retirement in 2012


Dr. 
  Michael J. Chun
  President and Headmaster
  Kamehameha Schools Kapälama
Aloha mai käkou,
When I accepted the job as President of Kamehameha Schools in 1988, I knew 
  I had an exciting opportunity before me, but I had no idea how deeply it would 
  change my life. What began with a simple dream to help our students and our 
  people realize their own goals and aspirations became a remarkable journey through 
  one of the most interesting periods in the history of Kamehameha Schools—one 
  marked by exciting opportunities, sobering events, significant growth and timely 
  changes. 
At every step in this journey were students, teachers, administrators, staff, 
  parents, alumni and friends of Kamehameha who inspired, excited, supported, 
  guided and mentored Aunty Bina and me with their enthusiasm, energy, talents, 
  wisdom, courage, integrity and loyalty. We have proudly watched thousands of 
  inspiring – and aspiring—Hawaiian students receive their diplomas, 
  knowing they are capable of succeeding anywhere in the world. 
This coming school year will be my 24th year as President and Headmaster of 
  the Kapälama campus. It will also be my last. This morning, I informed 
  our CEO, Dee Jay Mailer, and our campus leadership team of my decision to retire 
  at the end of the 2011–2012 school year. The next 15 months will allow 
  Kamehameha Schools to conduct a thorough search for the leader who will build 
  on the good work of the KSK staff and faculty over the last two decades. I believe 
  KSK is well-positioned for this transition. 
Our recently completed HAIS/WASC Self-study and Accreditation Visit affirms 
  the strength and quality of an exemplary academic program that is rooted in 
  the culture of the first peoples of our island home, from kindergarten through 
  graduation.
  Our campus master plan is well underway, including needed new facilities for 
  our middle school and the Kaÿiwakïloumoku cultural complex – 
  the dream of visionary former Trustee Myron “Pinky” Thompson. 
  Our campus leadership is skilled and prepared to lead through this transition. 
  
  KSK remains a beacon for all Hawaiians and is well-prepared to remain so far 
  into the future. While there is sadness and nostalgia in leaving a place filled 
  with such precious memories, cherished friendships and deep aloha, there is 
  also gratitude for being able to be part of such a wonderful ÿohana, and 
  excitement for all that lies ahead for our remarkable school. 
I Mua Kamehameha! 


Dee 
  Jay Mailer
  CEO
  Kamehameha Schools
Aloha mai käkou,
With expected humility, Dr. Michael Chun has tendered his resignation in a 
  letter filled with appreciation for the good fortune of being part of the remarkable 
  Kamehameha Schools ÿohana. This good fortune is mutual as Dr. Chun has 
  shaped our Schools in remarkable ways! 
On behalf of Kamehameha Schools, I thank him for his dedication to fulfilling 
  Pauahi’s vision and for 23 years of leadership marked by professionalism 
  and integrity and founded on Christian values and deep aloha for our haumäna 
  and their ‘ohana, our faculty and our staff. He will retire in June 2012 
  as the longest serving President in the history of Kamehameha Schools. 
Dr. Chun will continue to lead our Kapälama Campus through the next fifteen 
  months as we complete the search for the best leader to continue Dr. Chun’s 
  legacy. Under Dr. Chun’s leadership: 
Kapalama has made a dramatic shift away from being a school for Hawaiians, 
  to becoming a Hawaiian school. One small indicator: our Kapälama campus 
  haumäna are speaking ‘ölelo Hawaiÿi in classrooms, hallways 
  and our song contests fluently and with great pride and reverence for our ancestors. 
  They join many graduates before them who are fulfilling their kuleana, representing 
  our culture around the world. 
  College preparatory curriculum at Kapälama is an expectation, rather than 
  merely an option. Every graduate has met the requirements for college/university 
  admission and over 95 percent choose to go on to higher education upon graduation.
  The percentage of haumäna with need at KSK has risen substantially, fulfilling 
  Pauahi’s desire to serve those in indigent and orphaned circumstances.
  Kapälama was recently commended by the WASC accreditation team for its 
  strong, integrated K–12 academic, co-curricular and cultural learning 
  environment. We await official notification of accreditation.
  The renovation of Kapälama’s Middle School and dormatories, athletic 
  facilities and the building of Ka‘iwakïloumoku (our cultural center) 
  has begun! 
  Dr. Chun and his wife Bina have been our “first family,” symbolizing 
  the spirit of Kamehameha Schools: excellence, responsibility, service, compassion 
  and aloha. From launa at their home to attendance at every event where our haumäna 
  demonstrate their excellence, the Chuns have provided warm encouragement. It 
  is no wonder that so many of our graduates have emerged as exemplary servant 
  leaders in the tradition of Ke Ali‘i Pauahi. 
I look forward to watching all of the aloha that will pour out to Mike and 
  Bina Chun over the next year, knowing that even as new doors open before them, 
  this door called Kamehameha Schools will never close. 
I mua e Mike a me Bina! I Mua Kamehameha!
