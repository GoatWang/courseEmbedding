History[edit]
Founded in 1992 with the help of a licensing agreement with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[3] Metabolix, Inc. is a bioscience company with headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Metabolix provides sustainable solutions to the plastic, chemical and energy industries. Oliver Peoples, Ph.D., and Anthony Sinskey, Ph.D., co-founded Metabolix after work at the (MIT) that identified the elementary methods and means for engineering polyhydroxyalkanoates out of plants and bacteria, thus making them biodegradable.[5]
In April, 2012, Metabolix opened its first international office in Cologne, Germany. The office is strategically located in the BioCampus Cologne life science park, which has been one of Germany’s largest biotechnology parks since 2002.[4] This office was opened to handle business development, customer service, and technical support to Metabolix’s European business partners and biopolymer customers.
Current Work[edit]
Metabolix, Inc. is developing and commercializing high-performance PHA biopolymers for performance additives, film and bag applications, and functional biodegradation. Metabolix’s technology platforms are creating sustainable solutions in the world of plastics, chemicals and energy.[1] The company is also in the process of developing platforms to co-produce plastics, chemicals, and energy from crops [6]
Awards[edit]
Metabolix has been recognized for its research, development and product innovations through a series of prestigious awards and grants including: the “Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award” (2005),[7] the "New Technologies in Renewable Materials and Processes Award” (2006),[8] the “Technology Pioneer Award” (2010),[9] and the Museum of Science Boston’s “Invented Here!” award (2011).[10]
Products[edit]
Biopolymers[edit]
Metabolix performance PHA biopolymers are produced in microorganisms, and are therefore biodegradable by similar organisms present in environments such as soil and water.[11]
Mirel[edit]
Mirel soil and marine biodegradable polymers help to reduce plastic waste accumulation in the environment. Mirel is a product of corn sugar fermentation with proprietary genetically engineered bacteria.
In July 2007, Metabolix released a 100% biodegradable gift card product for Target. If put into a home composting area, the card would completely biodegrade in about 40 days.[12][13]
In 2010, Metabolix began work with Ball Horticultural to create SoilWraps using Mirel.[14] SoilWraps are bottomless biodegradable flower pots that can be planted directly in a home garden.[15]
Mvera[edit]
Metabolix has designed the Mvera product line for applications including compost bags and can liners used for organic waste, as well as shopping and retail bags that can be reused as compostable organic waste bags. In 2013, Metabolix launched Mvera B5010 and B5011, which are certified compostable by Vinçotte to meet the EN 13432 standard for compostable plastics. [16] [17] These compostable film resins are designed for blown/cast film processing with both opaque (B5010) and transparent (B5011) performance, and exhibit many of the same performance qualities of petroleum-based resins.[18]
In October 2011, Andolfi & C., an Italian films, packaging, and bags company, began using Mvera for a line of compostable plastic bags.[19]
Performance Additives[edit]
Metabolix is developing performance additives for a range of plastics in both the traditional and biobased markets. Metabolix has found PHA brings a number of performance benefits to plastics including PLA and PVC. Recently, they have announced a new grade designed specifically to modify PLA.[20] In this application, PHA acts as a flexibilizer and impact modifier.
PHA Latex[edit]
Metabolix recently announced that it is developing a new grade of PHA latex for paper coatings. [21]
Biobased Chemicals[edit]
Metabolix is working to create biochemicals that work as high-performance replacements for petroleum-based products, with focus on C3 and C4 chemicals.[22]
Biobased GBL/BDO[edit]
Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and butanediol (BDO) are industrial chemicals produced from hydrocarbons: natural gas, oil, and other fossil-based sources. Metabolix has developed a system for producing renewable GBL using a proprietary FAST system. The GBL can then be converted to BDO via a catalytic process.[22]
Biobased Acrylic Acid[edit]
Metabolix is developing techniques to produce sustainable biobased acrylic acid. The company is currently developing the FAST process for recovering acrylic acid.[23]
Crop Technologies[edit]
The centerpiece of the Metabolix’s plant technology is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the simplest member of the broad polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family of biopolymers. They have worked with switchgrass, camelina, sugarcane, as well as tobacco.[24]
In 2009, Metabolix completed a field trial producing PHA in a tobacco crop.[25]
In 2012, Metabolix secured an ARPA-E grant to improve productivity of biofuel production in plants, specifically camelina.[26]
In 2011, Metabolix was awarded a $6.0 million grant to produce PHB in switchgrass and to develop methods to thermally convert the PHB-containing switchgrass to crotonic acid and a higher density residual biomass fraction for production of biofuel.[27]
Joint Venture[edit]
In 2006, Metabolix and Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) announced a strategic alliance to manufacture and commercialize high-performance natural plastics.[28]
On January 13, 2012 ADM announced that it was terminating the joint venture. Metabolix's stock plunged 56% to $2.64 immediately following this announcement,[29] leading to a class action suit.
Lawsuit[edit]
Following the collapse of the Telles joint venture, shareholders of Metabolix filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that executives knowingly misled them about the viability of the production process of Mirel. The case, Coyne et al v. Metabolix, Inc., was filed on February 17, 2012 in Boston's federal court, citing Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. It names executives Eno and Hill in addition to Metabolix.[30][31] On September 20, 2013, the court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.[32]

History[edit]
Founded in 1992 with the help of a licensing agreement with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[3] Metabolix, Inc. is a bioscience company with headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Metabolix provides sustainable solutions to the plastic, chemical and energy industries. Oliver Peoples, Ph.D., and Anthony Sinskey, Ph.D., co-founded Metabolix after work at the (MIT) that identified the elementary methods and means for engineering polyhydroxyalkanoates out of plants and bacteria, thus making them biodegradable.[5]
In April, 2012, Metabolix opened its first international office in Cologne, Germany. The office is strategically located in the BioCampus Cologne life science park, which has been one of Germany’s largest biotechnology parks since 2002.[4] This office was opened to handle business development, customer service, and technical support to Metabolix’s European business partners and biopolymer customers.
Current Work[edit]
Metabolix, Inc. is developing and commercializing high-performance PHA biopolymers for performance additives, film and bag applications, and functional biodegradation. Metabolix’s technology platforms are creating sustainable solutions in the world of plastics, chemicals and energy.[1] The company is also in the process of developing platforms to co-produce plastics, chemicals, and energy from crops [6]
Awards[edit]
Metabolix has been recognized for its research, development and product innovations through a series of prestigious awards and grants including: the “Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award” (2005),[7] the "New Technologies in Renewable Materials and Processes Award” (2006),[8] the “Technology Pioneer Award” (2010),[9] and the Museum of Science Boston’s “Invented Here!” award (2011).[10]
Products[edit]
Biopolymers[edit]
Metabolix performance PHA biopolymers are produced in microorganisms, and are therefore biodegradable by similar organisms present in environments such as soil and water.[11]
Mirel[edit]
Mirel soil and marine biodegradable polymers help to reduce plastic waste accumulation in the environment. Mirel is a product of corn sugar fermentation with proprietary genetically engineered bacteria.
In July 2007, Metabolix released a 100% biodegradable gift card product for Target. If put into a home composting area, the card would completely biodegrade in about 40 days.[12][13]
In 2010, Metabolix began work with Ball Horticultural to create SoilWraps using Mirel.[14] SoilWraps are bottomless biodegradable flower pots that can be planted directly in a home garden.[15]
Mvera[edit]
Metabolix has designed the Mvera product line for applications including compost bags and can liners used for organic waste, as well as shopping and retail bags that can be reused as compostable organic waste bags. In 2013, Metabolix launched Mvera B5010 and B5011, which are certified compostable by Vinçotte to meet the EN 13432 standard for compostable plastics. [16] [17] These compostable film resins are designed for blown/cast film processing with both opaque (B5010) and transparent (B5011) performance, and exhibit many of the same performance qualities of petroleum-based resins.[18]
In October 2011, Andolfi & C., an Italian films, packaging, and bags company, began using Mvera for a line of compostable plastic bags.[19]
Performance Additives[edit]
Metabolix is developing performance additives for a range of plastics in both the traditional and biobased markets. Metabolix has found PHA brings a number of performance benefits to plastics including PLA and PVC. Recently, they have announced a new grade designed specifically to modify PLA.[20] In this application, PHA acts as a flexibilizer and impact modifier.
PHA Latex[edit]
Metabolix recently announced that it is developing a new grade of PHA latex for paper coatings. [21]
Biobased Chemicals[edit]
Metabolix is working to create biochemicals that work as high-performance replacements for petroleum-based products, with focus on C3 and C4 chemicals.[22]
Biobased GBL/BDO[edit]
Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and butanediol (BDO) are industrial chemicals produced from hydrocarbons: natural gas, oil, and other fossil-based sources. Metabolix has developed a system for producing renewable GBL using a proprietary FAST system. The GBL can then be converted to BDO via a catalytic process.[22]
Biobased Acrylic Acid[edit]
Metabolix is developing techniques to produce sustainable biobased acrylic acid. The company is currently developing the FAST process for recovering acrylic acid.[23]
Crop Technologies[edit]
The centerpiece of the Metabolix’s plant technology is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the simplest member of the broad polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family of biopolymers. They have worked with switchgrass, camelina, sugarcane, as well as tobacco.[24]
In 2009, Metabolix completed a field trial producing PHA in a tobacco crop.[25]
In 2012, Metabolix secured an ARPA-E grant to improve productivity of biofuel production in plants, specifically camelina.[26]
In 2011, Metabolix was awarded a $6.0 million grant to produce PHB in switchgrass and to develop methods to thermally convert the PHB-containing switchgrass to crotonic acid and a higher density residual biomass fraction for production of biofuel.[27]
Joint Venture[edit]
In 2006, Metabolix and Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) announced a strategic alliance to manufacture and commercialize high-performance natural plastics.[28]
On January 13, 2012 ADM announced that it was terminating the joint venture. Metabolix's stock plunged 56% to $2.64 immediately following this announcement,[29] leading to a class action suit.
Lawsuit[edit]
Following the collapse of the Telles joint venture, shareholders of Metabolix filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that executives knowingly misled them about the viability of the production process of Mirel. The case, Coyne et al v. Metabolix, Inc., was filed on February 17, 2012 in Boston's federal court, citing Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. It names executives Eno and Hill in addition to Metabolix.[30][31] On September 20, 2013, the court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.[32]

Corporate Overview





Metabolix Inc., founded in 1992, is an advanced biomaterials company focused on delivering sustainable solutions to the plastics industry. We have core capabilities in microbial genetics, fermentation process engineering, chemical engineering, polymer science, plant genetics and botanical science, and we have assembled these capabilities in a way that has allowed us to integrate our biotechnology research with real world chemical engineering and industrial practice. In addition, we have created an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect our innovations which, together with our technology, serves as a valuable foundation for our business and future industry collaborations.
Metabolix was formed to leverage the ability of natural systems to produce complex biopolymers from renewable resources. We have focused on a family of biopolymers found in nature called PHAs, which occur naturally in living organisms and are chemically similar to polyesters. We have demonstrated the production of PHAs at industrial scale for biopolymers. 
We are specifically targeting our research, development and commercial resources on the use of our Mirel® PHA biopolymers as performance additives in target applications where they can improve performance and or reduce cost in other material systems such as PVC and PLA. We also expect to address applications where the performance, biodegradability, biobased content and other attributes of our PHA biopolymers provide unique functional advantages, such as biodegradation, required by such applications, including PHA coated paper and PHA micropowders. Metabolix’s proprietary biotechnology platform enables creation of specialty biopolymers for use in a broad range of applications such as construction and packaging materials, as well as industrial, consumer and personal care products.

Non Technical Summary The widespread use of synthetic plastics has increased concerns over their adverse environmental impacts, and dramatic fluctuations in the cost and availability of petrochemical sources for plastic production creates the need for renewable, environmentally-friendly plastics derived from agricultural sources. Blow molded products are used widely in packaging, and are a major component of the plastics manufacturing industry that are suitable for replacement by biobased materials. This project will demonstrate the use of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a family of bioplastics made by the biological conversion of agricultural feedstocks, in commercial-scale blow molding manufacturing operations. Advances in PHA formulation and processing technology developed in Phase 1 of the project demonstrated the feasibility of blow molding PHAs at the lab-scale. In this program, PHA formulations will be improved with the necessary melt strength and crystallization behavior for blow molding operations using existing equipment at current production fficiencies, while providing the key physical properties needed in the blow molded part. Once satisfactory formulations are developed, pilot blow molding trials will be conducted to confirm proper rheological behavior of the PHA formulations and physical properties of the molded part. Metabolix will then demonstrate blow molding on commercial scale equipment running at typical manufacturing speeds.

Goals / Objectives The specific technical objectives of Phase 2 of this project are to develop biobased PHA resin formulations with processing properties suitable for large-scale blow molding operations, demonstrate blow molding at commercial scale, map the physical properties of the blow molded product, and optimize blow molding cycle times to that of commercial production specifications. Metabolix will use a combination of high molecular weight biobased PHAs, in conjunction with reactive extrusion processes, to create blends of branched and linear PHAs with the required rheological properties and melt strength for blow molding operations on commercial scale equipment. These formulations will be further improved in conjunction with blow molding process optimization to achieve commercial line speeds and meet full end-use container physical properties. Success in this project will open up a large segment of the current thermoplastics market to biobased PHA products.
						

Project Methods The following tasks are critical to the successful development of PHA resin formulations suitable for blow molding and the production of blow molded products from biobased PHA polymers: 1. Synthesis and molecular characterization of branched PHAs; 2. Production and characterization of blends of linear and branched PHAs of varying molecular weights and compositions; 3. Conduct lab-scale blow molding, measure and map physical properties of item; 4. Conduct commercial-scale blow molding, measure and map physical properties of item; 5. Optimize formulation to meet commercial scale blow molding times. Results obtained from Phase 1 of the program will form the basis for moving forward with Task 1 and 2 to develop formulations that have the desired elastic and viscous properties at the preferred processing conditions for PHAs. Lab-scale blow molding operations similar to that conducted in the Phase 1 project will be conducted to demonstrate improved melt strength and required rheological behavior needed for larger scale blow molding operations. Physical properties of the blow molded object will be measured and mapped as a basis for comparison with a standard PET blow molded object. Once a formulation(s) is identified that has the required combination of melt strength and physical properties, blow molding operations will be conducted on commercial-scale blow molding equipment. Metabolix has worked with several plastics converters with commercial blow molding equipment available for testing these formulations. Once commercial scale objects have been blow molded, the physical properties will be measured and mapped, then compared with PET blow molded items to ensure equivalent product characteristics. The final task will be to optimize the blow molding formulation to increase blow molding production to that obtained by commercial resins. The work proposed in this project will use PHA polymer produced by Metabolix's microbial fermentation process. This material, estimated to be approximately 5000 lbs, will be provided by the Metabolix-ADM commercial production facility scheduled to begin operation in late-2009.
						




Progress 09/01/09 to 08/31/10OutputsOUTPUTS: 1. Bottle wall thickness and weight measurements showed that branched P5001 control sample consistently gave maximum wall thickness and bottle weight while P1004 the minimum. All the rest of samples with various weight blending ratios resulted in wall thickness and bottle weight sat between results of these two control samples. 2. Under the same mold temperature and blow/injection pressure, the differences of wall thickness and weight were narrowed down as extrusion barrel temperature profile was lowered due to reduce melt flow rate. 3. Statistical analysis of various blends of P1004/P5001 and P1004/F3002 showed a consistent trend that increasing the non-branched low melt strength P1004 content reduces bottle wall thickness and weight. Similar trend was observed with P3002/P5001 blends but to a lesser extent. 4. Drop water bottle impact test showed that P5001 has the best impact strength due to its low glass transition temperature, lower shear melt viscosity, and high melt strength due to branching. The negative effect of using stand-alone P5001 compound for blow molding is the resulted lower bottle rigidity, which can be improved through the blending with P1004 or F3002. 5. The processing window of non-branched P1004 is inherently narrow due to low melt strength and high melt viscosity, and can only produce good quality bottles with uniform wall thickness under higher processing temperature. At a loading level of 25~75%, P5001 helps to improve melt flow and increases impact strength of blow molded P1004 bottles under optimal processing conditions. This approach of blending branched and non-branched PHA compounds enables us to control melt rheology of the blended compounds to strike a balance between bottle rigidity and impact strength in the finished bottle products. PARTICIPANTS: Nothing significant to report during this reporting period. TARGET AUDIENCES: Not relevant to this project. PROJECT MODIFICATIONS: Metabolix requested and received a six month no cost extension to map out the process property performance window of the post fabrication annealing step. This study will determine best annealing conditions for improved properties, and a commercially viable annealing system will be set up to demonstrate performance. In addition, a processing guide to assist converters with blow mold operations using our PHA formulation will be developed.ImpactsWith the assistance from CSU and UML in providing extrusion blow molding equipments, man power, and technical support to conduct detailed experimentation and testing on different PHA compounds, we were able to successfully produce extrusion blow molded bottle samples with good processing characteristics, impact strength, rigidity, and aesthetics. The optimal PHA formulations and processing conditions were identified in the current study and ready for the future scale-up trials to verify their performance in the field.PublicationsNo publications reported this period

History[edit]
Founded in 1992 with the help of a licensing agreement with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[3] Metabolix, Inc. is a bioscience company with headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Metabolix provides sustainable solutions to the plastic, chemical and energy industries. Oliver Peoples, Ph.D., and Anthony Sinskey, Ph.D., co-founded Metabolix after work at the (MIT) that identified the elementary methods and means for engineering polyhydroxyalkanoates out of plants and bacteria, thus making them biodegradable.[5]
In April, 2012, Metabolix opened its first international office in Cologne, Germany. The office is strategically located in the BioCampus Cologne life science park, which has been one of Germany’s largest biotechnology parks since 2002.[4] This office was opened to handle business development, customer service, and technical support to Metabolix’s European business partners and biopolymer customers.
Current Work[edit]
Metabolix, Inc. is developing and commercializing high-performance PHA biopolymers for performance additives, film and bag applications, and functional biodegradation. Metabolix’s technology platforms are creating sustainable solutions in the world of plastics, chemicals and energy.[1] The company is also in the process of developing platforms to co-produce plastics, chemicals, and energy from crops [6]
Awards[edit]
Metabolix has been recognized for its research, development and product innovations through a series of prestigious awards and grants including: the “Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award” (2005),[7] the "New Technologies in Renewable Materials and Processes Award” (2006),[8] the “Technology Pioneer Award” (2010),[9] and the Museum of Science Boston’s “Invented Here!” award (2011).[10]
Products[edit]
Biopolymers[edit]
Metabolix performance PHA biopolymers are produced in microorganisms, and are therefore biodegradable by similar organisms present in environments such as soil and water.[11]
Mirel[edit]
Mirel soil and marine biodegradable polymers help to reduce plastic waste accumulation in the environment. Mirel is a product of corn sugar fermentation with proprietary genetically engineered bacteria.
In July 2007, Metabolix released a 100% biodegradable gift card product for Target. If put into a home composting area, the card would completely biodegrade in about 40 days.[12][13]
In 2010, Metabolix began work with Ball Horticultural to create SoilWraps using Mirel.[14] SoilWraps are bottomless biodegradable flower pots that can be planted directly in a home garden.[15]
Mvera[edit]
Metabolix has designed the Mvera product line for applications including compost bags and can liners used for organic waste, as well as shopping and retail bags that can be reused as compostable organic waste bags. In 2013, Metabolix launched Mvera B5010 and B5011, which are certified compostable by Vinçotte to meet the EN 13432 standard for compostable plastics. [16] [17] These compostable film resins are designed for blown/cast film processing with both opaque (B5010) and transparent (B5011) performance, and exhibit many of the same performance qualities of petroleum-based resins.[18]
In October 2011, Andolfi & C., an Italian films, packaging, and bags company, began using Mvera for a line of compostable plastic bags.[19]
Performance Additives[edit]
Metabolix is developing performance additives for a range of plastics in both the traditional and biobased markets. Metabolix has found PHA brings a number of performance benefits to plastics including PLA and PVC. Recently, they have announced a new grade designed specifically to modify PLA.[20] In this application, PHA acts as a flexibilizer and impact modifier.
PHA Latex[edit]
Metabolix recently announced that it is developing a new grade of PHA latex for paper coatings. [21]
Biobased Chemicals[edit]
Metabolix is working to create biochemicals that work as high-performance replacements for petroleum-based products, with focus on C3 and C4 chemicals.[22]
Biobased GBL/BDO[edit]
Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and butanediol (BDO) are industrial chemicals produced from hydrocarbons: natural gas, oil, and other fossil-based sources. Metabolix has developed a system for producing renewable GBL using a proprietary FAST system. The GBL can then be converted to BDO via a catalytic process.[22]
Biobased Acrylic Acid[edit]
Metabolix is developing techniques to produce sustainable biobased acrylic acid. The company is currently developing the FAST process for recovering acrylic acid.[23]
Crop Technologies[edit]
The centerpiece of the Metabolix’s plant technology is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the simplest member of the broad polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family of biopolymers. They have worked with switchgrass, camelina, sugarcane, as well as tobacco.[24]
In 2009, Metabolix completed a field trial producing PHA in a tobacco crop.[25]
In 2012, Metabolix secured an ARPA-E grant to improve productivity of biofuel production in plants, specifically camelina.[26]
In 2011, Metabolix was awarded a $6.0 million grant to produce PHB in switchgrass and to develop methods to thermally convert the PHB-containing switchgrass to crotonic acid and a higher density residual biomass fraction for production of biofuel.[27]
Joint Venture[edit]
In 2006, Metabolix and Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) announced a strategic alliance to manufacture and commercialize high-performance natural plastics.[28]
On January 13, 2012 ADM announced that it was terminating the joint venture. Metabolix's stock plunged 56% to $2.64 immediately following this announcement,[29] leading to a class action suit.
Lawsuit[edit]
Following the collapse of the Telles joint venture, shareholders of Metabolix filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that executives knowingly misled them about the viability of the production process of Mirel. The case, Coyne et al v. Metabolix, Inc., was filed on February 17, 2012 in Boston's federal court, citing Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. It names executives Eno and Hill in addition to Metabolix.[30][31] On September 20, 2013, the court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.[32]

In 2013, Metabolix launched Mvera B5010 and B5011, which are certified compostable by Vinçotte to meet the EN 13432 standard for compostable plastics. [16] [17] These compostable film resins are designed for blown/cast film processing with both opaque (B5010) and transparent (B5011) performance, and exhibit many of the same performance qualities of petroleum-based resins.[18]
In October 2011, Andolfi & C., an Italian films, packaging, and bags company, began using Mvera for a line of compostable plastic bags.[19]
Performance Additives[edit]
Metabolix is developing performance additives for a range of plastics in both the traditional and biobased markets. Metabolix has found PHA brings a number of performance benefits to plastics including PLA and PVC. Recently, they have announced a new grade designed specifically to modify PLA.[20] In this application, PHA acts as a flexibilizer and impact modifier.
PHA Latex[edit]
Metabolix recently announced that it is developing a new grade of PHA latex for paper coatings. [21]
Biobased Chemicals[edit]
Metabolix is working to create biochemicals that work as high-performance replacements for petroleum-based products, with focus on C3 and C4 chemicals.[22]
Biobased GBL/BDO[edit]
Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and butanediol (BDO) are industrial chemicals produced from hydrocarbons: natural gas, oil, and other fossil-based sources. Metabolix has developed a system for producing renewable GBL using a proprietary FAST system. The GBL can then be converted to BDO via a catalytic process.[22]
Biobased Acrylic Acid[edit]
Metabolix is developing techniques to produce sustainable biobased acrylic acid. The company is currently developing the FAST process for recovering acrylic acid.[23]
Crop Technologies[edit]
The centerpiece of the Metabolix’s plant technology is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the simplest member of the broad polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family of biopolymers. They have worked with switchgrass, camelina, sugarcane, as well as tobacco.[24]
In 2009, Metabolix completed a field trial producing PHA in a tobacco crop.[25]
In 2012, Metabolix secured an ARPA-E grant to improve productivity of biofuel production in plants, specifically camelina.[26]
In 2011, Metabolix was awarded a $6.0 million grant to produce PHB in switchgrass and to develop methods to thermally convert the PHB-containing switchgrass to crotonic acid and a higher density residual biomass fraction for production of biofuel.[27]
Joint Venture[edit]
In 2006, Metabolix and Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) announced a strategic alliance to manufacture and commercialize high-performance natural plastics.[28]
On January 13, 2012 ADM announced that it was terminating the joint venture. Metabolix's stock plunged 56% to $2.64 immediately following this announcement,[29] leading to a class action suit.
Lawsuit[edit]
Following the collapse of the Telles joint venture, shareholders of Metabolix filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that executives knowingly misled them about the viability of the production process of Mirel. The case, Coyne et al v. Metabolix, Inc., was filed on February 17, 2012 in Boston's federal court, citing Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. It names executives Eno and Hill in addition to Metabolix.[30][31] On September 20, 2013, the court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.[32]

History[edit]
Founded in 1992 with the help of a licensing agreement with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[3] Metabolix, Inc. is a bioscience company with headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Metabolix provides sustainable solutions to the plastic, chemical and energy industries. Oliver Peoples, Ph.D., and Anthony Sinskey, Ph.D., co-founded Metabolix after work at the (MIT) that identified the elementary methods and means for engineering polyhydroxyalkanoates out of plants and bacteria, thus making them biodegradable.[5]
In April, 2012, Metabolix opened its first international office in Cologne, Germany. The office is strategically located in the BioCampus Cologne life science park, which has been one of Germany’s largest biotechnology parks since 2002.[4] This office was opened to handle business development, customer service, and technical support to Metabolix’s European business partners and biopolymer customers.
Current Work[edit]
Metabolix, Inc. is developing and commercializing high-performance PHA biopolymers for performance additives, film and bag applications, and functional biodegradation. Metabolix’s technology platforms are creating sustainable solutions in the world of plastics, chemicals and energy.[1] The company is also in the process of developing platforms to co-produce plastics, chemicals, and energy from crops [6]
Awards[edit]
Metabolix has been recognized for its research, development and product innovations through a series of prestigious awards and grants including: the “Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award” (2005),[7] the "New Technologies in Renewable Materials and Processes Award” (2006),[8] the “Technology Pioneer Award” (2010),[9] and the Museum of Science Boston’s “Invented Here!” award (2011).[10]
Products[edit]
Biopolymers[edit]
Metabolix performance PHA biopolymers are produced in microorganisms, and are therefore biodegradable by similar organisms present in environments such as soil and water.[11]
Mirel[edit]
Mirel soil and marine biodegradable polymers help to reduce plastic waste accumulation in the environment. Mirel is a product of corn sugar fermentation with proprietary genetically engineered bacteria.
In July 2007, Metabolix released a 100% biodegradable gift card product for Target. If put into a home composting area, the card would completely biodegrade in about 40 days.[12][13]
In 2010, Metabolix began work with Ball Horticultural to create SoilWraps using Mirel.[14] SoilWraps are bottomless biodegradable flower pots that can be planted directly in a home garden.[15]
Mvera[edit]
Metabolix has designed the Mvera product line for applications including compost bags and can liners used for organic waste, as well as shopping and retail bags that can be reused as compostable organic waste bags. In 2013, Metabolix launched Mvera B5010 and B5011, which are certified compostable by Vinçotte to meet the EN 13432 standard for compostable plastics. [16] [17] These compostable film resins are designed for blown/cast film processing with both opaque (B5010) and transparent (B5011) performance, and exhibit many of the same performance qualities of petroleum-based resins.[18]
In October 2011, Andolfi & C., an Italian films, packaging, and bags company, began using Mvera for a line of compostable plastic bags.[19]
Performance Additives[edit]
Metabolix is developing performance additives for a range of plastics in both the traditional and biobased markets. Metabolix has found PHA brings a number of performance benefits to plastics including PLA and PVC. Recently, they have announced a new grade designed specifically to modify PLA.[20] In this application, PHA acts as a flexibilizer and impact modifier.
PHA Latex[edit]
Metabolix recently announced that it is developing a new grade of PHA latex for paper coatings. [21]
Biobased Chemicals[edit]
Metabolix is working to create biochemicals that work as high-performance replacements for petroleum-based products, with focus on C3 and C4 chemicals.[22]
Biobased GBL/BDO[edit]
Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and butanediol (BDO) are industrial chemicals produced from hydrocarbons: natural gas, oil, and other fossil-based sources. Metabolix has developed a system for producing renewable GBL using a proprietary FAST system. The GBL can then be converted to BDO via a catalytic process.[22]
Biobased Acrylic Acid[edit]
Metabolix is developing techniques to produce sustainable biobased acrylic acid. The company is currently developing the FAST process for recovering acrylic acid.[23]
Crop Technologies[edit]
The centerpiece of the Metabolix’s plant technology is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the simplest member of the broad polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family of biopolymers. They have worked with switchgrass, camelina, sugarcane, as well as tobacco.[24]
In 2009, Metabolix completed a field trial producing PHA in a tobacco crop.[25]
In 2012, Metabolix secured an ARPA-E grant to improve productivity of biofuel production in plants, specifically camelina.[26]
In 2011, Metabolix was awarded a $6.0 million grant to produce PHB in switchgrass and to develop methods to thermally convert the PHB-containing switchgrass to crotonic acid and a higher density residual biomass fraction for production of biofuel.[27]
Joint Venture[edit]
In 2006, Metabolix and Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) announced a strategic alliance to manufacture and commercialize high-performance natural plastics.[28]
On January 13, 2012 ADM announced that it was terminating the joint venture. Metabolix's stock plunged 56% to $2.64 immediately following this announcement,[29] leading to a class action suit.
Lawsuit[edit]
Following the collapse of the Telles joint venture, shareholders of Metabolix filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that executives knowingly misled them about the viability of the production process of Mirel. The case, Coyne et al v. Metabolix, Inc., was filed on February 17, 2012 in Boston's federal court, citing Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. It names executives Eno and Hill in addition to Metabolix.[30][31] On September 20, 2013, the court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.[32]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
