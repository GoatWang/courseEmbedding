Over-the-top content (OTT) is a term used in broadcasting and technology business reporting to refer to audio, video, and other media transmitted via the Internet as a standalone product, that is, without an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems (so-called multiple-system operators) controlling or distributing the content.[not verified in body]

Definitions[edit]





This section needs expansion with: definitions of the OTT term, from published sources, in relation to the FCC defined categories. You can help by adding to it. (December 2016)


In their 2008 book, Introduction to Video Search Engines, David C. Gibbon and Zhu Liu of AT&T Labs contrast an "over-the-top" method for the distribution of video on demand with video-delivery systems offered by cable and IPTV. Cable and IPTV represent tightly managed networks where channels can be changed instantly, while OTT download managers such as iTunes require that the video be downloaded first and then played.[1] Also in 2008, the blogger Jose Miguel Consado likewise contrasted IPTV telcos and cable operators with over-the-top players such as Apple TV, Amazon Unbox or Netflix which offer movie downloads.[2] The same year, an unnamed author writing for TMCNet stated that OTT content "removes service providers from the value chain," and rides for free on their infrastructure.[3]
In 2011, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission stated that it "considers that Internet access to programming independent of a facility or network dedicated to its delivery (via, for example, cable or satellite) is the defining feature of what have been termed 'over-the-top' services." [4]
The FCC, in its 17th Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming in 2014 (published May 2016), on developments in the video marketplace in that year, categorizes the entities providing the services into three groups:

multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs);
broadcast television stations; and
online video distributors (OVDs).[5]

MVPDs are defined by the FCC "based on the similarity of the video services offered," as any entity "such as, but not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint distribution service, a direct broadcast satellite service, or a television receive-only satellite program distributor, who makes available for purchase, by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video programming," citing Section 602(13) of the Act, and 47 U.S.C. § 522(13).[5]:4477f The FCC notes that as of this May 2016 report date, "[t]he major MVPDs offer hundreds of linear television channels [channels that "offer video programs on a specific channel at a specific time of day"], thousands of non-linear video-on-demand (VOD) programs [that "allow consumers to select and watch video programs whenever they request them], as well as pay-per-view (PPV) programs [whether VOD and pre-scheduled special events]."[5]:4477f The matter of the means used to distribute the programming is complicated, and is a matter of a pending FCC rule chance.[6]
An OVD is defined by the FCC as:

any entity that provides video programming by means of the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP)-based transmission path where the transmission path is provided by a person other than the OVD. An OVD does not include an MVPD inside its MVPD footprint or an MVPD to the extent it is offering online video programming as a component of an MVPD subscription to customers whose homes are inside its MVPD footprint.
The FCC does not define the term OTT content.[5][better source needed]

Background[edit]
In broadcasting, over-the-top content (OTT) is the audio, video, and other media content delivered over the Internet without the involvement of a multiple-system operator (MSO) in the control or distribution of the content. The Internet provider may be aware of the contents of the Internet Protocol (IP) packets but is not responsible for, nor able to control, the viewing abilities, copyrights, and/or other redistribution of the content. This model contrasts with the purchasing or rental of video or audio content from an Internet service provider (ISP), such as pay television,[citation needed] video on demand,[citation needed] and from internet protocol television (IPTV).[citation needed][7] OTT refers to content from a third party that is delivered to an end-user, with the ISP simply transporting IP packets.[8][9][10][11]
Types of content[edit]





This section needs expansion with: a thorough, sourced description of the types of OTT content current transmitted. You can help by adding to it. (December 2016)


OTT messaging is defined as instant messaging services provided by third parties, as an alternative to text messaging services provided by a mobile network operator.[12][13] An example is the Facebook-owned mobile application WhatsApp, that serves to replace text messaging on Internet connected smartphones.[14][15] Other providers of OTT messaging include Viber, WeChat, Skype, and Google Allo. [16]
OTT voice calling capabilities, for instance, as provided by Skype, WeChat, Viber, and WhatsApp use open internet communication protocols to replace and sometimes enhance existing operator controlled services offered by mobile phone operators.[citation needed]
Modes of access[edit]
Consumers can access OTT content through Internet-connected devices such as phones (including Android, iPhone, and Windows-type mobile devices),[citation needed] smart TVs (such as Google TV and LG Electronic's Channel Plus),[17][better source needed] set-top boxes (such as the Fire TV and Roku),[citation needed] gaming consoles (such as the PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox One),[citation needed] and desktop and laptop computers and tablets.[citation needed]

This article needs attention from an expert in Technology, Media or Computing. The specific problem is: that the article currently conjectures but does not source the relationship between the FCC-defined OVD and the title OTT, otherwise fails to adequately and accurately report the content of it sources, or to connect sources with content, sentence by sentence. See the talk page for details. WikiProject Technology, WikiProject Media or WikiProject Computing may be able to help recruit an expert. (December 2016)







This article's lead section may not adequately summarize its contents.

Over-the-top content (OTT) is a term used in broadcasting and technology business reporting to refer to audio, video, and other media transmitted via the Internet as a standalone product, that is, without an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems (so-called multiple-system operators) controlling or distributing the content.[not verified in body]

Definitions[edit]





This section needs expansion with: definitions of the OTT term, from published sources, in relation to the FCC defined categories. You can help by adding to it. (December 2016)


In their 2008 book, Introduction to Video Search Engines, David C. Gibbon and Zhu Liu of AT&T Labs contrast an "over-the-top" method for the distribution of video on demand with video-delivery systems offered by cable and IPTV. Cable and IPTV represent tightly managed networks where channels can be changed instantly, while OTT download managers such as iTunes require that the video be downloaded first and then played.[1] Also in 2008, the blogger Jose Miguel Consado likewise contrasted IPTV telcos and cable operators with over-the-top players such as Apple TV, Amazon Unbox or Netflix which offer movie downloads.[2] The same year, an unnamed author writing for TMCNet stated that OTT content "removes service providers from the value chain," and rides for free on their infrastructure.[3]
In 2011, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission stated that it "considers that Internet access to programming independent of a facility or network dedicated to its delivery (via, for example, cable or satellite) is the defining feature of what have been termed 'over-the-top' services." [4]
The FCC, in its 17th Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming in 2014 (published May 2016), on developments in the video marketplace in that year, categorizes the entities providing the services into three groups:

multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs);
broadcast television stations; and
online video distributors (OVDs).[5]

MVPDs are defined by the FCC "based on the similarity of the video services offered," as any entity "such as, but not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint distribution service, a direct broadcast satellite service, or a television receive-only satellite program distributor, who makes available for purchase, by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video programming," citing Section 602(13) of the Act, and 47 U.S.C. § 522(13).[5]:4477f The FCC notes that as of this May 2016 report date, "[t]he major MVPDs offer hundreds of linear television channels [channels that "offer video programs on a specific channel at a specific time of day"], thousands of non-linear video-on-demand (VOD) programs [that "allow consumers to select and watch video programs whenever they request them], as well as pay-per-view (PPV) programs [whether VOD and pre-scheduled special events]."[5]:4477f The matter of the means used to distribute the programming is complicated, and is a matter of a pending FCC rule chance.[6]
An OVD is defined by the FCC as:

any entity that provides video programming by means of the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP)-based transmission path where the transmission path is provided by a person other than the OVD. An OVD does not include an MVPD inside its MVPD footprint or an MVPD to the extent it is offering online video programming as a component of an MVPD subscription to customers whose homes are inside its MVPD footprint.
The FCC does not define the term OTT content.[5][better source needed]

Background[edit]
In broadcasting, over-the-top content (OTT) is the audio, video, and other media content delivered over the Internet without the involvement of a multiple-system operator (MSO) in the control or distribution of the content. The Internet provider may be aware of the contents of the Internet Protocol (IP) packets but is not responsible for, nor able to control, the viewing abilities, copyrights, and/or other redistribution of the content. This model contrasts with the purchasing or rental of video or audio content from an Internet service provider (ISP), such as pay television,[citation needed] video on demand,[citation needed] and from internet protocol television (IPTV).[citation needed][7] OTT refers to content from a third party that is delivered to an end-user, with the ISP simply transporting IP packets.[8][9][10][11]
Types of content[edit]





This section needs expansion with: a thorough, sourced description of the types of OTT content current transmitted. You can help by adding to it. (December 2016)


OTT messaging is defined as instant messaging services provided by third parties, as an alternative to text messaging services provided by a mobile network operator.[12][13] An example is the Facebook-owned mobile application WhatsApp, that serves to replace text messaging on Internet connected smartphones.[14][15] Other providers of OTT messaging include Viber, WeChat, Skype, and Google Allo. [16]
OTT voice calling capabilities, for instance, as provided by Skype, WeChat, Viber, and WhatsApp use open internet communication protocols to replace and sometimes enhance existing operator controlled services offered by mobile phone operators.[citation needed]
Modes of access[edit]
Consumers can access OTT content through Internet-connected devices such as phones (including Android, iPhone, and Windows-type mobile devices),[citation needed] smart TVs (such as Google TV and LG Electronic's Channel Plus),[17][better source needed] set-top boxes (such as the Fire TV and Roku),[citation needed] gaming consoles (such as the PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox One),[citation needed] and desktop and laptop computers and tablets.[citation needed]

This article needs attention from an expert in Technology, Media or Computing. The specific problem is: that the article currently conjectures but does not source the relationship between the FCC-defined OVD and the title OTT, otherwise fails to adequately and accurately report the content of it sources, or to connect sources with content, sentence by sentence. See the talk page for details. WikiProject Technology, WikiProject Media or WikiProject Computing may be able to help recruit an expert. (December 2016)







This article's lead section may not adequately summarize its contents. To comply with Wikipedia's lead section guidelines, please consider modifying the lead to provide an accessible overview of the article's key points in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article. (discuss). (December 2016)


Over-the-top content (OTT) is a term used in broadcasting and technology business reporting to refer to audio, video, and other media transmitted via the Internet as a standalone product, that is, without an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems (so-called multiple-system operators) controlling or distributing the content.[not verified in body]

Definitions[edit]





This section needs expansion with: definitions of the OTT term, from published sources, in relation to the FCC defined categories. You can help by adding to it. (December 2016)


In their 2008 book, Introduction to Video Search Engines, David C. Gibbon and Zhu Liu of AT&T Labs contrast an "over-the-top" method for the distribution of video on demand with video-delivery systems offered by cable and IPTV. Cable and IPTV represent tightly managed networks where channels can be changed instantly, while OTT download managers such as iTunes require that the video be downloaded first and then played.[1] Also in 2008, the blogger Jose Miguel Consado likewise contrasted IPTV telcos and cable operators with over-the-top players such as Apple TV, Amazon Unbox or Netflix which offer movie downloads.[2] The same year, an unnamed author writing for TMCNet stated that OTT content "removes service providers from the value chain," and rides for free on their infrastructure.[3]
In 2011, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission stated that it "considers that Internet access to programming independent of a facility or network dedicated to its delivery (via, for example, cable or satellite) is the defining feature of what have been termed 'over-the-top' services." [4]
The FCC, in its 17th Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming in 2014 (published May 2016), on developments in the video marketplace in that year, categorizes the entities providing the services into three groups:

multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs);
broadcast television stations; and
online video distributors (OVDs).[5]

MVPDs are defined by the FCC "based on the similarity of the video services offered," as any entity "such as, but not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint distribution service, a direct broadcast satellite service, or a television receive-only satellite program distributor, who makes available for purchase, by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video programming," citing Section 602(13) of the Act, and 47 U.S.C. § 522(13).[5]:4477f The FCC notes that as of this May 2016 report date, "[t]he major MVPDs offer hundreds of linear television channels [channels that "offer video programs on a specific channel at a specific time of day"], thousands of non-linear video-on-demand (VOD) programs [that "allow consumers to select and watch video programs whenever they request them], as well as pay-per-view (PPV) programs [whether VOD and pre-scheduled special events]."[5]:4477f The matter of the means used to distribute the programming is complicated, and is a matter of a pending FCC rule chance.[6]
An OVD is defined by the FCC as:

any entity that provides video programming by means of the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP)-based transmission path where the transmission path is provided by a person other than the OVD. An OVD does not include an MVPD inside its MVPD footprint or an MVPD to the extent it is offering online video programming as a component of an MVPD subscription to customers whose homes are inside its MVPD footprint.
The FCC does not define the term OTT content.[5][better source needed]

Background[edit]
In broadcasting, over-the-top content (OTT) is the audio, video, and other media content delivered over the Internet without the involvement of a multiple-system operator (MSO) in the control or distribution of the content. The Internet provider may be aware of the contents of the Internet Protocol (IP) packets but is not responsible for, nor able to control, the viewing abilities, copyrights, and/or other redistribution of the content. This model contrasts with the purchasing or rental of video or audio content from an Internet service provider (ISP), such as pay television,[citation needed] video on demand,[citation needed] and from internet protocol television (IPTV).[citation needed][7] OTT refers to content from a third party that is delivered to an end-user, with the ISP simply transporting IP packets.[8][9][10][11]
Types of content[edit]





This section needs expansion with: a thorough, sourced description of the types of OTT content current transmitted. You can help by adding to it. (December 2016)


OTT messaging is defined as instant messaging services provided by third parties, as an alternative to text messaging services provided by a mobile network operator.[12][13] An example is the Facebook-owned mobile application WhatsApp, that serves to replace text messaging on Internet connected smartphones.[14][15] Other providers of OTT messaging include Viber, WeChat, Skype, and Google Allo. [16]
OTT voice calling capabilities, for instance, as provided by Skype, WeChat, Viber, and WhatsApp use open internet communication protocols to replace and sometimes enhance existing operator controlled services offered by mobile phone operators.[citation needed]
Modes of access[edit]
Consumers can access OTT content through Internet-connected devices such as phones (including Android, iPhone, and Windows-type mobile devices),[citation needed] smart TVs (such as Google TV and LG Electronic's Channel Plus),[17][better source needed] set-top boxes (such as the Fire TV and Roku),[citation needed] gaming consoles (such as the PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox One),[citation needed] and desktop and laptop computers and tablets.[citation needed]

Dave Ott, Territory Manager
Dave Ott installs furniture, makes deliveries, and is both a salesperson and single parent. Though much of his work history focused on the internal side of organizations (warehouse management and operations), he is an extremely talented salesperson, having received expert training in the art of negotiation from his daughter.
Dave loves the challenge of his professional career, but his higher aspiration is to be “father extraordinaire” in the eyes of his daughter. His favorite quote is from none other than Dr. Seuss: “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind.”
Dave joined EZ Office Products after working nearly twenty years assembling and installing office furniture along with his warehouse and operations background. He’s the in-house expert when it comes to floor plan reconfiguration for clients. After so many years of hands-on experience, we’ve dubbed Dave our “go-to-guy.”

Ott, Viking Global Investors LP, Viking Global Partners LLC, Viking Global Performance LLC, and Viking Global Founders, LLC  Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP              USA October 22 2008   C.A. No. 1884-VCL (Del. Ch. October 22, 2008) Brian T. Olson (the “Plaintiff”), together with O. Andreas Halvorsen and David C. Ott (jointly, the “Defendants”) formed a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company”) in 1999. No shortform limited liability company agreement was ever prepared or executed, but a draft amended and restated limited liability company agreement was prepared but was never executed. The unsigned document provided for a multi-year earnout of a founder’s interest in the Company if he voluntarily or involuntarily left the Company. Upon returning from a sabbatical, the Defendants informed the Plaintiff that they had determined to remove him from his position with the Company. The two Defendants paid the Plaintiff the amount representing his capital account balance and the remainder of his annual salary, but did not pay him an earnout because they claimed that they had never agreed to do so. The Plaintiff sought a series of six yearly payments he claimed he was entitled to under the unsigned agreement. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The Court’s opinion focused purely on the legal questions of whether the statute of frauds applies to LLC agreements. In this case of first impression, the court found that the statute of frauds does apply to LLC agreements, and that the exceptions to that doctrine that the Plaintiff argued were not available under the facts of the case. Summary judgment was ordered for the Defendants. The Delaware LLC statute expressly allows oral operating agreements, but does not address whether the statute of frauds applies to such agreements. The court held that the statute of frauds applies to LLC agreements, noting that while few oral operating agreements will have provisions that will not be able to be performed within a year, those provisions that cannot possibly be performed within one year are unenforceable. Provisions that may possibly be performed within one year do not fall within the statute of frauds and remain enforceable. In the case at hand, notwithstanding that the obligation to make a payment under the earnout provision could occur within one year, existing case law suggested that unless nothing remained to be done after one year other than the payment of money, the statute of frauds applied. Here, the agreement would have required the Defendants to maintain the Plaintiff’s economic interest in the company and to refrain from any actions that would reduce his economic interest for a period of time well beyond one year, and even if the Plaintiff were to die, the benefits would continue to the Plaintiff’s estate or successor-in-interest. No exceptions to the statute of fraud were applicable. Although multiple other writings existed to other entities formed at the same time as the Company, none of them mentioned the unsigned agreement or its earnout provision. One document made reference to the Company’s “limited liability company agreement…as amended from time to time,” that document did not clearly identify the unsigned agreement as the “limited liability company agreement” to which it was referring. Likewise, the past performance exception to the statute of frauds was inapplicable because that exception also requires the ability to perform the contract within one year. The full opinion is available here.
