Notes, together with the Indenture Trustee’s certificate of
authentication, shall be in substantially the form set forth as
Exhibit A hereto, with such appropriate insertions,
omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or
permitted by this Indenture and may have such letters, numbers or
other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements
placed thereon as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the
officers executing such Notes, as evidenced by their execution of
such Notes. Any portion of the text of any Note may be set forth on
the reverse thereof, with an appropriate reference thereto on the
face of such Note.

The terms of the Notes set forth in
Exhibit A hereto are part of the terms of this
Indenture.

SECTION 2.02 Execution,
Authentication and Delivery . The Notes shall be executed by
the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity. The signature of
any authorized officer of the Owner Trustee on the Notes may be
manual or by facsimile. Notes bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of individuals who were at any time authorized officers
of the Owner Trustee shall bind the Issuing Entity, notwithstanding
that any such individuals have ceased to hold such offices prior to
the authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold such
offices at the date of such Notes.

The Indenture Trustee shall, upon
receipt of an Issuing Entity Order, authenticate and deliver for
original issue the following aggregate principal amounts of the
Notes: (i) $120,000,000 of Class A-1 Notes,

(iii) $160,000,000 of Class A-2b Notes,
(iv) $388,000,000 of Class A-3 Notes, and

principal amount of Class A-1 Notes, Class A-2 Notes,
Class A-3 Notes and Class A-4 Notes outstanding at any
time may not exceed such respective amounts, except as provided in
Section 2.05 .

Each Note shall be dated the date of
its authentication. The Notes shall be issuable as registered notes
in book-entry form in minimum denominations of $25,000 and in
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; provided ,
that the Retained Notes, if any, shall be issued as Definitive
Notes and the holder of such Retained Notes shall be a Note Owner
and a Noteholder for all purposes of this Indenture.

No Note may be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred to any Person except in accordance with
Section 2.04 and any attempted sale, pledge or transfer

No Note shall be entitled to any

purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein

its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Note
shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

may execute, on behalf of the Issuing Entity, and upon receipt of
an Issuing Entity Order, the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, temporary Notes that are printed, lithographed,
typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, substantially of
the tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued

Indenture as the officers executing such Notes may determine, as
evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

Noteholder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Notes, the Owner Trustee shall execute, on behalf of the
Issuing Entity, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver in exchange therefor, a like principal amount of Definitive
Notes of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, such
temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Notes.

SECTION 2.04 Registration;
Registration of Transfer and Exchange .

(a) The Issuing Entity shall cause
to be kept a register (the “ Note Register ”) in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
the Issuing Entity shall provide for the registration of Notes and
the registration of transfers of Notes by the Note Registrar. The
Indenture Trustee is hereby initially appointed the “ Note
Registrar ” for the purpose of registering Notes and
transfers of Notes as herein provided. In the event, subsequent to
the Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee notifies the Issuing Entity
that it is unable to act as Note Registrar, the Issuing Entity
shall appoint another bank or trust company, having an office
located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, agreeing
to act in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture
applicable to it, and otherwise acceptable to the Indenture
Trustee, to act as successor Note Registrar under this Indenture.
Upon any resignation of any Note Registrar, the Issuing Entity
shall promptly appoint a successor or, if it elects not to make
such an appointment, assume the duties of Note
Registrar.

If a Person other than the Indenture
Trustee is appointed by the Issuing Entity as Note Registrar, the
Issuing Entity shall give the Indenture Trustee prompt written
notice of such appointment and the location, and any change in such
location, of the Note Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall
have the right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable times
and to obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture Trustee shall have
the right to rely upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note
Registrar by an Executive Officer as to the names and addresses of
the Noteholders and the principal amounts and number of such
Notes.

(b) Upon the proper surrender for
registration of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the
Issuing Entity to be maintained as provided in
Section 3.02 , if the requirements of
Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee shall
execute, on behalf of the Issuing Entity, and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and the related Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee, one or
more new Notes in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount.

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(c) At the option of the related
Noteholder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of such Notes at such office or agency. Whenever any
Notes are so surrendered for exchange, if the requirements of
Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee shall
execute, on behalf of the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee the Notes that the Noteholder making such
exchange is entitled to receive. Every Note presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so
required by the Issuing Entity or the Indenture Trustee) be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Entity and the
Indenture Trustee, including appropriate tax documentation, duly
executed by the Noteholder thereof or its attorney-in-fact duly
authorized in writing.

(d) All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuing Entity, evidencing the same debt and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

(e) No service charge shall be made
to a Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes, but the Issuing Entity may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection therewith, other than exchanges pursuant
to Sections 2.03 or 9.05 not involving any
transfer.

(f) By acquiring a Note (or interest
therein), each Noteholder (and if the Noteholder is a Plan, its
fiduciary or trustee) is deemed to represent and warrant that
either (i) such Noteholder is not acquiring the Note (or
interest therein) with the assets of a Plan or
(ii) (A) the Note is rated at least “investment
grade” by a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization at the time of acquisition and (B) the
acquisition and holding of the Note (or interest therein) will not,
in the case of a Benefit Plan Investor, give rise to a nonexempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a Plan that is
subject to Similar Law, result in a violation of any Similar Law.
Benefit Plan Investors and Plans that are subject to Similar Law
may not acquire the Notes (or interest therein) at any time that
the rating on such Notes is below “investment
grade.”

(g) The Tax Retained Notes, if any,
will not be transferred for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless
a written opinion of counsel, which counsel and opinion shall be
acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, is delivered to the Indenture
Trustee prior to and in connection with such transfer that either
(A) such Notes will be debt for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or (B) the transfer of such Notes will not cause
(i) the Issuing Entity to be treated as an association or
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation (ii) any
Outstanding Notes (other than any Tax Retained Notes) that were
characterized as debt at the time of their issuance (based upon an
opinion of a nationally recognized tax counsel) to be treated as
other than debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
(iii) an event in which gain or loss would be recognized by
any holder in respect of any Outstanding Notes (other than any Tax
Retained Notes) that were characterized as debt at the time of
their issuance (based upon an opinion of a nationally recognized
tax counsel). With respect to any transfer of the Tax Retained
Notes (other than to a Person specified in the definition of Tax
Retained Notes) for which no written opinion of counsel is provided
pursuant to the preceding sentence as described in clause (A), the
transfer of such Notes must be to a

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)






“United States person” as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code unless otherwise provided in a
written opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel. If there are
other Notes of the same Class as such transferred Notes which are
not Tax Retained Notes prior to such transfer, such transfer will
not be effective unless (i) the Tax Retained Notes are part of
the same issue (as described in United States Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1275-2(k)) as the other Notes from the same Class,
(ii) neither the Tax Retained Notes nor such other Notes from
the same Class will be treated as issued with original issue
discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (iii) the Tax
Retained Notes and such other Notes from the same Class can be
tracked in a manner that will allow each holder of any such Note to
identify the information described in United States Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1275-3(b)(1)(i) with respect to each such
Note.

The preceding provisions of this
Section notwithstanding, the Issuing Entity shall not be required
to make, and the Note Registrar need not register, transfers or
exchanges of any Note (i) selected for redemption, or
(ii) for a period of 15 days preceding the due date for any
payment with respect to such Note.

SECTION 2.05 Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes . If (i) any mutilated
Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture
Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction,
loss or theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the
Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by
it to hold the Issuing Entity, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Owner
Trustee, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee that such Note
has been acquired by a “protected purchaser” (as
contemplated by Article 8 of the UCC), and provided that the
requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, the Owner
Trustee shall execute, on behalf of the Issuing Entity, and upon
receipt of an Issuing Entity Request the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note;
provided , however , that if any such destroyed, lost
or stolen Note (but not a mutilated Note) shall have become or
within seven days shall become due and payable, or shall have been
called for redemption, instead of issuing a replacement Note, the
Issuing Entity may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so
due or payable or upon the Redemption Date without the surrender
thereof. If, after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment
of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the
preceding sentence, a “protected purchaser” (as
contemplated by Article 8 of the UCC) of the original Note in lieu
of which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment such
original Note, the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from
the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a “protected
purchaser” (as contemplated by Article 8 of the UCC), and
shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity
provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or
expense incurred by the Issuing Entity or the Indenture Trustee in
connection therewith.

Upon the issuance of any replacement
Note under this Section, the Issuing Entity or the Indenture
Trustee may require the payment by the related Noteholder of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee or the
Note Registrar) connected therewith.

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuing Entity, whether or
not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any
time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

SECTION 2.06 Persons Deemed
Owners . Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer
of any Note, the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee and their
respective agents shall treat the Person in whose name any Note is
registered (as of the date of determination) as the owner of such
Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and
interest, if any, on such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note is overdue, and none of the
Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee or any of their respective
agents shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 2.07 Cancellation .
All Notes surrendered for payment, registration of transfer,
exchange or redemption shall, if surrendered to any Person other
than the Indenture Trustee, be delivered to the Indenture Trustee
and shall be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee. The
Issuing Entity may at any time deliver to the Indenture Trustee for
cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered
hereunder that the Issuing Entity may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled
by the Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu
of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided in this
Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All
cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of by the Indenture Trustee
in accordance with its standard retention or disposal policy as in
effect at the time unless the Issuing Entity shall direct by an
Issuing Entity Order that they be destroyed or returned to it;
provided, that such Issuing Entity Order is timely and that such
Notes have not been previously disposed of by the Indenture
Trustee.

SECTION 2.08 Release of
Collateral . Subject to Section 11.01 and the terms
of the other Basic Documents, the Indenture Trustee shall release
property from the Lien of this Indenture only upon receipt of an
Issuing Entity Request, accompanied by (i) an Officer’s
Certificate, (ii) an Opinion of Counsel and (iii) unless
such release is in connection with a redemption of the Notes in
accordance with Section 10.01 , Independent
Certificates in accordance with TIA Sections 314(c) and 314(d)(1)
or an Opinion of Counsel in lieu of such Independent Certificates

SECTION 2.09 Book-Entry Notes
. Unless otherwise specified, the Notes, (other than the Retained
Notes, if any), upon original issuance, will be issued in the form
of one or more typewritten Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes,
to be delivered to the Indenture Trustee, as agent for DTC, the
initial Clearing Agency, or a custodian therefor, by, or on behalf
of, the Issuing Entity. For each Class of Book-Entry Notes, one
fully registered Note shall be issued with respect to each $500
million in principal amount of each Class of Notes or such lesser
amount as necessary. Such Notes shall initially be registered on
the Note Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee
of the initial Clearing Agency, and no Note Owner shall receive a
Definitive Note representing such Note Owner’s interest in
such Note (other than in the case of the Retained Notes, if any),
except as provided in Section 2.11 . Except with
respect to the Retained Notes, if any, and otherwise, unless and
until Definitive Notes have been issued to Note Owners pursuant to
Section 2.11 :

(a) the provisions of this Section
shall be in full force and effect;

(b) the Note Registrar and the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing
Agency for all purposes of this Indenture (including the payment of
principal of and interest on the Notes and the giving of
instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole Noteholder, and
shall have no obligation to Note Owners;

(c) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions of
this Indenture, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

(d) the rights of Note Owners shall
be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited
to those established by law and agreements between or among such
Note Owners and the Clearing Agency or Clearing Agency
Participants; pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to
Section 2.11 , the initial Clearing Agency will make
book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and
receive and transmit payments of principal of and interest on the
Notes to such Clearing Agency Participants; and

(e) whenever this Indenture requires
or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of Noteholders evidencing a specified percentage of the
Outstanding Amount, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to
represent such percentage only to the extent that it has received
instructions to such effect from Note Owners and/or Clearing Agency
Participants owning or representing, respectively, such required
percentage of the beneficial interest in the Notes and has
delivered such instructions to the Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 2.10 Notices to Clearing
Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication to
Noteholders is required under this Indenture, except with respect
to the Retained Notes, if any, and otherwise, unless and until

such notices and communications specified herein to be given to
Noteholders to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligation to
the Note Owners.

originally issued as Definitive Notes), if (i) (A) the
Depositor, the Owner Trustee or the Administrative Agent advises
the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no
longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities
as described in the Depository Agreement and (B) the
Depositor, the Indenture Trustee or the Administrative Agent is
unable to locate a qualified successor (and if the Administrative
Agent has made such determination, the Administrative Agent has
given written notice thereof to the Indenture Trustee),
(ii) the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee or the
Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by

applicable law, at its option advises the
Indenture Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or (iii) after
an Indenture Default, Note Owners representing in the aggregate not
less than 51% of the Outstanding Amount, voting as a single class,
advise the Indenture Trustee through the Clearing Agency and
Clearing Agency Participants in writing that the continuation of a
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or its successor is
no longer in the best interest of Note Owners, the Indenture
Trustee shall be required to notify all Note Owners, through the
Clearing Agency, of the occurrence of such event and the
availability through the Clearing Agency of Definitive Notes to
Note Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Indenture
Trustee by the Clearing Agency of the Note or Notes representing
the Book-Entry Notes and the receipt of instructions for
re-registration, the Indenture Trustee shall issue Definitive Notes
to Note Owners, who thereupon shall become Noteholders for all
purposes of this Indenture. None of the Issuing Entity, Owner
Trustee, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be
liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions.

The Indenture Trustee, the Issuing
Entity and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable if the
Indenture Trustee or the Administrative Agent is unable to locate a
qualified successor Clearing Agency. The Definitive Notes shall be
typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by any
combination of such methods (with or without steel engraved
borders), all as determined by the officers executing such Notes,
as evidenced by their execution of such Notes. From and after the
date of issuance of Definitive Notes, all notices to be given to
Noteholders shall be mailed to their addresses of record in the
Note Register as of the relevant Deposit Date. Such notices shall
be deemed to have been given as of the date of mailing.

If Definitive Notes are issued and
the Indenture Trustee is not the Note Registrar, the Issuing Entity
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee a
list of the names and addresses of the Noteholders (i) as of
each Deposit Date, within five days thereafter and (ii) as of
not more than ten days prior to the time such list is furnished,
within 30 days after receipt by the Owner Trustee of a written
request therefor.

SECTION 2.12 Authenticating
Agents . Upon the request of the Issuing Entity, the Indenture
Trustee shall, and if the Indenture Trustee so chooses the
Indenture Trustee may, appoint one or more Authenticating Agents
with power to act on its behalf and subject to its direction in the
authentication of Notes in connection with issuance, transfers and
exchanges under Sections 2.02 , 2.04 ,
2.05 and 9.05 , as fully to all intents and purposes
as though each such Authenticating Agent had been expressly
authorized by such Sections to authenticate such Notes. For all
purposes of this Indenture, the authentication of Notes by an
Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be
the authentication of Notes by the Indenture Trustee.

Any corporation into which any
Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall
be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust
business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of
such Authenticating Agent hereunder, without the execution or
filing of any further act on the part of the parties hereto or such
Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







Any Authenticating Agent may at any
time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the
Indenture Trustee and the Issuing Entity. The Indenture Trustee may
at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent
and the Issuing Entity. Upon receiving such notice of resignation
or upon such termination, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly
appoint a successor Authenticating Agent and shall give written
notice of such appointment to the Issuing Entity.

The Indenture Trustee agrees to pay
to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable
compensation for its services and reimbursement for its reasonable
expenses relating thereto, and the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to be reimbursed for all such payments, subject to
Section 6.07 . The provisions of
Sections 2.07 and 6.04 shall be applicable to
any Authenticating Agent.

SECTION 2.13 Tax Treatment .
The Issuing Entity has entered into this Indenture, and the Notes
(other than the Tax Retained Notes, if any), will be issued, with
the intention that, for U.S. federal, state and local income,
single business and franchise tax purposes, the Notes will qualify
as indebtedness. The Issuing Entity, by entering into this
Indenture, and each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note (and
each Note Owner by its acceptance of an interest in the applicable
Book-Entry Note), agrees to treat the Notes (other than the Tax
Retained Notes, if any), for U.S. federal, state and local income,
single business and franchise tax purposes as
indebtedness.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent the Issuer is treated as a partnership for federal,
state or local income or franchise purposes and a Noteholder (or a
Note Owner, as applicable) is treated as a partner in such
partnership, the Noteholders (and Note Owners, as applicable) agree
that any tax, penalty, interest or other obligation imposed under
the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the income tax items
arising from such partnership shall be the sole obligation of the
Noteholder (or Note Owner, as applicable) to whom such items are
allocated and not of such partnership.

SECTION 2.14 Tax Forms .
Promptly upon request, each Noteholder shall provide to the
Indenture Trustee, Paying Agent and/or the Issuing Entity (or other
person responsible for withholding of taxes) with the Tax
Information.

SECTION 2.15 Retained Notes
.

(a) No Retained Note has been or
will be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities or “blue sky” laws of any state or other
jurisdiction, and no Retained Note or any interest therein may be
resold, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act
or any other applicable Securities or “blue sky” laws,
pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in a transaction not subject
thereto.
 












 



10


 



(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(b) Each Retained Note will bear a
legend to the following effect:

THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND
MAY NOT BE RESOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR “BLUE
SKY” LAWS, PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM OR IN A
TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT THERETO.

(c) Prior to any sale or transfer of
any Tax Retained Note (or interest therein) that did not receive
the written opinion of counsel described in clause (A) of
Section 2.04(g), each prospective transferee of such Tax
Retained Note (or interest therein) (except for transfers to a
Person specified in the definition of Tax Retained Notes) shall
provide a written representation letter to the Depositor and
Indenture Trustee in a form that substantially provides the
representations set forth in this Section 2.15(c) and will
hereby be deemed to have represented and agreed as
follows:

(i) The interests in the Tax
Retained Notes and any interests in the Issuing Entity treated as
equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes together may at no time
be held by more than 95 Persons. No transfer of Tax Retained Notes
(or any interest therein) will be permitted to the extent that such
transfer would cause the number of direct or indirect holders of an
interest in the Tax Retained Notes and any interests in the Issuing
Entity treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes to
exceed a number equal to 95 Persons and any such transfers shall be
void ab initio. The Depositor shall have the duty and obligation to
ascertain the number of direct or indirect holders of an interest
in the Tax Retained Notes and any interests in the Issuing Entity
treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

(ii) No holder of a Tax Retained
Note (or interest therein) shall acquire or transfer any Tax
Retained Note (or any interest therein) or cause any Tax Retained
Note (or any interest therein) to be marketed on or through an
“established securities market” within the meaning of
Section 7704(b)(1) of the Code, including, without limitation,
an over-the-counter market or an interdealer quotation system that
regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations.

(iii) Each holder of a Tax Retained
Note (or any interest therein) shall represent and warrant that it
(i) is not, and will not become, a partnership, a corporation
taxed under Subchapter S of the Code or a grantor trust (or
disregarded entity the single owner of which is any of the
foregoing) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (ii) is
such an entity and (x) at no time will more than 50% of the
value of any interest in such entity (or the single owner in the
case of a disregarded entity described above) be attributable to
such entity’s interest in the Tax Retained Notes and any
interests in the Issuing Entity treated as equity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes that it holds or beneficially owns and
(y) it is not and will not be a principal purpose of the
arrangement involving such holder’s interest in any Tax
Retained Notes or interests in the Issuing Entity to permit any
partnership to satisfy the 100 partner limitation of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) necessary for such
partnership not to be classified as a publicly traded partnership
under the Code.

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(iv) The provisions of this Section
of the Indenture generally are intended to prevent the Issuing
Entity from being characterized as a “publicly traded
partnership” within the meaning of Section 7704 of the
Code, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such intent into account
in determining whether or not the requirements of this
Section 2.15 have been complied with in connection with any
proposed transfer of any Tax Retained Note (or interest
therein).

(v) Each holder of a Tax Retained
Note (i) is a “United States person” as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and (ii) shall provide a
certification of non-foreign status, in such form as may be
requested by the Depositor or the Indenture Trustee (e.g., IRS Form
W-9), signed under penalties of perjury (and such other
certification, representations or Opinion of Counsel as may be
requested in this regard by the Depositor or the Indenture
Trustee).

SECTION 2.16 Calculation
Agent . U.S. Bank is hereby designated calculation agent with
respect to each Floating Rate Note (including any successor or
replacement calculation agent designated from time to time by
agreement of the parties hereto, the “ Calculation
Agent ”), and in such capacity, on each Interest
Determination Date, will (a) calculate the Interest Rate with
respect to each Class of the Floating Rate Notes if the Floating
Rate Note Balance is greater than zero on such Interest
Determination Date and (b) deliver to the Servicer written
notice on such Interest Determination Date of such Interest Rate.
All determinations of interest by the Calculation Agent shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and
binding on the Noteholders of the Floating Rate Notes. All
percentages resulting from any calculation on the Floating Rate
Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point, with five millionths of a percentage point
rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) would be rounded
to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or
resulting from that calculation on the Floating Rate Note will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded
upwards). The Calculation Agent may be removed by the Issuing
Entity at any time. If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling
to act as such or is removed by the Issuing Entity, the Issuing
Entity will promptly appoint as a replacement Calculation Agent a
leading bank which is engaged in transactions in Eurodollar
deposits and which does not control or is not controlled by or
under common control with the Issuing Entity or its Affiliates. The
Calculation Agent may not resign its duties without a successor
having been duly appointed.

COVENANTS

SECTION 3.01 Payments to
Noteholders, Trust Certificateholders and Depositor . The
Issuing Entity shall duly and punctually (i) pay the principal

Sections 5.04(b) and 8.04 , all payments of
amounts due and payable with respect to any Notes that are to be
made from amounts withdrawn from the Note Distribution Account or
the Reserve Account, if any, shall be made on behalf of the Issuing
Entity by the Indenture Trustee or by another Paying Agent, and no
amounts so withdrawn therefrom for payments on Notes shall be paid
over to the Issuing Entity except as provided in this Section. All
payments of amounts due and payable with respect to any Notes or
Trust Certificates that are to be made from amounts withdrawn from

(c) at any time during the
continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the

(e) comply with all requirements of
the Code with respect to the withholding from any payments made by

for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuing Entity Order direct
any Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in
trust by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture
Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were
held by such Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying
Agent to the Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released
from all further liability with respect to such money.

Subject to applicable laws with
respect to escheat of funds, any money held by the Indenture
Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of any amount
due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed after such
amount has become due and payable and after the Indenture Trustee
has taken the steps described in this paragraph shall be discharged
from such trust and be paid to Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle
Tennessee upon presentation thereto of an Issuing Entity Order, and
the related Noteholder shall thereafter, as an unsecured general
creditor, look only to the Issuing Entity for payment thereof, and
all liability of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money shall thereupon cease. If any
Noteholder shall not surrender its Notes for retirement within six
months after the date specified in the written notice of final
payment described in Section 8.04(e) , the Indenture
Trustee will give a second written notice to the registered
Noteholders that have not surrendered their Notes for final payment
and retirement. If within one year after such second notice any
Notes have not been surrendered, the Indenture Trustee shall, at
the expense and direction of the Issuing Entity, cause to be
published once, in an Authorized Newspaper, notice that such money
remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which
shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication,
any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to
Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee. The Indenture Trustee
shall also adopt and employ, at the expense and direction of the
Issuing Entity, any other reasonable means of notification of such
repayment specified by the Issuing Entity or the Administrative
Agent.

respect of which such misrepresentation or warranty was inaccurate
shall not have been eliminated or otherwise cured, for a period of

and (2) a majority of the Outstanding Amount of Notes, voting
as a single class, consent to such longer cure period) after there

and the Indenture Trustee by Noteholders representing at least the

representation or warranty and requiring it to be remedied and
stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default”
hereunder;

insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator or similar official of the Issuing Entity or for any
substantial part of the Owner Trust Estate, or ordering the winding
up or liquidation of the Issuing Entity’s affairs, and such
proceeding shall remain unstayed, undismissed and in effect for a
period of 90 consecutive days or immediately upon entry of any such
decree or order; or

(e) the commencement by the Issuing
Entity of a voluntary case under any applicable federal or state

Issuing Entity of any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, the failure by the Issuing Entity generally to pay its
debts as such debts become due or the taking of action by the
Issuing Entity in furtherance of any of the foregoing.

The Issuing Entity shall deliver to
the Indenture Trustee, each Rating Agency and each Noteholder,
within five Business Days after obtaining actual knowledge of the
occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an
Officer’s Certificate of any event that with the giving of
notice and the lapse of time would become an Indenture Default
under clauses (c) or (d), its status and what action the
Issuing Entity is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

Subject to the provisions herein
relating to the duties of the Indenture Trustee, if an Indenture
Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
this Indenture at the request or direction of any Noteholder, if
the Indenture Trustee reasonably believes that it will not be
adequately indemnified against the costs, expenses and liabilities
that might be incurred by it in complying with such request.
Subject to such provisions for indemnification and certain
limitations contained herein, Noteholders holding not less than a
Majority Interest of the Notes voting as a
 












 



24


 



(NALT 2016-B Indenture)






single class shall have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding or any remedy
available to the Indenture Trustee or exercising any trust power
conferred on the Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 5.02 Acceleration of
Maturity; Waiver of Indenture Default . If an Indenture Default
should occur and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee or
Noteholders representing a Majority Interest voting as a single
class may declare the principal of the Notes to be immediately due
and payable. Upon such declaration, the Indenture Trustee shall
promptly provide written notice to the Administrative Agent (and
the Administrative Agent will provide each Rating Agency with
notice thereof pursuant to Section 1.02(k) of the Trust
Administration Agreement). Such declaration may be rescinded by
Noteholders holding a Majority Interest voting as a single class
before a judgment or decree for payment of the amount due has been
obtained by the Indenture Trustee if (a) the Issuing Entity
has deposited with the Indenture Trustee an amount sufficient to
pay (i) all interest on and principal of the Notes and all
other amounts that would then be due hereunder as if the Indenture
Default giving rise to such declaration had not occurred and
(ii) all amounts advanced by the Indenture Trustee and its
costs and expenses; and (b) all Indenture Defaults (other than
the nonpayment of principal of the Notes that has become due solely
by such acceleration) have been cured or waived.

Prior to the acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes as provided in this Section 5.02
, Noteholders holding not less than a Majority Interest of the
Notes voting as a single class may waive any past Indenture Default
and its consequences except an Indenture Default (i) in
payment of principal of or interest on the Notes or (ii) in
respect of a covenant or provision hereof that cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of each Noteholder. In the case of
any such waiver, the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights
hereunder, respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Indenture Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

Upon any such waiver, such Indenture
Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and
not to have occurred, and any Indenture Default arising therefrom
shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred for
every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Indenture Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

If the Notes have been declared due
and payable following an Indenture Default, the Indenture Trustee
may institute proceedings to collect amounts due, exercise remedies
as a secured party (including foreclosure or sale of the Owner
Trust Estate) or elect to maintain the Owner Trust Estate and
continue to apply the proceeds from the Owner Trust Estate as if
there had been no declaration of acceleration. Any sale of the
Owner Trust Estate by the Indenture Trustee will be subject to the
terms and conditions of Section 5.04 .

SECTION 5.03 Collection of
Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Indenture Trustee
.

(a) The Issuing Entity covenants
that if there is a default in the payment of (i) any interest
on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such
default continues for a period of five days or (ii) the
principal of any Notes at the related Note Final Scheduled
Payment

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)






Date or the Redemption Date, the Issuing Entity
shall, upon demand of the Indenture Trustee, pay to the Indenture
Trustee, for the benefit of such Noteholders, the entire amount
then due and payable on such Notes for principal and interest, with
interest on the overdue principal, and, to the extent payment at
such rate of interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue
installments of interest, at the Overdue Interest Rate and in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Indenture Trustee and its agents, attorneys and
counsel.

(b) In case the Issuing Entity shall
fail forthwith to pay amounts described in
Section 5.03(a) upon demand, the Indenture Trustee, in
its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
Proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and
may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce the same against the Issuing Entity or other obligor upon
such Notes and collect in the manner provided by law out of the
property of the Issuing Entity or other obligor upon such Notes,
wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be
payable.

(c) If an Indenture Default occurs
and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, in its discretion,
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such
rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or
equitable right vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture
or by law.

(d) In case there shall be pending,
relative to the Issuing Entity or any other obligor upon the Notes
or any Person having or claiming an ownership interest in the Owner
Trust Estate, Proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code or any other
applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or
reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall
have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuing Entity
or its property or such other obligor or Person, or in case of any
other comparable judicial Proceedings relative to the Issuing
Entity or other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or
property of the Issuing Entity or such other obligor, the Indenture
Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any Notes shall
then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Indenture Trustee shall
have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section,
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
Proceedings or otherwise:

(i) to file and prove a claim or
claims for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Notes, and to file such other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Indenture Trustee (including any claim for reasonable
compensation to the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor
Indenture Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and
counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities
incurred, and all advances and disbursements made, by the Indenture
Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result
of negligence or bad faith) and of the Noteholders allowed in such
Proceedings;

(ii) unless prohibited by applicable
law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the Noteholders in any

and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in
order to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the
Issuing Entity, its creditors and its property;

and any trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official in any such
Proceeding is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make payments
to the Indenture Trustee and, if the Indenture Trustee shall
consent to the making of payments directly to such Noteholders to
pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to
cover reasonable compensation to the Indenture Trustee, each
predecessor Indenture Trustee and their respective agents,
attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities
incurred and all advances and disbursements made by the Indenture
Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee except as a result
of negligence or bad faith, and any other amounts due the Indenture
Trustee under Section 6.07 .

(e) Nothing herein contained shall
be deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee to authorize or
consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Noteholder or
to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such
proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a
trustee in bankruptcy or similar Person.

(f) All rights of action and of
asserting claims under this Indenture, or under the Notes, may be
enforced by the Indenture Trustee without the possession of the
Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other Proceedings
relative thereto, and any such action or Proceedings instituted by
the Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee
of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the
payment of the expenses, advances, disbursements and compensation
of the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and
their respective agents, attorneys and counsel shall be for the
ratable benefit of the Noteholders in respect of which such
judgment has been recovered.

(g) In any Proceedings brought by
the Indenture Trustee (and also any Proceedings involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be
held to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be
necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such
Proceedings.

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







SECTION 5.04 Remedies;
Priorities .

(a) If an Indenture Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may do one
or more of the following (subject to Sections 5.02 and
5.05 ):

(i) institute Proceedings in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all
amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with
respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any
judgment obtained, and collect from the Issuing Entity and any
other obligor upon such Notes monies adjudged due;

(ii) institute Proceedings from time
to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture
with respect to the Collateral;

(iii) exercise any remedies of a
secured party under the UCC and take any other appropriate action
to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders; and

(iv) subject to
Section 5.17 , and, if applicable, giving effect to any
direction of the Holder of the 2016-B SUBI Certificate (acting in
accordance with instructions from the Registered Pledgee) pursuant
to Section 12.05(b) of the 2016-B SUBI Supplement,
after an acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to
Section 5.02 , sell the Collateral or any portion
thereof or rights or interest therein, at one or more public or
private sales called and conducted in any manner permitted by law;
provided , however , that the Indenture Trustee may
not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral following an
Indenture Default, other than an Indenture Default described in
Section 5.01(a) or (b) , unless
(A) Noteholders holding 100% of the Outstanding Amount of
Notes consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale are
sufficient to discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid
upon all outstanding Notes or (C) the Indenture Trustee
determines that the Owner Trust Estate will not continue to provide
sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not been
declared due and payable and the Indenture Trustee obtains the
consent of Noteholders holding not less than 66  2
⁄ 3 % of the Outstanding Amount of Notes, voting
together as a single class; and provided further ,
that the Indenture Trustee may not sell the Collateral, other than
a sale resulting from the bankruptcy, insolvency or termination of
the Issuing Entity, unless it shall first have obtained an Opinion
of Counsel that such sale will not cause the Titling Trust or an
interest therein or portion thereof to be classified as an
association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In determining
such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses
(B) and (C) of the preceding sentence, the Indenture
Trustee may but need not obtain (at the expense of the Issuing
Entity) and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of
the Owner Trust Estate for such purpose.

(b) After an acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02 , the
Indenture Trustee shall pay out money or property held as
Collateral (including available monies on deposit in the Reserve
Account and any money or property collected pursuant to this
Article Five upon sale of all or part of the Collateral) and
deposited in the Note Distribution Account in accordance with
Section 8.04(b) .
 












 



28


 



(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(c) The Indenture Trustee may fix a
record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders
pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date,
the Issuing Entity shall mail to each Noteholder and the Indenture
Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and
the amount to be paid.

SECTION 5.05 Optional
Preservation of the Collateral . If the Notes have been
declared to be due and payable under Section 5.02
following an Indenture Default and such declaration and its
consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, the Indenture
Trustee may, but need not, elect to maintain possession of the
Collateral and continue to apply the proceeds thereof in accordance
with Sections 3.01 and 8.04 . It is the intent
of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there be at all
times sufficient funds for the payment of principal and interest on
the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such intent into
account when determining whether or not to maintain possession of
the Collateral. In determining whether to maintain possession of
the Collateral, the Indenture Trustee may but need not obtain (at
the expense of the Issuing Entity) and rely upon an opinion of an
Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national
reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to
the sufficiency of the Collateral for such purpose.

SECTION 5.06 Limitation of
Suits .

(i) Except to the extent expressly
set forth in Sections 7.07 or 11.21 of this
Indenture, no Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute
any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this
Indenture or the other Basic Documents, or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(i) such Noteholder previously has given to the Indenture
Trustee written notice of a continuing Indenture Default or a
breach of the Basic Documents by a party thereto (an “
Action ”), (ii) Noteholders holding not less than
25% of the Outstanding Amount of Notes, voting together as a single
class, have made written request to the Indenture Trustee to
institute such Proceeding in respect of such Indenture Default or
Action, as applicable, in its own name as Indenture Trustee,
(iii) such Noteholder has offered the Indenture Trustee
reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to
be incurred in complying with such request, (iv) the Indenture
Trustee has for 60 days after receipt of such notice failed to
institute such Proceedings and (v) no direction inconsistent
with such written request has been given to the Indenture Trustee
during such 60-day period by Noteholders holding at least a
Majority Interest, voting together as a single class.

No Noteholder or group of
Noteholders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue
of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect,
disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Noteholders or to
obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other
Noteholder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided.

In the event the Indenture Trustee
shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity
from two or more groups of Noteholders, each representing less than
a Majority Interest of the Notes, the Indenture Trustee in its sole
discretion may determine what action, if any, shall be taken,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.

Noteholders to Receive Principal and Interest . Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Indenture, any Noteholder shall have
the right to receive payment of the principal of and interest on,
if any, such Note on or after the respective due dates thereof
expressed in such Note or this Indenture (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not
be impaired without the consent of such Noteholder.

SECTION 5.08 Restoration of
Rights and Remedies . If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee or such Noteholder, then and in
every such case the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 5.09 Rights and Remedies
Cumulative . No right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders is intended to
be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or
hereafter existing at law, in equity or otherwise. The assertion or
employment of any right or remedy hereunder or otherwise shall not
prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 5.10 Delay or Omission
Not a Waiver . No delay or omission of the Indenture Trustee or
any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any
Default or Indenture Default shall impair any such right or remedy

Article or by law to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders may
be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the Noteholders, as the
case may be.

method and place of conducting any Proceeding or any remedy
available to the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or
with respect to the exercise of any trust or power conferred on the
Indenture Trustee, provided that:

(a) such direction shall not be in
conflict with any rule of law or this Indenture;

(b) subject to
Section 5.04 , any direction to the Indenture Trustee
to, sell or liquidate the Collateral shall be made by Noteholders

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(c) if the conditions set forth in
Section 5.05 have been satisfied and the Indenture
Trustee elects to retain the Collateral pursuant to such Section,
then any direction to the Indenture Trustee by Noteholders holding
less than 100% of the Outstanding Amount to sell or liquidate the
Collateral shall be of no force and effect; and

(d) the Indenture Trustee may take
any other action deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee that is not
inconsistent with such direction.

Notwithstanding the rights of
Noteholders set forth in this Section, subject to
Section 6.01 , the Indenture Trustee need not take any
action it determines might expose it to personal liability or might
materially adversely affect or unduly prejudice the rights of any
Noteholders not consenting to such action.

SECTION 5.12 [Reserved].

SECTION 5.13 Undertaking for
Costs . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each
Noteholder by such Noteholder’s acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion
require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee
for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may
in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, against any party litigant in such suit,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or
defenses made by such party litigant, but the provisions of this
Section shall not apply to (a) any suit instituted by the
Indenture Trustee, (b) any suit instituted by any Noteholder
or group of Noteholders, in each case holding Notes evidencing more
than 10% of the Outstanding Amount of Notes, voting together as a
single class or (c) any suit instituted by any Noteholder for
the enforcement of the payment of principal of or interest on any
Note on or after the related due dates expressed in such Note and
in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the
Redemption Date).

SECTION 5.14 Waiver of Stay or
Extension Laws . The Issuing Entity covenants (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist
upon, or plead or in any manner whatsoever, claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture, and the Issuing
Entity (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly
waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that
it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power
herein granted to the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit
the execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

SECTION 5.15 Action on Notes
. The Indenture Trustee’s right to seek and recover judgment
on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected by the
seeking, obtaining or application of any other relief under or with
respect to this Indenture. Neither the Lien of this Indenture nor
any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture
Trustee against the Issuing Entity or by the levy of any execution
under such judgment upon any portion of the Owner Trust Estate or
upon any of the assets of the Issuing Entity. Any money or property
collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance
with Section 5.04(b) .

SECTION 5.16 Performance and
Enforcement of Certain Obligations .

(a) Promptly following a request
from the Indenture Trustee to do so, the Issuing Entity shall take
all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may request to
compel or secure the performance and observance by the Depositor
and the Servicer, as applicable, of each of their obligations to
the Issuing Entity under or in connection with the Servicing
Agreement, in accordance with the terms thereof, and to exercise
any and all rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully
available to the Issuing Entity under or in connection with each
such agreement to the extent and in the manner directed by the
Indenture Trustee, including the transmission of notices of default
on the part of the Servicer thereunder and the institution of legal
or administrative actions or proceedings to compel or secure
performance by the Servicer of its obligations under the Servicing
Agreement.

(b) If an Indenture Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, and at the
direction (which direction shall be in writing or by telephone
(confirmed in writing promptly thereafter)) of Noteholders holding
not less than a Majority Interest of the Notes voting as a single
class, shall, exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and
claims of the Issuing Entity against the Depositor, the Titling
Trustee and the Servicer under or in connection with the Servicing
Agreement, including the right or power to take any action to
compel or secure performance or observance by the Servicer of its
obligations to the Issuing Entity thereunder and to give any
consent, request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver
under the Servicing Agreement, and any right of the Issuing Entity
to take such action shall be suspended.

SECTION 5.17 Sale of
Collateral . If the Indenture Trustee acts to sell the
Collateral or any part thereof, pursuant to
Section 5.04(a) , the Indenture Trustee shall effect
such a sale at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law in a commercially
reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms, which shall
include the solicitation of competitive bids. Unless otherwise
prohibited by applicable law from any such action, the Indenture
Trustee shall sell the Collateral or any part thereof, in such
manner to the highest bidder; provided , however ,
that the Indenture Trustee may from time to time postpone any sale.
The Indenture Trustee shall give notice to the Depositor and
Servicer of any proposed sale, and the Depositor and Servicer shall
be permitted to bid for the Collateral at any such sale. The
Indenture Trustee may obtain a prior determination from a
conservator, receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the Issuing
Entity that the terms and manner of any proposed sale are
commercially reasonable. The power to effect any sale of any
portion of the Collateral pursuant to Section 5.04 and
this Section shall not be exhausted by any one or more sales as to
any portion of the Collateral remaining unsold, but shall continue
unimpaired until the entire Collateral shall has been sold or all
amounts payable on the Notes shall have been paid. The Indenture
Trustee shall cause the proceeds of any such sale to be deposited
into the 2016-B SUBI Collection Account.

SECTION 6.01 Duties of Indenture
Trustee .

(a) If an Indenture Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall exercise
the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and in the
same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
such person’s own affairs.

(b) Except during the continuance of
an Indenture Default:

(i) the Indenture Trustee undertakes
to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations
shall be read into this Indenture against the Indenture Trustee;
and

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on
its part, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the
truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the
Indenture Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
Indenture; however, the Indenture Trustee shall examine the
certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform
on their face to the requirements of this Indenture and the other
Basic Documents to which the Indenture Trustee is a
party.

(c) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except
that:

(i) this paragraph does not limit
the effect of paragraph (b);

(ii) the Indenture Trustee shall not
be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith unless it is
proved that the Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the
pertinent facts; and

(iii) the Indenture Trustee shall
not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take
in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it
pursuant to Section 5.11 .

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(g) No provision of this Indenture
shall require the Indenture Trustee to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of
its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or
powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that
repayments of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or
liability is not reasonably assured to it.

(h) Every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Indenture Trustee shall be subject to
the provisions of this Section.

(i) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be deemed to have knowledge of any Indenture Default, breach of any
representation or warranty, or other event unless a Responsible
Officer has actual knowledge thereof or has received written notice
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. For
the avoidance of doubt, receipt by the Indenture Trustee of a
Review Report shall not constitute actual knowledge of any breach
of a representation or warranty.

SECTION 6.02 Rights of Indenture
Trustee .

(a) Except as provided by the second
succeeding sentence, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely
and shall be protected in acting upon or refraining from acting
upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, note, direction, demand,
election or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The
Indenture Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in
the document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture Trustee,
upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Indenture Trustee that shall be specifically required to be
furnished pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, shall
examine them to determine whether they comply as to form to the
requirements of this Indenture.

(b) Before the Indenture Trustee
acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer’s
Certificate (with respect to factual matters) or an Opinion of
Counsel, as applicable. The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable
for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance
on such Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of
Counsel.

(c) The Indenture Trustee may
execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties
hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys or a
custodian or nominee, and the Indenture Trustee shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of, or for
the supervision of, the Administrative Agent, any co-trustee or
separate trustee appointed in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.10 or any other such agent, attorney,
custodian or nominee appointed with due care by it
hereunder.

(d) The Indenture Trustee will be
liable for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it through
its own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith, except that
the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for (i) any error of
judgment made by it in good faith, unless it is proved that the
Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
facts, (ii) any action it takes or omits to take in good faith
in accordance with a direction received by it from the Noteholders
in accordance with the terms of this Indenture or
(iii) interest on any money received by it except as the
Indenture Trustee and the Issuing Entity may agree in
writing.

(NALT 2016-B Indenture)







(e) The Indenture Trustee may
consult with counsel, and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion
of Counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture
and the Notes shall be full and complete authorization and
protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted
or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with
the advice or opinion of such counsel. The Indenture Trustee may
consult with investment banking firms, accountants and other
experts with respect to the performance of its duties under this
Indenture, and the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any
action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the
advice of such investment banking firms, accountants or other
experts.

(f) Other than in connection with
any actions expressly required to be taken by the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to Section 7.08 , the Indenture Trustee shall
be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
vested in it by this Indenture or to institute, conduct or defend
any litigation under this Indenture or in relation to this
Indenture or to honor the request or direction of any of the
Noteholders pursuant to this Indenture unless such Noteholders
shall have offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable security or
indemnity against the reasonable costs, expenses, disbursements,
advances and liabilities that might be incurred by it, its agents
and its counsel in compliance with such request or
direction.

(g) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated
in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other
paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by the
holders of Notes evidencing not less than 25% of the Outstanding
Amount of Notes voting together as a single class; provided
, however , that if the payment within a reasonable time to
the Indenture Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely
to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the
opinion of the Indenture Trustee, not reasonably assured to the
Indenture Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of
this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee may require reasonable
indemnity against such cost, expense or liability as a condition to
so proceeding. The reasonable expense of each such investigation
shall be paid by the Person making such request, or, if paid by the
Indenture Trustee, shall be reimbursed by the Person making such
request upon demand.

(h) Any request or direction of the
Issuing Entity mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by
an Issuing Entity Request.

(i) The Indenture Trustee shall, for
so long as any Notes are outstanding, be entitled to exercise all
of the rights and powers of a Beneficiary under the Basic
Documents.

(j) The Indenture Trustee will not
be responsible for special, indirect, punitive or consequential
damages.

No provision of this Indenture shall
be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on the Indenture Trustee
or take or omit to take any action, suffer any action to be taken
or omitted, in the performance of its duties, or to exercise any
right or power hereunder, to the extent that taking or omitting to
take such action or suffering such action to be taken or omitted
would, in the judgment of the Indenture Trustee, expose it to
liability or violate applicable law binding upon it (which
determination may be based on an Opinion of Counsel).

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates Nissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-BHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 2 hrs 21 minsS&P Futures2,478.25+5.00 (+0.20%)Dow Futures21,675.00+29.00 (+0.13%)Nasdaq Futures5,979.50+31.50 (+0.53%)Fitch Rates Nissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-BBusiness WireSeptember 21, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Outlooks to the Nissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-B (NALT 2016-B) notes:--Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';--Class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSStable Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO score of 751 is consistent with prior NALT pools. The pool is primarily composed of 36-month leases, has seasoning of 11 months, and the base residual value percentage has decreased to 69.84% from 70.46% for NALT 2016-A.Adequate CE Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) is expected to be 16.50% of the initial securitization value (SV), growing to 17.50% of the initial SV, depending on the structure. Excess spread is expected to be 4.64%. Hard CE is unchanged from 2016-A.Stable Credit Loss: Credit losses on NMAC's portfolio and recent NALT securitizations have stabilized since the Great Recession. This trend has been supported by the improved obligor credit quality and higher recovery rates in recent securitizations. Fitch's credit loss proxy for 2016-B is 0.90%.Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: NMAC has adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations. Fitch deems NMAC capable of adequately servicing 2016-B.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to 125 sample leases. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the presale report dated Sept. 8, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 'Nissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-B -Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 2016.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the link.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Criteria for Rating U.S. Auto Lease ABS (pub. 24 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879019Read MoreGlobal Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchNissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-B -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/887471Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1011993ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1011993&flm_nm=15e_1011993_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1011993Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

      Fitch Rates Nissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-B
    





September 21, 2016 02:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Outlooks to the Nissan 
      Auto Lease Trust 2016-B (NALT 2016-B) notes:
    

      --Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --Class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO score of 751 
      is consistent with prior NALT pools. The pool is primarily composed of 
      36-month leases, has seasoning of 11 months, and the base residual value 
      percentage has decreased to 69.84% from 70.46% for NALT 2016-A.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) is expected to be 
      16.50% of the initial securitization value (SV), growing to 17.50% of 
      the initial SV, depending on the structure. Excess spread is expected to 
      be 4.64%. Hard CE is unchanged from 2016-A.
    

      Stable Credit Loss: Credit losses on NMAC's portfolio and recent NALT 
      securitizations have stabilized since the Great Recession. This trend 
      has been supported by the improved obligor credit quality and higher 
      recovery rates in recent securitizations. Fitch's credit loss proxy for 
      2016-B is 0.90%.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: NMAC has adequate 
      capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical delinquency and loss performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations. Fitch deems NMAC capable of adequately servicing 2016-B.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to 125 sample 
      leases. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the 
      findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related 
      rating action commentary.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Sept. 8, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Nissan Auto Lease Trust 2016-B -Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 2016.

Always negotiate up from the invoice price, not down from the MSRP.Step 5: Ask about lease incentives and cash rebate offers. Incentives and rebates will allow you to save more money on your car lease. You can also apply the cash rebates as a down payment to your lease, effectively giving you lower monthly payments.The best Nissan lease deals are just a click away!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
