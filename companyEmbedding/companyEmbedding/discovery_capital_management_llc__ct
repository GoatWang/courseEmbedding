For Entrepreneurs



Where We Invest, and What Ventures We Look For
We raised capital under the Small Business Venture Capital Act of British Columbia.  Our investors received an Investment Tax Credit from the Government of British Columbia, and consequently we are obligated to invest in ventures (eligible small businesses) that are domiciled in BC exclusively.
We also invest exclusively in growth-stage technology ventures, specializing in;  information technology, mobile applications, life sciences, and cleantech sectors.
We are most interested in promising, energetic companies that have developed their first technology product to at least the commercialization stage, preferably have referenceable early-adopter users, have their first revenue-paying customers, and are on a fast growth trajectory guided by a visionary management team.
Eligibility for Investment
We must invest in “eligible small businesses” meeting the following four requirements:

A business must be incorporated in B.C.; incorporated extra-provincially in B.C; or incorporated federally.
The business, together with affiliates, must have less than 100 employees at the time of our initial investment. We may make additional investments if the employment level grows beyond 100.
The business must pay at least 75% of its wages and salaries to B.C. employees.  This may be reduced to 50% if the business is engaged in the export of goods or services outside B. C.
The business must be “substantially engaged” in one or more of the prescribed business activities outlined in section 11(1) of the Small Business Venture Capital Regulation (the “Regulations”).

Click here for detailed information on eligible small businesses and investment eligibility.
It Starts with your Business Plan
A business plan is a sales document. It must convince us that the venture has the potential to be successful, so enthusiasm, dedication and confidence in the business should be evident.  A business plan should assume we are not familiar with the business, and should focus on all aspects of the business, the investment required, and liquidity considerations for investors – NOT just describe a technology.  The plan should reflect current reality, market considerations, present and future goals, and significant milestones.
The Canada Business Network website is a good resource for preparing a Business Plan.
How to Submit Your Business Plan
If you don’t know us, have someone we know and respect refer you.  The referral from a respected colleague or angel investor carries a lot of weight in introducing your venture.
We ask for a Business Plan summary to be emailed to us to info@discoverycapital.com, or if you prefer, to one of our team members.   We will quickly review it to determine if we are able to consider the investment.  There are considerations beyond your Business Plan that may preclude us from working with you.

 Is the venture eligible for us to invest?
Is your stage of development right for us?
Are we seeking an investment in your industry, or are we fully invested in your sector?
Is the investment, or your future financing need, too small or too large for us?
Is your liquidity outlook suitable for us?

If the venture looks like a potential fit, we will invite you to present the opportunity in person.
