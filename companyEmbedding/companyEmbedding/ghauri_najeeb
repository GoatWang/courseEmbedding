Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you, Patti and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I will begin my remarks with an overview of our third quarter results as follows.
Total net revenues for the third quarter was about $18 million. This represents an increase of 12.5% from the prior year period. This was a record Q3 for NetSol and we are on track to deliver record revenues for the third consecutive year in fiscal 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million in the third quarter and net income was $700,000 in Q3 or $0.06 earnings per share. 
From an overall market perspective, we continue to see solid demand for our solution across our geographic footprint, and we are executing well with both new and existing customers. We remain excited and very optimistic about NetSol's future growth prospects. And we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant long term growth opportunity in the global finance and leasing industry.
At the same time, we remain intensely [indiscernible] our goal of driving margin expansion and increasing our earnings per share growth. Looking closer at the fiscal Q3 results, we delivered a strong quarter for NFS Ascent license and services revenue driven primarily by our large 12-country contract. 
We remain on track with this multi-year, multi-country implementation and we continue to be pleased with our progress with this important client. On the other side, our legacy NFS revenue was softer than we expected in the third quarter. Several of our clients are now beginning to explore with us their migration path from legacy NFS to NFS Ascent, which has resulted in a greater than expected slowdown in NFS license and services revenues, especially in Asia-Pacific or China to be more specific.

We believe this tactical shift in our clients demand towards Ascent from our legacy solutions represents a significant long-term opportunity for us as we believe our existing client portfolio represents the most immediate and logical new growth opportunity for our NFS Ascent solution.
However, this positive long-term trend is also impacting our results in the near-term, contributing to our reduced fiscal year 2017 guidance that Roger will discuss later in the call. While we are tracking below are prior 2017 expectations, as I look ahead the momentum we are noticing in terms of global demand for our solutions suite, the progress we're making in our sales and marketing executions for NFS Ascent, and the advancement of our cost efficiency program gives me confidence in our ability to drive improved revenue and earnings growth in the years ahead.
I like to now discuss with you some trend and highlights we are noticing in a business, which support our very positive outlook for NetSol. Beginning with our largest market Asia-Pacific, this is currently our most active market in terms of new NFS Ascent opportunities. In China, we are beginning to see a meaningful pickup in interest and increased activity from our existing NFS R1 clients who are now looking to potentially upgrade their platforms to NFS Ascent to address the future needs of their rapidly expanding portfolios.
This trend is highly encouraging, since as I mentioned earlier, we believe our existing clients are the most logical and immediate opportunities for transition to NFS Ascent over the medium-term. Given our commanding market share with 29 clients, including both multinationals and local tariff companies, and the strength of our Ascent solution we believe we are in a position of strength as the auto leasing industry continues to expand in China. 
Looking outside of China in our other APAC markets such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Australia, we have a growing pipeline of Tier 1 and Tier 2 prospects for NFS Ascent, as well as new client opportunities for legacy product suite. In Indonesia, for example, we recently announced a five-year product license and maintenance service agreement with Mizuho Balimor Finance or MBF, one of Indonesia's largest multi-finance companies for our mobile or international or point-of-sale system and we were also named MBF’s preferred vendor in the region.
Additionally during the quarter, we became a member of Indonesia's leading financial services association giving us access to the association’s large network of lease finance companies in the country, which has already led to increased interest and activity from prospects. Turning to the European market, we are noticing a decline in new license sales of our regional lease sales solution to both new and existing clients.
While we continue to generate consistent maintenance and change request revenue from lease off, outlook for growth is limited. However, we believe the European market is ready for NFS Ascent. To help drive future sales of NFS Ascent we have realigned our European sales and marketing teams and are focusing dedicated resources towards driving increased penetration of Ascent into the region.
In our North American market, we continue to have a healthy pipeline across our solution suite. While NFS Ascent is still relatively new to the North American market we are quite encouraged by the traction we are noticing and we are pursuing a handful of new potential opportunities. 
Alongside the work, we are going to drive ascent sales in the market. We recently strengthened our lease back SaaS offering and did re-launch at an industry lead event, which has resulted in substantial traction and lead generation for NetSol.
Finally, I’m very pleased to say that we just recently went live with the NFS R1 Solution in the Mexico operations of a US-based Fortune 500 drug manufacturing company. This implementation in Mexico is an exciting milestone for NetSol as it opens the door to the Latin American market with a strong referenceable client.

Before moving on, I would like to focus back on NFS Ascent specifically. Overall, I want to emphasize that we remain excited and highly optimistic about the long-term success of our next-generation platform. A meaningful penetration will take time, but we are seeing solid interest for multinational auto captive global equipment finance companies, banks, and existing customers for NFS Ascent.
Our Global Accent pipeline currently includes many Tier 1 and Tier 2 auto asset finance companies. And the level of RFP, which is a request for proposals activity in number of ongoing conversation we're having continuously raise our level of confidence in the growth potential of this winner solution.
Our pipeline includes both upgrades from legacy NFS to NFS Ascent, as well as organic opportunities from new prospects. Many of these potential opportunities represent multi-country multi-million dollar implementations. While we are encouraged by the momentum we are noticing in our Ascent pipeline, at the same time we are also experiencing longer than expected sales and delivery cycles, predominantly due to the complexities in the procurement process of a large client prospect. However, we have extensive experience working within these processes and remain confident in our success given our solid track record.
Finally, I would like to address the productivity and cost reduction initiatives that we announced on our last quarterly call, and I’m pleased to say that we made strong progress on this plan and we are on track to deliver $1.5 million of cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and $4 million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal 2018. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for additional cost reduction through consolidation and streamlining our global operation.
With that, I’d like now to turn the call over to Roger Almond to review our financial performance. Roger?
Roger Almond
Thank you, Najeeb. I will begin with a review of our fiscal third quarter financial results before discussing our fiscal year 2017 guidance. I will then turn the call back to Najeeb for closing remarks before opening the call for your questions. Total revenues for the third quarter were $17.9 million, representing an increase of 12.4% year-over-year. Total license fees for the third quarter were $5.7 million were then tripling the $1.8 million we delivered in the third quarter 2016.
Our strong growth in the quarter primarily reflects increased license fees and the 12-country Ascent contract with our largest customer. Maintenance fees for the third quarter were $3.6 million, an increase of 5.1% from $3.4 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by new customer agreements that went live with our products during late fiscal 2017 and into fiscal year 2017.
Services revenues were $8.6 million for the fiscal third quarter, a decrease of approximately 19.5% from $10.7 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in our services revenue, primarily reflects a decrease in implementation services, as well as lower revenue generated from our NetSol innovation joint venture with One Ensure [ph]. 
Total cost of revenues were $9 million for the third quarter, an increase of 4.4% from the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by a higher salaries, consultant cost, and travel expenses. Gross profit for the third quarter was $9 million or 50.1% of total net revenues, up 21.7% from $7.4 million or 46.3% in net revenues in the prior year period.
Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $7.2 million, an increase of 16.2% from $6.2 million in the same period last year. The increase in our operating expenses, primarily reflects increased spend in support of our product and solution sales effort and higher, general and administrative expenses related to strategic hires, which is partially offset by lower R&D cost and depreciation and amortization.

GAAP net income attributable to NetSol for the fiscal third quarter 2017, inclusive of minority interest was $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.8 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year period. Growth in our revenue and operating profit was primarily offset by higher non-controlling interest in the third quarter 2017, driven by a geographic mix of profits.
Moving to our non-GAAP metrics, adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million in the fiscal third quarter 2017 consistent with the $2.3 million in the prior year period. At March 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $8.5 million, compared with $11.6 million at June 30, 2016 and $11.9 million at March 31, 2016.
Before moving to our guidance I like to address the restatement of our prior financial report, which is also mentioned in our earnings press release. Based upon our new independent auditor’s position regarding the timing of revenue recognition for our complex 12-country NFS Ascent contract, we will amend our financial statements for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.
To be clear, the revisions related to the timing of when the revenue should have been realized and not the revenue itself is based primarily upon our auditor’s position on revenue recognition for this complex contract, which differs from our prior methodology. Importantly, the impact from these revisions are immaterial to our reported financial results for the year ended June 30, 2016 and in the nine months ended March 31, 2017.
More specifically, the net impact from the amendments to our revenue and net income for the first six months of fiscal 2016 is zero. In addition, for the first six months of fiscal 2017 ended December 31, 2016, the total impact of the restatement to our net revenue is a positive 296,000, and impact to our net income is a positive 197,000. Further detail of the amendment can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.
Now moving on to our guidance, as Najeeb mentioned, the slowdown in legacy NFS license and services revenues is expected to continue to impact our fiscal 2017 second half results. In addition, the non-conversion of some new client contracts that we expected to materialize in the second half of fiscal 2017 is also having an impact on our guidance. As a result, we are revising our full year fiscal 2017 guidance for net revenues down to $66 million to $67 million and our EBITDA guidance range down to $5 million to $6 million.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Najeeb for some closing remarks.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thanks Roger. While we are experiencing a softer than expected fiscal 2017 the strong fundamental long-term drive of our business remain unchanged. First, we are a leader in a large and growing market with significant opportunity for continued share gain, especially in the high-growth Asia Pacific market, and in North America where we see tremendous wide space for growth.
Second, we see significant opportunities for growth driven by our industry leading NFS Ascent solution. As I mentioned before, we are very encouraged by the momentum we are noticing in our Ascent pipeline. We view every single one of our major multinational client as a potential target when upgraded to NFS Ascent.
As our client's businesses continue to grow, we believe they will have a greater need to transition to our NFS Ascent solution to address the need for a more robust platform that has the ability to manage much higher volumes. And third, our broad suite of legacy products such as lease back in North America, our NFS R1 in few markets, and APAC in Latin America are right for these legacy solutions.
Our wealth of knowledge gained from working with large multinational clients, our local expertise, and lower cost of delivery continue to enable us to serve multiple market segments in varying stages of maturity.

In addition to our top line growth drivers, our ongoing focus on generating additional margin expansion through organizational transformation and cost reduction initiatives will help to drive increased EPS growth. We will continue to carefully review our cost that is specifically focused on optimizing them in order to drive a mentality of long-term profitable growth for our business.
With that, I like to open the call for questions operator.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Howard Halpern with Taglich Brothers. Please go ahead.
Howard Halpern
Good morning guys.
Najeeb Ghauri
Hi, Howard.
Howard Halpern
Hi. In terms of, you talked about the sales cycle and could you sort of break it down between, I guess new potential customers, and what you believe the sales cycle is for the legacy customers that are likely to convert? And also in terms of that, what is the potential of, say half of your legacy customers would have eventually convert? What is that pool of potential revenue?
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes, thank you for asking that question. I will have Naeem answer that please.
Naeem Ghauri
Hi, Howard. We have at least three of our existing legacy clients in China who have expressed interest, not only interest, we are under RFP, an evaluation process. And there is at least one more new prospect out of China, which is also evaluating the software. So between these four, we are very well-positioned. The sales cycles are long as you said in the press release, and the value process itself is quite stringent and there are several rounds of presentation and demonstration, the workshop that go on. Because typically these solutions last like 10 years to 15 years, and it is mission critical software.
So, certainly they have a very, very regimented procurement process to evaluate the solution. So, it’s hard to predict the timing on these, but we are well into the RFP’s, I say prudentially we are about half way through and we started about two months to three months ago. So, I would say, we will start to make good progress by Q1, Q2 of next year in all of these.
Howard Halpern
Okay.
Naeem Ghauri
And your last question was on the revenue, I think that is the tough one, but these are typically multi-million dollars, they are very large deals. One of them is at least for multiple countries, for the new prospect and the others are for China at the moment, but these clients are also in other markets, so potentially can be multiple markets too.
Howard Halpern
Okay. Now in terms of the cost reduction that’s going on, is that going to primarily be felt in the gross margin because I did see in the fourth quarter G&A was up sequentially, so are we really focusing here on gross margin rather than G&A?
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes. I think I will add one comment and then maybe Roger can comment. I think we concluded this first phase of our cost rationalization around the first quarter, I mean the third quarter, which was March, the one we just reported. So the impact of that is not showing, maybe showing partly in the P&L because in that period we also, it is routine annual increments for the core team in Lahore, which is almost 900 of them. So that is a little watch, but I think as I said, we are confident that by the time we finish the second half or when we report June 30, we would have seen at least $1.5 million of net impact from that cost-cutting initiative.
Howard Halpern
Okay, I will turn it back then.
Najeeb Ghauri 
Roger, you want to add anything more on this?
Roger Almond
Well I think the answer to the question, I think you will see it in two places, but you do have the reduction of the personnel up in the - it will be part of your cost of revenue, you know we look across all areas of where we could maybe have some excess fat, I guess out there and we want to cut. So that would be in the G&A expenses also. So, I think at the end of the fourth quarter you will see both the cost of revenue number coming down in line and you will see some G&A decrease also as we look to cut cost in both those areas.

Howard Halpern
Okay, sounds good. I’ll jump back in the queue.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mike Vermut with Newland Capital. Please go ahead.
Mike Vermut
Hi guys. Got a few questions for you here. I guess kind of hitting on that same subject concerning the contracts we are currently bidding on, are a lot of these competitively bid, are they renewals and looking to upgrade to Ascent? Just looking at the probability that we will be the winner on those? And moving out of Asia into the Americas and Europe, what are the sizes of those deals and where are we in that process? I remember a little while ago we were one of the final, it sounded like one of the final bidders on the a few of them possibly and just how everything is progressing there.
Najeeb Ghauri
Naeem, you want to answer that?
Naeem Ghauri
Yes, sure. So the one that we just mentioned in China and Asia, they are upgrade projects. They are three of them Mike. They are still competitive because all major Tier 1 companies buy their own internal compliance, the procurement compels them to go to market - go to tender. They cannot choose the incumbent, but that’s typically the compliance internally. However, switching to new vendor is always a big risk, and so there is a lot of hedging if they stay with the incumbent, so because we have distinct advantages in understanding the data and their business and their processes and any new vendor that comes in has to have a pretty steep learning curve, otherwise they cannot succeed. So that’s why we are in a very, very strong position, but we certainly still are in a competitive landscape. You know that wouldn't change. There is very, very few companies Mike that would award a contract and that kind of value without a competitive tender.
Mike Vermut
Right. Just before we go on to Americas and Europe, are we talking on these upgrades, multi-year $10 million, $20 million type contracts that we're looking at here? Is it, obviously it is not the Daimler size, but they are huge contracts that would kind of pad our growth for years to come? If we get them?
Naeem Ghauri
All the three clients we are dealing with for the upgrade, they are very large volume - they would be in the Tier 1 space in China. They have hundreds of thousands of cars on these and finance. So they would spend that kind of money. It would be difficult for them to not do, you know it is the other way around. So it is very well within the 20 to 20 million, for each of them. And then one of them is a multiple country, but they will start with China and they will want to then rollout to another seven or eight markets, similar to the other contracts that we have.
Mike Vermut
Okay. And I don't want to paint you in the corner, but you would say probability because we are incumbent it’s quite high that we win these over the next 6 to 9 months?
Najeeb Ghauri
Well [indiscernible] probability a name because we have to cautious…
Mike Vermut
I didn't say probability, I didn't say a number, I said I high [ph] probability in your opinion?
Najeeb Ghauri
I already said that Mike, we are in a very good position being the incumbent, you know.
Mike Vermut
Great, excellent. Okay. So, now Europe and the Americas.
Naeem Ghauri
Yes. So, Europe is, we are in the middle of an implementation for an SM client and we expect the go live is imminent, that’s going to make us very referenceable in Europe. So we have been waiting for that to happen and I think the first phase should be in the month of June, and we will definitely make an announcement when that happens. That suddenly opens the door to a number of new potential prospects. In the US, we have currently two opportunities that we're working on very diligently. 
There was two others where one of the companies have decided to not go ahead with the project anywhere, they just - it wasn't like we lost it to anybody else. So that project is put on hold and yes we were actually at the top of the list of the four or five vendors that they had. But unfortunately they have said, they want to probably differ it for six months to a year. So we will know then what happens. The other one, we are still waiting to hear. So there is one that is deferred, there is one we're waiting to hear and there is two more, which we are working on.

Mike Vermut
Okay. And from what you see, I guess what are the rough sizes of the - what kind of contracts are we talking about size wise in the US, and if you can give us some color into the competitive bidding process? Who are the others that were out there against and how those look for us in your opinion?
Najeeb Ghauri
Do you want to have Jeff jump in of do you want…
Naeem Ghauri 
Mike we don’t - Jeff you can come in a second, but I'm just going to say one point and then maybe Jeff can come with more color, but all of the Ascent deals that we are doing, we're not going to do anything south of $10 million because we - it is a premium solution with a huge amount of R&D into it and the kind of clients we are attracting would expect to spend that kind of money over 5 years to 10 years, you know. So, we would be, we would not be looking at anything less than that.
Mike Vermut
Great. Okay.
Naeem Ghauri
Jeff, you want to say anything?
Jeff Bilbrey
Yes, I could add to that a little bit. So, when we talk about these deals, it might help to contextualize a little bit further. A couple of them are in the finance or banking sector and over the course of a few years those are going to be worth millions of dollars, probably not north of 10. And one of them is with a multinational auto captive and that one is definitely north of $10 million in terms of values. So, these are all active pursuits. 
Obviously, can’t give names or anything like that, but very active pursuits, we are deep into the process again, and just to add some color to what names really was, you know one of those that we lost, just sort of flexibility at the Ascent platform, so I just mentioned auto captives and banks and the one that went on hold because of an internal reorg decision and they will come back in six months or a year, that was actually where the software company looking to finance their software products. It is one of the top three software companies globally. A brand name that we all know and we were the finalists there. 
Unfortunately, before we got to put ink on paper or anything like that they did have to go quiet because of an internal reorg.. So we are seeing good traction in the marketplace, we are seeing that the Ascent platform is broad and able to go across industries and whether that’s banking finance or other specialty, and so we are getting along and we're hopefully going to get one of these closed here.
Mike Vermut
Excellent. Then that takes us back to - I have a couple of more for you here, so based on what you see here, obviously it is taking longer to close, but these are large deals, right. So if we get a few of these closed like you said in the first, second quarter we should see and with the cost savings we should see decent revenue and EPS growth into 2018 and 2019. Right, if these things fall into place, nothing has stagnated here.
Najeeb Ghauri
No, I think as I said in my prepared remarks I have looked at as quite promising Mike. We are quite encouraged and excited about the board outlook due to all these deal we just heard from Naeem and Jeff, and the good thing is, you are hitting more interest from our existing clients in China, especially, who wants to upgrade to Ascent. There are three or four of them and then Jeff just mentioned about the North America. I believe it is again a matter of timing when we can sign them, when we can book them, in which quarter, in which part of the - first half, second half, time will tell. I guess when we report year-end we will be in a better position to share some later at that time.
Mike Vermut
Excellent. And then my last question, this is more of a bigger picture, from other research we can do here, we have the best product out there, I think we have the best cost structure, right, we have - with the engineers in Lahore, our cost structure probably can't be replicated. Is it the company, and I know that there is a lot of leasing bids out there, is there anything in your opinion holding it back or is it just bad timing on all of this? Is there anything else competitively that’s changed out there, is it who we are going up against with their balance sheet, is it larger competitors or is it just timing and it is just taking longer?

Najeeb Ghauri
Yes, go ahead.
Naeem Ghauri
I think the issue is not really some way the competition because from our own research Mike, when we embarked on the Ascent program we knew what was being offered by competitors. So, I can tell you one thing there is not even one company out there that have invested completely organically into a new product from ground up. What they have done is that they have taken the existing products and modernized them all, give them a good makeover. To fundamentally change architecture, your tech stack and go to market with the new product. It is more painstaking. 
However the results then actually position you at a different level from your competition. So we continuously meet prospects and clients who were surprised and quite frankly blown away with what they see with Ascent. So that’s why we are getting so much traction and some of those Tier 1’s, which never looked at as before are inviting us to tender and I don't know whether you read the news. One of our competitors, which is similar size, you should actually look them up.
In the UK there is a company called Alpha, I don't know if you have heard about them or not, they are a similar size company and they just are going to do an IPO in June at 800 million sterling evaluation. And their revenue - so I am just saying, I believe we are grossly undervalued for whatever reasons. So, I think at some point we will get on the radar and then people will realize that what we have to offer is really quite compelling as opposed to some of our competitors.
Mike Vermut
Excellent. And then one last question. So the way I look at the balance sheet, as these start to hit and as the large contract out there starts to build, cash should start to increase on the balance sheet, looking forward collection wise, and then with the cost cuts coming in?
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes, I think both will have positive impact, you are absolutely right.
Mike Vermut
Okay. So should this be a low point on the cash and then it is not - we are not in a bad position by any means, but should we assume cash starts to build from here?
Najeeb Ghauri
I think we got pretty good sound receivables. If you look at pretty sizable receivables, but also excess revenue building, so we are pretty comfortable with those receivables.
Mike Vermut
Excellent. Okay. All right appreciate it and good luck on these wins there. I do believe it will change the dynamics of the company when they start landing.
Najeeb Ghauri 
Sure. Thank you, Mike.
Naeem Ghauri
Thank you, Mike.
Roger Almond
Yes, thanks Mike.

Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you, Patti, and welcome everyone. To those in the call phone here in the U.S. and North America as well as from Europe and Asia. Today I am reporting from NetSol Technology Campus in the Lahore and joined from Bangkok by Naeem Ghauri, President and Head of Global Sales; and Roger Almond, Chief Financial Officer from our Headquarters in LA.
I am also very pleased to welcome a special guest today. Jeff Bilbrey, who currently served on the Company’s Board, Jeff is an experience technology executive with expertise creative, delivering, and sustaining technology products and related services. These founded a Boutique IT Strategy Consulting business and as guided product strategy across seven countries.
We also led the North American technology operating division for The Innovation Group launch the highly successful joint venture partners. I am pleased to announce on the call today the Jeff will be joining NetSol to lead the North America division at the present of North America and our globe initiative NFS Ascent in the region. And he will be hearing from later in the call.
Now turning to our results reported earlier this morning. The quarter came in had expected with continuation of multiple contract underway from our - for our entire portfolio of finance and leasing solutions. Importantly, we remain on track there is solid finish to the year, achieving our guidance and profitability objectives.

During the quarter we began our $8 million NFS Ascent implementation in the UK and the 12-country $100 million plus NFS Ascent contract. While this timing of when work began on these contracts slightly affected our service revenue on a sequential basis. Work is now ramping up in the current fourth quarter.
Again we remain on track with our revenue target for the year and our confidence is our growth - in our growth trajectory is moving forward. Part of the confidence tends from the 12-country Ascent implementation that began in the quarter starting in South Korea, South Africa, Australia and China, the China accounting for the largest implementation.
Each of these countries provides an another important reference point and our marketing efforts specially to expanding client base in China. We remain very excited about the market opportunity in the country as more finance company end of the Chinese market and finance and leasing of autos increased adoption something highlighted in the past calls.
According to our recent report about the China markets millennials those born in the 80s and 90s are increasingly turning forward financial products for purchasing cars with the penetration rate of those who have either finance or lease expected to reach 50% in the country by 2020.
Exceeding $2 trillion [RMB] that compares to a penetration rate in the low teens today. That is a large growth. This translates to increased needs to our customers and ultimately higher value projects as customers are prospect manage more contracts on our system. This is also one reason why it is important for us to continue to penetrate the European and North American markets where nearly every financials or leases versus space all cash or purchases.
Without our expanded team in Europe and soon to be expanded to even North America, we are focused on capturing market share and helping our clients improve their productivity and consolidate IT systems and create new efficient ways of conducting business.
Looking at our pipeline today it continues to remain strong further benefiting from The 12-country NFS AscentTM implementation which we believe is the largest deal announced in our space. Their investment of more than $100 million plus and the scale in which they're implementing it demonstrates their confident investment in our solution.
We now focus on the deliveries and going live in each of these countries which will provide additional confidence to our prospect and further benefit our marketing efforts. Indeed it is a very exciting time and we are focused on driving improved value for the shareholders.
With that I'll turn the call over to Roger to review our financial performance. Roger?
Roger Almond
We reported 23% year-over-year growth for the quarter with total net revenue of approximately $16 million compared with $13.1 million last year. Total license, services and maintenance revenue were up year-over-year. Total license revenue was $1.8 million which included contributions from our entire portfolio of solutions of more than $1 million from the sequentially 2016 second quarter.
Total maintenance fees were stable at $3.4 million. Total services revenue advanced a $10.7 million from $8.8 million last year. For the 2016 second quarter services were slightly down primarily related to when work begin on the 12-country contract. We expect services to be strong moving forward as we make progress on the contract as well as others underway.
As a percentage of total revenue, total cost of revenue for the second quarter of 2016 decreased to 53% from 64% for the same period last year. Gross profit rose to $7.5 million from $4.7 million last year. Operational expenses were $6.3 million for the 2016 third quarter nearly flat year-over-year.

We expect our cost in fourth quarter to remain relatively consistent with our third quarter. On a GAAP basis net income for the third quarter improved to $849,000 or $0.08 per diluted share, as compared with a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.17 per share, in the third quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA which primarily removes depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2016, or adjusted EPS of $0.30 per diluted share, as compared with adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million, or adjusted EPS of $0.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2016, total net revenues advanced to $45.5 million, with services income comprising $31.9 million. This compares with total net revenue of $35.7 million for the same period one year ago, with services revenues comprising $21.6 million. GAAP net income was $1.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, versus a net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.51 per share, for the same period last year.
At March 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $11.8 million compared to $14.2 million at June 30, 2015. During the quarter, we purchased 705,000 shares of NetSol PK common stock and a total of 1.4 million shares for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 for $767,000, resulting in an overall decrease in non-controlling interest to 33.4%.
Turning now to our outlook. We continue to expect minimum revenue of $62 million for the fiscal year and on the bottom line we expect to exceed $1 in adjusted EPS for the year. As we had additional revenue moving forward, we are confident in our ability to build leverage in the business especially as we expect to add more revenue from Europe and eventually North America.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Naeem. Naeem?
Naeem Ghauri
Thank you, Roger. We are extremely pleased with our progress and with revenue for the first nine months up more than 27% compared to the same period last year. And we are only just getting started with 12 country implementation, which included China, South Africa, South Korea and Australia as well as the $8 million contract Ascent business that we signed in Europe and which Najeeb described earlier.
And as a result, our target market remains extremely strong and our sales pipeline continues to track ahead of expectation. Our sales and marketing teams throughout the world are extremely busy and we are benefiting from a center sites in Europe and Asia as well as the 12-country regional implementation providing a strong reference for the rest of the world.
As you go live in our large programs, it adds to those considering our next gen solution including those in North America. North America is an important market for us, where we have long-term client base. To head up our growth initiatives in that region I'm pleased now to introduce Jeff Bilbrey. Over to you Jeff.
Jeffrey Bilbrey
Thanks, Naeem and good morning. I joined the Board in 2013 and have had the pleasure since then I’ve seen NetSol’s positive transformation firsthand, including the deployment of the aforementioned next generation solution and additions and expansion of marquee client logos across the globe.
Knowing the Company's strategy and market opportunity and its deep connection with customers and the technology behind the products and also having known the people and talent at NetSol since my days with innovation group where I launched the highly successful joint venture with NetSol. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to lead the NetSol North America operations.
I truly believe the market is right for NFS Ascent and we have an excellent opportunity to build upon a strong client base in the U.S. and further penetrate the market adding new clients as well. So I'm happy to say that I transitioned from the Board to start with NetSol on May 23, and we look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Najeeb.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you, Jeff. Standing where we are today with large contract now underway and initiatives throughout the world I and excited and energized about NetSol future and confident in our talented team. For that remaining time, I will now open the call up for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question this morning will come from Howard Halpern of Taglich Brothers. Please go ahead.
Howard Halpern
Congratulations guys. Great quarter.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you.
Howard Halpern
The first question I guess license revenue, was it mostly comprised of legacy or was it more of a combination with Ascent product?
Najeeb Ghauri
Roger, please you jump in.
Roger Almond
Yes. They are combination of both. We had some legacy products sold into Australia and into China and then we also had our Ascent product with those in Europe and with the Asia Pacific area, so a combination of both of those.
Howard Halpern
And going forward with the implementation of the $100 million contract, the European contract you believe that you could drive gross margin to that 50% mark in the next couple of quarters?
Najeeb Ghauri
We did 47.5% in Q3 we distributed today and we are from almost 37% for the nine months also which is a pretty healthy trend. You can see our control in our hiring and if there is profit sales I believe it is a reasonable goal and we are also aiming that in 15 range in the coming quarters.
Howard Halpern
Okay. And can you describe I guess you know how the implementation in the $100 million contract is going in I guess in terms of the country rotation I guess that your planning on executing.
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes, Naeem, please answer.
Naeem Ghauri
Yes, Howard, we have got four countries currently under implementation which is China, South Africa, Australia and South Korea? This is quite a heavy if you like workload and our resources are extremely busy. Each of these four countries are kind of major in their own right in terms of size and volume of business. So we are busy with that so what will happen is each of - one of these countries go life. We backfill it with another market. So that we had any given time we are able to do for in parallel. So you know see the fifth country sixth coming as soon as the first and the second go live.
Howard Halpern
Okay. I guess this question might be for Jeff, North America. What do you see is the real opportunity and how do you go about starting to build a pipeline of business?
Jeffrey Bilbrey
Hey, Howard. I'm happy to say that I'm really optimistic about the opportunity in North America. However, I'm still an independent on the Board and haven't started yet. So it's a little bit difficult for me to answer that one with specificity. I think I had probably referred to Najeeb on that.
Howard Halpern
Okay.
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes, I think you know Jeff - Howard, Jeff will be fully up to speed and the earn call will be ready up and running a lot of senate for the North America business.
Howard Halpern
Okay. So one last one little while ago you announced collaboration with [EGO]. Could you - I guess just provide some insight and you are thinking behind that collaboration?
Najeeb Ghauri
Very exciting opportunity but let Naeem answer he is about who is done the deal.
Naeem Ghauri
Yes, EGO if you take on the website they provide 3D mapping into your and next year mapping. And they worry have few huge appliance. So essentially what we are trying to do is define and we have upon synergies on some of things we are doing with our clients as well as something which you’re going to look at in terms of diversification. So there is some complementary areas on what we are planning to build for our clients as well as things that which are probably new for us.

But there is one common denominator which is essentially our resource pull the talent that we have in Lahore is second to none. And so this is being leveraged and we have been able to leverage those resources to get a stake direct stake in EGO and so essentially when these products are market ready will be able to offer some of these or existing clients as well as going out to the mainstream market. And 3D mapping is kind of new space and very few players in that specially the interior mapping it’s quite hard of the moment. So we really excited on where this is going so far.
Howard Halpern
Okay. Guys keep up the great work.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thanks Howard.
Naeem Ghauri
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Mike Vermut of Newland Capital. Please go ahead.
Mike Vermut
Hi, guys great quarter there.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you.
Roger Almond
Thank you.
Mike Vermut
Question for here so as we look I don’t want to jump again, but looking out of the next few years. As the contract still this we built here in the U.S. and then Europe. And I remember the few call ago you said that our expense structure is pretty much intact until we get to that $85 million, $95 million, or $100 million range. When you did a great job on the expense side?
Is that the way we should be looking at here that’s for the leverage comes from that you are pretty set on the SG&A side and the leverage should really start to kick in as we move from the 62 to 70s to 80s and you don’t really need to add much more infrastructure up until that $90-ish million level?
Najeeb Ghauri
In addition to what you said companies already think making sure that we are much more efficient, much more productive and get the best quality from our [indiscernible] developers programmers and in one way you are right we’re not looking for any major developers or programmers hiring because we have enough scale and capability but at the same time we're making more strategic investment for example now Jeff is joining the company as a [indiscernible] executive help us, work on the U.S. market which is exactly our biggest market that we’ve yet to explore, when it comes to our NFS Ascent.
So I believe we are pretty comfortable with our cost structure and all of us, Naeem, myself and Roger making sure that if anything - hiring anymore and we don’t do some attrition where we get, we maintain the best quality of resources. At some point we also like to [indiscernible] but our focus is on building strong revenue growth.
And as Naeem said we are very busy on this implementation of so many deals. And the pipeline is strong, so we are very busy in delivering those project and same time we are working with the new project at the same time. So I think we will continue to improve our margins. You are seeing improvements last two quarters and I think we are quite committed to keep the cost in control. Naeem do you want to add some more.
Naeem Ghauri
Yes, look the numbers are telling the story because apart from some minor incremental cost because obviously the more projects you do, you have to put more project managers and so on - on a project. But I think from an infrastructure point of view we were all set. We have a good ramp up scale available with the facility in the Lahore without having to build anything big out.
So I think the only incremental cost I see potentially when we hit the $70 million, $80 million over the next few years, is essentially just maybe just those additional project managers and you know people at the very, very top in terms of development resource, in terms of very back-end resource, we have very good scale already.
Mike Vermut
Right. Is there any way to give us insight into that pipeline in the U.S., UK and Europe and how many of those discussions are with your current customers you know that are now looking to migrate to Ascent in the U.S. or in Europe. I think that makes it an easier.

sale for the company?
Naeem Ghauri
I can tell you things are extremely busy in Asia, Australia, Pacific. These three parts are extremely busy; we are stretched in terms of from sales perspective. We are extremely stressed trying to cover everything. So that's good news. In Europe, quite a few interesting opportunities just popped up, so pipeline is very healthy.
So Europe is slightly behind in terms of how they're tracking, but they’re certainly way ahead of where they were a year ago. So you like for example a year ago we were only talking with that one client, which we are implementing now but we are in talks with at least one more, which is quite mature. And hopefully will mature very fast.
And then, then there are others who have just dropped into the pipeline, two at least on a kind of medium stage and two or three early stage, so which is good news. Now in the U.S. we’ve got Jeff starting later this month and he's going to have a pretty busy you know schedule over the next two or three months because essentially one of the first things we are going to ask him to do is to go visit all our existing clients, which have shown interest in upgrading to Ascent.
Those discussions have happened in the past but now at the senior level, we have now got an NTA President I think there is changes the level of engagement and seniority. And these discussions start to get a bit more serious. So U.S. would be a little bit further behind. So this is how we're tracking.
Mike Vermut
So would we expect within the next year to have some real U.S. contacts or is it farther out from there?
Naeem Ghauri
It’s being your speculation Mike if I would say the next 12 months I would say certainly we - sales cycles are like nine months to maybe 18 months typically right. So I think I'm very confident that we'll be in a sales cycle or two for sure. In the next fiscal and how they mature and close within the fiscal year is anyone's guess, because we don't control the sales cycle, but I can tell you nine months to 18 months is a typical sales cycle and we already have a couple of good leads. And how they mature and track over the year, but certainly we don't - we cannot speculate on that.
Mike Vermut
And then another statement on that, what is the size of these deals in Europe, in the U.S. and what are the margin profiles of these verses Asian contracts?
Najeeb Ghauri
What's happening Mike is that we actually raise the bar now. In terms of the product mix that we now have, it's really just at a different level to what R1 NFS was. So we’re able to charge premium pricing for our resources that the people were selling at x before now we can sell it at x plus 40% or 50%. So that's a really big spike on the rates.
So that helps and then secondly we're also been asked to provide more and more of SaaS kind of pricing and SaaS is great for us, because that has recurring revenue and then longer-term contract and this is gone, so it's not so lumpy anymore.
So we're starting to build some SaaS interest as well and one of the - type of strong deals that we have in Europe are based on that models. So pricing definitely is premium compared to our old product set, but it will be a nice mix of both license as well as SaaS which is as you go monthly kind of rental.
Mike Vermut
And then last question and I’m not asking for a forecast or anything, but when you sit back and you look at the next three years because the scope of the contracts you have signed already is it much easier for you to see that - I'm going to make a 15%, 20% type growth going forward or is it still we need to fill these pockets or do you have that good setting on both the cost side, the revenue side and it's much easier for you to give a - to look at a three to five-year forecast for the company?

Roger Almond
So I wouldn’t go as far as the guidance or forecast, but it’s just under topline part. I don't think we should be putting it in the guidance kind of forecast, but I think what we would say is that our expectation is from a sales perspective that if we’re not hitting 15%, 20% year-on-year then we should be. So really that's what I tell my team that we need to show 15% to 20% growth every year, now that goes next year, or year or two after. I can’t go that far…
Najeeb Ghauri
We’ll keep over the annual guidance so I think let’s - what we talk in the year and about 2017 so pretty optimistic.
Mike Vermut
Okay. Well, congrats guys. This is a fantastic quarter.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thank you, Mike.
Roger Almond
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from John Serafini, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Good morning, gentleman. Wonderful job on this quarter. Couple of questions for you if you can I noticed in the press release, one of the bullet points talks about revenue - minimum revenue expectations, net revenue of $62 million for this fiscal year that we will conclude on the end of June and anticipated EPS of $1 a share. It seems wonderful to me. How do we get to that $1 a share? I know this quarter we have the non-GAAP metric at $0.30 per share, so how do we get to the $1?
Najeeb Ghauri
We already have $0.76 I believe for the nine months.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Najeeb Ghauri
But $0.37 for the Q3 and our EPS on a non-GAAP basis is $0.76.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So it’s regular…
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes. I think we look pretty healthy though and so there will be a record for us to have a dollar plus EPS on EBITDA basis.
Unidentified Analyst
It’s wonderful, so it’s standing achievement, really, but certainly as a shareholder I appreciate that I just was curious to see whether that’s how you are going to say that, so…
Najeeb Ghauri
We have a very strong [indiscernible] provider.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, you do. It does an excellent job for you, so we appreciate all the work that you do here. One other related - well I don't know if it's related but I know over time our strategy is to purchase more shares of the PK subsidiary and then now we are controlling now. Well the non-controlled shares are about 33%? What's the plan going forward will be we continue to accumulate shares in the subsidiary and eventually. Can you indicate in anyway what percentage you may end up with say over the next year?
Najeeb Ghauri
Yes, I think we did you’ve seen the reports and you will see the 10-Q detail of revenue the number should require. We did that in this quarter and our strategy is to continue that pattern because ideally in better owned more of it maybe all of it at some point - EPS so an eventually I think we will simplify the structure with sometime obviously of new things I going to understand the whole structure, but guide our plan and cash requirement cash are utilization and the best of the way. So that strategy is ongoing and keep the market posted with the next acquisitions of shares.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So we're going to stay on the path basically.
Najeeb Ghauri
It seem like.
Unidentified Analyst
Good. Good. Okay well those are my questions I appreciate again the good work and your forthright answers and we're all cheering you on - on the sidelines here and satisfy how well you're doing so far so. Keep up the good work and thank you.
Roger Almond
Thanks.
Najeeb Ghauri
Thanks. We have a great team here. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question will be a follow up from Mike Vermut of Newland Capital. Please go head.
Mike Vermut
I guys one follow up one I know a lot of the cash is overseas but you know trading at 25% free cash flow yield on your cash earnings here, trading at that what five times earnings 10 of unheard for software company in your growth trajectory. Is there point where you say as you get cash in the U.S. you start the buyback U.S. stock I just it’s hard to see evaluation staying at these levels for long?

Najeeb Ghauri
I think Mike, the question a minute ago about the buyback in peak issues. I believe and the board believe that probably is the priority number one in our strategy and that’s what we’ve done some shares $10 million and $0.5 million from selling. So that really will be in the long-term of better approach to have a better control and streamline the structure that with simple and anybody can reach of the line with straight profit is going to the bottom line in the minority interest taken out. So that will be - I think we will make much more sense. And if cash permits and we can do lot of the things to that are best for the company.
Mike Vermut
Great excellent. These Irish is don’t know the last long so it’s an opportunity, but great job, look at there?
Najeeb Ghauri
[Indiscernible]
Mike Vermut
Okay thanks.
Najeeb Ghauri

Biography


Najeeb Ghauri is the founder and chief executive of NetSol Technologies Inc., a Calabasas software company that makes a lot of its money from a program widely used in automobile leasing. Its customers include automakers Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan and Hyundai. The company also provides consulting and design services to companies worldwide. With more than 1,100 employees, NetSol reported a record $51 million in revenue for its recently completed fiscal year.
Born and reared in Pakistan, Ghauri longed to move to the United States to pursue an education and a better life. U.S. officials rejected his application for a student visa six times before relenting in 1977, when Ghauri was 22. He earned a bachelor's degree at Eastern Illinois University in 1979 and a master's degree in business administration from Claremont Graduate University in 1981. He spent 15 years in corporate jobs with Unilever, a British company, and Atlantic Richfield Co. before deciding he wanted to start his own business. He earned a bachelor's degree at Eastern Illinois University in 1979 and a master's degree in business. Although Ghauri was happy living in the United States, he knew there was something his homeland could offer: highly educated software engineers and information technology workers who are paid a fraction of those in the United States.

An Interview with WSJ: NetSol CEO Calls Pakistani Workforce a ‘Bright Spot’




With labor costs on the rise in China and India, companies searching for talent in the Asia-Pacific region may do well to look to Pakistan, Najeeb Ghauri, founder and CEO of NetSol, told CFO Journal.










Expensive dining, luxury for us but can feed hundreds of hungr people.




Imagine the cost of two people at a fancy restaurant would serve at least 60 people, for them it's not a luxury but a source of survival. "IT'S A MOVING EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SEE AND FEEL THE PAIN AND HUNGER OF THESE PEOPLE."

NetSol Technologies, Inc. (NTWK) CEO Najeeb Ghauri Provides Update on Corporate Business Developments
March 23, 2011


Netsol Technologies Inc., a leader in providing global business services and enterprise application solutions to various organizations around the world, announced a special update from CEO Najeeb Ghauri in regards to the company’s corporate business developments.
Mr. Ghauri, NetSol’s Chairman and CEO, stated: “We have seen a noticeable increase in activity within Pakistan’s public sector, and its health and private business sectors are also on the rise. As a premier IT company in Pakistan, NetSol has been invited as a pre-qualified company to tender offers for several new projects, and our business development teams are aggressively bidding for these contracts. We expect to periodically update our investors with material developments as we win these bids.”  
The Company’s management completed various purchases of NetSol’s stocks recently, which includes 500,000 shares that were obtained in February and March of 2011. Mr. Ghauri commented, “The management team has enhanced its ownership through open market buying and exercise of options, which is reflective of our long-term view and outlook. We exercise options both to improve our shareholdings and also to take advantage of unusually low stock valuation. Our intention is to continue to enhance our ownership, and we have no plans to sell any shares.”
“Our backlog from previous quarters is keeping our sales and delivery teams very busy in the current quarter,” Mr. Ghauri continued. “In addition, we have a number of exciting announcements in the pipeline, and we expect to be able to share several of them with our investors over the next several weeks.”
The company also recently announced its North American launch of LeasePak-SaaS, which is a subscription based lease and loan accounting and portfolio management system delivered via the software-as-a-service (SaaS) deployment model. 
NetSol’s LeasePak Enterprise finance management system has been used by global finance teams in banks, independents, and manufacturing captives for more than 25 years. Until now, the system has only been available as licensed software. However, with the launch of LeasePak-SaaS, the broad functionality of the LeasePak system now falls within the budgets of smaller companies, allowing them the flexibility to own the program. 
Commenting on the business benefits of the new offering, NetSol’s Chairman and CEO, Najeeb Ghauri, stated, “LeasePak-SaaS will enable equipment and vehicle finance organizations to eliminate the overhead of software licensing, installed systems, dedicated IT resources and desktop maintenance services. Now, finance managers can provide their teams with the many benefits of cloud computing with no compromise in the scalability, functionality, or end-to-end integration of their core portfolio management solution.”  
Mr. Ghauri continued, “The SaaS deployment option means that we can provide customers with as much technology as they need, scale their systems as they grow, and enable originators, accounting staff, and managers to use any computer, anywhere, at any time to securely access their information and track asset finance performance.”
NetSol Technologies, Inc. engages in the design and development of software products for the automobile finance and leasing, banking, healthcare, and financial services industries around the world. Additionally, the company offers business intelligence, independent system review, information security, and software process improvement consulting services; maintenance and support, as well as project management services. The company, formerly known as NetSol International Inc., changed its name to NetSol Technologies, Inc. in March of 2002. The company was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Calabasas, California.
