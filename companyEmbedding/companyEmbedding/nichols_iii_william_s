Nichols establish endowed professorship
Mays Business School, August 1st, 2005



Rebecca Upham Nichols ’74 and William S. Nichols III ’74Â of Houston have established an endowed professorship at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School. Their gift, which creates the Rebecca U. ’74 and William S. Nichols III ’74 Endowed Professorship, supports the teaching, research, service and professional development activities of a faculty member.
“Our outstanding faculty is one of the greatest assets we have at Mays,” said Dean Jerry Strawser. “The Nichols’ generous gift will enable us to recruit and retain the very best faculty, who create educational experiences that will continue to set our students apart from the competition.”
“It is my and Becky’s privilege to be part of the momentum that’s currently underway at Mays Business School,” William “Nick” Nichols said. “From our own experiences at Texas A&M, we know that outstanding faculty and students are the catalysts for any great program. We hope that our commitment will assist the Mays program in recruiting the very best faculty to Texas A&M.”
Nick, a CPA, graduated from Woodville High School in 1970 and was a member of the Corps of Cadets, unit A-1. He earned his BBA in accounting in 1974 and worked for Arthur Young and Co. until 1984, when he co-founded Houston-based Suncor Development, a commercial real estate development firm. He currently serves as president of Suncor.
Dr. Rebecca “Becky” Upham Nichols graduated from A&M Consolidated High School in 1970. She earned a bachelor’s in veterinary medicine from A&M in 1974 and a DVM in 1976. Becky co-founded Kingsland Blvd. Animal Clinic in 1981 and retired in 2004.
