Immigrant Entrepreneur Hall of Fame: Dr. George N. Hatsopoulos


 	
Country of origin: Greece
Year came to U.S.: mid-1940’s
Education: BS, MS, PhD Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Business: Thermo Fischer Scientific (1956)
Headquarters: Waltham, MA
2015 revenue: $17 billion
Worldwide employment: 52,400
Ranked 164 in 2016 Fortune 500
 

Thermo Electron Corporation was started in 1956 with $50,000. It became Thermo Fischer Scientific and had revenues of $17 billion in 2015.
The company’s first product, the thermionic energy converter, never made it to market.

 
George N. Hatsopoulos grew up in Nazi-occupied Greece. He admired Thomas Edison and wanted to emulate him as both an inventor and entrepreneur. As a teenager, he built and sold radios and transmitters, which were outlawed by the Nazis.
After the war, he came to the United States with a scholarship to study mechanical engineering at MIT. In 1956, Hatsopoulos finished his doctoral dissertation about his theoretical invention of an engine that converted heat directly into electricity without any moving parts called the “thermionic energy converter.” That same year, he and his brother John formed the Thermo Electron Corporation to commercialize his invention. They started the company in George’s living room and basement with $50,000 borrowed from a Greek ship owner.
The energy converter never came to fruition but the effort spawned a successful engineering company, which went on to become the largest analytical instrumentation company in the world. The innovative company has been referred to as a “perpetual idea machine.” From the beginning, Hatsopoulos saw the value in turning ideas into products and new businesses. His strategy was to make each promising technology the core of its own new subsidiary to encourage entrepreneurial activity.
Hatsopoulos retired as chairman of Thermo Electron in 2000 and remained an active board member. Thermo Electron Corporation acquired Fisher Scientific in 2006 and became Thermo Fisher Scientific.  The company now serves pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research Institutions, government agencies, and environmental and process control industries with a mission to “enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.”
Hatsopoulos kept academic ties as well as industrial. He served as a faculty member from 1956 to 1962 and senior lecturer until 1990 at MIT. His community service includes the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Securities and Exchange Commission Advisory Committee on Capital Formation and Regulatory Process, the Advisory Committee of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and the boards of many other corporations and institutions.

Early life[edit]
Hatsopoulos was born in Athens, Greece in 1927[1] and is related to[how?] the former rector of the Athens Polytechnic School, Nicolas Kitsikis. He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).[2]
Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamics[edit]
In 1965, he and Joseph Keenan published their textbook Principles of General Thermodynamics, which restates the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.[3] Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:



“
When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.
”



The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,[4] and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of entropy to the non-equilibrium domain.
In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.[5]
Overview[edit]
While at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of Matrad Corporation (New York).[2] Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, The Thermo-Electron Engine.[6] Matrad corporation was owned by the family of Peter M. Nomikos, a Harvard Business School graduate. In 1956, Nomikos co-founded with Hatsopoulos the Thermo Electron Corporation.[7] Thermo Electron became a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains under the development of George Hatsopoulos, John Hatsopoulos, and Arvin Smith.[8] In 1965, George Hatsopoulos was president of the Thermo Electron Engineering Corporation and Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T..
In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the John Fritz Medal, which is the highest American award in the engineering profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.[9] Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 2011, along with Arvin Smith and John Hatsopoulos, he was awarded the 2011 Pittcon Heritage Award from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

Page Content 1George Hatsopoulos
George founded Thermo Electron in 1956 because he wanted to create a company that would foster innovation and allow outstanding engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs to apply technology to emerging societal needs. 
Since then, Thermo Electron has grown into an international company recognized as a world leader in environmental monitoring and analysis instruments and a major producer of paper-recycling equipment, biomedical products, alternative-energy systems, and other products and services related to environmental quality, health, and safety. 
Dr. Hatsopoulous' training began in his native Greece at the National Technical University of Athens and continued at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received his bachelor’s (1949), master’s (1950), engineer’s (1954), and doctorate (1956) degrees all in mechanical engineering. In addition to his work at Thermo Electron, Dr. Hatsopoulos has testified at numerous congressional hearings on national energy policy and capital formation, and has served on many national committees on energy conservation, environmental protection, and international exchange.

He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).[2]Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamicsIn 1965, he and Joseph Keenan published their textbook Principles of General Thermodynamics, which restates the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.[3] Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:“When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.”The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,[4] and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of entropy to the non-equilibrium domain.In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.[5]OverviewWhile at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of Matrad Corporation (New York).[2] Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, The Thermo-Electron Engine.[6] Matrad corporation was owned by the family of Peter M. Nomikos, a Harvard Business School graduate. In 1956, Nomikos co-founded with Hatsopoulos the Thermo Electron Corporation.[7] Thermo Electron became a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains under the development of George Hatsopoulos, John Hatsopoulos, and Arvin Smith.[8] In 1965, George Hatsopoulos was president of the Thermo Electron Engineering Corporation and Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T..In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the John Fritz Medal, which is the highest American award in the engineering profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.[9] Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 2011, along with Arvin Smith and John Hatsopoulos, he was awarded the 2011 Pittcon Heritage Award from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.See alsoHistory of thermodynamicsReferences^ [1]^ a b MIT.

George Hatsopoulos
Dr. George N. Hatsopoulos receives the Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment for his development of the thermionic converter and his innovative methods of creating new technology-based enterprises.

As a teen-ager in Nazi-occupied Greece, Dr. Hatsopoulos built and sold illegal radios and transmitters. Later, as a young man, he won a scholarship to MIT to study mechanical engineering with the goal of becoming both an inventor and a businessman. Forty years later, in an age focused on core competencies, his company, Thermo Electron Corporation, is a pacesetter eager to experiment with new technologies and build new subsidiaries around them. Dr. Hatsopoulos transformed a once small laboratory into a world leader in environmental monitoring, biomedical manufacturing and many other specialized products and technologies. The company employs over 17,000 people and has annual sales of $3 billion.

"You can't be enamored with technology," Dr. Hatsopoulos has said. "You must instead be driven by the needs of the marketplace." That pragmatic philosophy has been a useful guide to the founder and now Chief Executive Officer of the Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Electron Corporation.

Dr. Hatsopoulos' success began when he devised a theoretical engine that converted heat directly into electricity without using any moving parts. His thermionic converter, the first in an impressive string of technological innovations, became the catalyst for the creation of a company that is today an international leader in manufacturing. Based on an ever-increasing number of ideas and technologies coming from Thermo Electron, the company is often referred to as a "perpetual idea machine." Dr. Hatsopoulos sees those ideas not just as new products, but also as seeds for new businesses. He developed a strategy to make each new technology the core of its own new subsidiary, armed with the flexibility and resources to explore further innovation.

Thermo Electron is now parent to 18 of these "spin-out" companies, all designed to motivate entrepreneurship. Thermo Electron is careful to explain that it spins out, not spins off, its companies. The company always retains a majority stake in each new endeavor and offers its new stock to the public and not to existing shareholders. The corporate parent then continues to provide strategic planning, employee benefits and pension fund management, executive recruiting and other internal administration services, thus freeing up the subsidiary to focus on innovation and market needs.

Dr. Hatsopoulos' formula for success is really very simple. He seeks to anticipate society's problems, develop the technology to solve them, and have the product on line in time to meet the need. But it is in his implementation of that formula that he stands apart as a business leader. In creating a new corporate structure, he has discovered a way to sustain growth in today's rapidly changing world markets.
Note: This profile is excerpted from the commemorative brochure published at the time of the awards' presentation.

UPDATES SINCE RECEIVING THE HEINZ AWARD
May 2006 - Thermo Electron Corporation acquired Fisher Scientific and became Thermo Fisher Scientific, making it one of the most important life science corporations in Massachusetts, employing 30,000 and having a stock market value of $15.5 billion. - The Boston Globe
October 2005 - George Hatsopoulos is still "thinking big" at 78 as he builds another company, Pharos, into a billion-dollar success. Pharos has two divisions - one that develops blood pumps and the other that develops semiconductors. - The Boston Globe
September 2000 - Hatsopoulos announces that he is retiring from his position as director of the Photoelectron Corporation, the group he has led since its founding in 1989.
March 2000 - Hatsopoulos is inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs. He and the other 73 inductees for 2000 were chosen "for their willingness to take risks and to invest capital and energy into ventures that made positive contributions to society." - AScribe Newswire
December 1999 - Hatsopoulos announces that he will retire as chairman of Thermo Electron Corporation as of January 1. Thermo Electron is the company that Hatsopoulos launched in 1956, and while he will step down as CEO, he plans to "continue as a corporate director and remain active" in the company. - The Boston Globe

Early life[edit]
Hatsopoulos was born in Athens, Greece in 1927[1] and is related to[how?] the former rector of the Athens Polytechnic School, Nicolas Kitsikis. He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).[2]
Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamics[edit]
In 1965, he and Joseph Keenan published their textbook Principles of General Thermodynamics, which restates the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.[3] Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:



“
When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.
”



The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,[4] and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of entropy to the non-equilibrium domain.
In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.[5]
Overview[edit]
While at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of Matrad Corporation (New York).[2] Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, The Thermo-Electron Engine.[6] Matrad corporation was owned by the family of Peter M. Nomikos, a Harvard Business School graduate. In 1956, Nomikos co-founded with Hatsopoulos the Thermo Electron Corporation.[7] Thermo Electron became a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains under the development of George Hatsopoulos, John Hatsopoulos, and Arvin Smith.[8] In 1965, George Hatsopoulos was president of the Thermo Electron Engineering Corporation and Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T..
In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the John Fritz Medal, which is the highest American award in the engineering profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.[9] Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 2011, along with Arvin Smith and John Hatsopoulos, he was awarded the 2011 Pittcon Heritage Award from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

Early life[edit]
Hatsopoulos was born in Athens, Greece in 1927[1] and is related to[how?] the former rector of the Athens Polytechnic School, Nicolas Kitsikis. He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).[2]
Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamics[edit]
In 1965, he and Joseph Keenan published their textbook Principles of General Thermodynamics, which restates the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.[3] Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:



“
When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.
”



The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,[4] and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of entropy to the non-equilibrium domain.
In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.[5]
Overview[edit]
While at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of Matrad Corporation (New York).[2] Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, The Thermo-Electron Engine.[6] Matrad corporation was owned by the family of Peter M. Nomikos, a Harvard Business School graduate. In 1956, Nomikos co-founded with Hatsopoulos the Thermo Electron Corporation.[7] Thermo Electron became a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains under the development of George Hatsopoulos, John Hatsopoulos, and Arvin Smith.[8] In 1965, George Hatsopoulos was president of the Thermo Electron Engineering Corporation and Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T..
In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the John Fritz Medal, which is the highest American award in the engineering profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.[9] Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 2011, along with Arvin Smith and John Hatsopoulos, he was awarded the 2011 Pittcon Heritage Award from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
