Mark Knights







﻿














Mark Knights is a member of the Government Investigations & White Collar Defense practice group, where he represents individuals and businesses across a variety of industries in connection with matters involving the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and other federal and state laws.

Prior to joining Nixon Peabody, Mark served as a law clerk for Judge Mary Beck Briscoe of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and Chief Judge Joseph Laplante of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, and was an associate at Goodwin, where he focused on general commercial litigation. What do you focus on? My practice encompasses a broad range of complex criminal and civil matters. I provide guidance to individual and institutional clients at all stages of state and federal government investigations, prosecutions and enforcement actions. I help businesses mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution by designing and implementing strategies to prevent—and, if necessary, detect and remedy—wrongdoing by employees. Among other things, I have represented a major technology company faced with a Korean government investigation into alleged theft of trade secrets, a major financial services firm targeted in a civil investigation into alleged fair lending violations by the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, a large manufacturer of highway safety products in a federal investigation into allegations of false claims to the Federal Highway Administration, and a large professional services firm subpoenaed by the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office in a public corruption investigation. On the civil side, I represent both plaintiffs and defendants in a number of commercial litigation matters. I have extensive experience defending against putative class actions, and previously represented a major national bank in a multi-district federal litigation comprised of over 30 different consolidated class actions. In another, vigorously defended intellectual property action, I helped a large manufacturer obtain a multimillion dollar settlement from a competitor. What do you see on the horizon? State governments are under more financial pressure now than ever before. In pursuit of alternative streams of revenue, state attorneys general and regulatory agencies will aggressively pursue criminal and civil enforcement actions that carry the risk of large fines and financial penalties. At the federal level, we will continue to see prosecutors apply close scrutiny to companies operating in the highly regulated fields of health care, pharmaceuticals and financial services, and they will increasingly employ an array of civil enforcement mechanisms as well. In this environment, it is crucial for businesses to retain experienced counsel to assist them in swiftly responding to both criminal and civil investigations.

Peabody Energy - Death Of The Junk Bond Market As We Know It - Peabody Energy Corp. (NYSE:BTU) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Peabody Energy - Death Of The Junk Bond Market As We Know ItMar. 7.17 | About: Peabody Energy (BTU) Mark Gottlieb Value, bonds, activist investor, contrarianMark GottiebSummaryI originally thought this was the story about Peabody Energy leading up to the confirmation hearing of its reorganization on 3/16/17.The more I think about it, I see it is about the future of junk bond market participation.How can you model recoveries of bonds in a bankruptcy scenario when recovery isn't based on reality and is determined by plan architects solely for their benefit?I originally planned to write a piece on all the events leading up to the Peabody Energy (BTUUQ) reorganization hearing on 3/16/17. The more I think about it, the more I realize the story is much more than a Peabody Energy story. It is about the future existence of junk bond market participation. Sophisticated institutional and retail investors attempt to model recoveries of their bonds in a bankruptcy scenario. HOW DO YOU DO THAT when the recovery is now primarily determined by plan architecture negotiated confidentially (favoring plan proponents), bearing almost no reflection of asset and balance sheet figures which models are customarily based upon. This is what happened with Peabody Energy. Doesn't this totally destroy the junk bond markets as they currently exist? Proponents can't own all the bonds of every single distressed company, the wider investor community is needed for the market to function effectively. This would be the first time holders of identical securities get different recovery in U.S. bankruptcy law history. I challenge any readers of this to cite a similar example. Peabody Energy is the world's largest private-sector coal company. Here is the Peabody Energy story leading up to the March 16th confirmation hearing. Peabody Energy filed chapter 11 in 4/16. Peabody Energy rode the wave to higher profits in late 2016 as coal prices soared and Donald Trump who is pro-coal was elected president. Peabody Energy subordinated debt reached .79 in 12/16. Peabody Energy filed a reorganization plan in late 12/16 which benefited the senior management team and the co-proponents at the expense of everyone else. Co-proponents are led by billionaire Paul Singer of Elliott Management.
 Peabody Energy could have easily avoided chapter 11. Fred Palmer is a former Peabody Energy executive who explained why Peabody's debt could have been reinstated and shareholders didn't need to be wiped out. An Australian investor spoke about Peabody's management rebuffing prized asset sales in Australia. Bankruptcy Judge Schermer denied an equity committee. The court was presented with an alternative plan that was fair and equitable to all. The judge is currently only giving consideration to the reorganization plan, not the alternative plan. WYCO Researcher wrote an excellent analysis on the alternative plan in this article of his. Restructuring advisory firm expert Mark Hootnick showed in court just how unfair the current plan is to non co-proponents. See Exhibit C: Co-Proponents (Initial parties) are 40% of unsecured creditor claims and (per debtor plan) would get 57% of new equity Non-participants (retail) are 10% of unsecured creditor claims and (per debtor plan) would get <1% of new equity The bankruptcy judge approved not only the disclosure statement, but also other motions including Private Placement Agreement, backstop agreement, Plan Support Agreement, rights offering and the break-up fees. This approval was despite strong objections from various stakeholders. The plan includes a voting and rights offering portion and was purposely very confusing to limit participation from retail investors, in my opinion. WYCO Researcher weighed in on this Terrible News for Peabody Investors. Here is a link below to a letter from a Joel Packer and his hearing in an attempt to form a committee of retail noteholders. It was denied and he is appealing. There is major discrimination going on in this situation with the funds led by Elliott Management, Discovery Capital Management and Aurelius Capital Management getting phase 1 parties % of principal amount of 48.8% vs. Non-PSA Parties 5.9% for the identical bond if their Peabody Energy reorg plan is approved. It is my understanding if this plan is approved by the bankruptcy court it will be a first for approval of a reorg plan with this discrimination. I can see retail investors getting a recovery of .06 on the dollar, while the funds get $1.00 to $1.50 for the exact bond just in a different class the funds created. The funds stand to earn billions which would be coming from often devastating losses of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars on the exact same bond. The $1.00 to $1.50 also takes into account the funds unlike retail investors would get to buy more shares at highly discounted prices and purposely low valuations which retail investors cannot.
 When Peabody previously had 2017-level EBITDA ($1B) like today, Enterprise Value was $10B (2012) - compared to the plan proponents' "negotiated" plan enterprise value of $4.275B. The bonds would be near par had they not filed chapter 11 which could have been avoided. Retail bids on Peabody Energy unsecured bonds collapsed - two weeks ago at Fidelity - there was a bid of 20 cents. A week ago on both the 2018 and 2020s - there were two identical bids for both - 7 cents and 4 cents "cover." Meanwhile also a week ago, a Phase 1,2,3 institutional trade went across at 44 cents. I contacted the SEC about irregular trading in Peabody Energy bonds and other matters but it fell on deaf ears. This document was an attempt at discovery in the Peabody Energy trial. The Hedge Funds and Debtors were trying to black box the entire process and succeeded... it sets a really bad precedent / allows all sorts of fraud to happen in this and future cases. Hear the outcome in court. The co-proponents are doing all they can to limit participation in the rights offering on their plan. They can get the shares that others can't get at a deep discount. That is the obvious intent of everything which limited participation, including a short 3-day Christmas deadline for the PSA agreement. Thus far, Judge Schermer (the judge in the Peabody Energy case) has denied an equity committee, approved the disclosure statement, denied a retail noteholder committee and denied Discovery requests. Bondholders received very confusing solicitation packages with terms that only benefit the funds. Hopefully, if the retail class votes it down retail noteholders will get to vote on a non-discriminatory alternative. March 16 is the confirmation hearing day of the reorganization plan. If the judge confirms the plan which was written by the debtors for their benefit and the benefit of the Peabody Energy senior management team at the expense of everyone else, I believe this will mark the first time in history the U.S. Court would approve a discriminatory reorganization plan, whereby holders of identical securities get different recoveries. This either will be a day of justice in the court or a sad precedent for the future direction of the US Court System.
 I own $130,000 face value of Peabody Energy subordinated bonds maturing in 2018 and 2020 and $47,000 face value of Peabody Energy convertible bonds maturing in 2066.

Dear Friends,

When A.J. Amatuzio introduced AMSOIL Synthetic Motor Oil in 1972 – the first synthetic motor oil in the world to meet American Petroleum Institute service requirements – it set all new standards for motor oil quality. Amsoil synthetic lubricants outperformed conventional petroleum lubricants in every category. It was clear from the start that this innovative product would play a major role in engine performance and engine life.
Today, virtually every other oil manufacturer has recognized the superiority of synthetic lubricants and has followed the Amsoil lead with introductions of their own synthetics. They spend millions of dollars advertising their “new” and “revolutionary” products. But no one, however, can match Amsoil experience and technological expertise. And no one delivers the high caliber products like Amsoil.
Amsoil is “The First in Synthetics” – Accept no substitutes.

First – API rated 100 percent synthetic motor oil.
First – to introduce the concept of “extended drain intervals” with a recommended 25,000 mile/12 month drain interval.
First – to manufacture synthetic gear lube for automotive use.
First – to produce synthetic motor oils for diesel engines, racing engines, turbo-chargers, and marine engines.
First – to introduce synthetic oils that legitimately contribute to fuel efficiency.
First – to manufacture a 100:1 pre-mix synthetic 2-cycle oil.
First – to manufacture synthetic automatic transmission fluid for automotive use.
First – US company to use the NOACK volatility test as a standard of oil performance excellence.

I am the largest stocking Amsoil dealer in the south metro area. The Amsoil in stock varies with ongoing sales, so an initial contact is recommended.
