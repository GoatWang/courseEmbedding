                              The Research and Development Center for Teacher Education, Texas, and the Jefferson County Public Schools, Colorado, worked
                                 in mutally supportive ways between 1976 and 1982. The r&d center needed a site where they could collect longitudinal data
                                 about the implementation of an innovation using the concepts Stages of Concern (SoC) and Levels of Use (LoU) that were part
                                 of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (cbam). In the school district, a revision of the elemenatary science program in grades
                                 3-6 was to be adopted by all schools in the district. The district worked to implement the program in 76 elementary schools
                                 and a subset of 21 schools in which the researchers systematically studied the process. During the first 3 years the study
                                 focused on teachers as beginning innovation users, and during the next 2 years it focused on the role of principals as change
                                 facilitators. The findings indicate staff development and implementation support should begin with more emphasis on the "how
                                 to do its" and delay concentrated presentations of theory for more experienced users. In addition, the utility of the two
                                 concepts for planning and facilitating implementation were demonstrated. (Mlf)

                              To learn the extent to which a revised elementary science program for grades 3 to 6 had been implemented in the 81 elementary
                                 schools of the Jefferson County (Colorado) School District, program developers adopted an assessment system based on the innovation
                                 configurations concept. The evolution of this system into an ongoing program for instructional improvement is described in
                                 this report. The first stage in the evolution consisted of the collection of data concerning the degree of implementation
                                 of identified components of the new program in several randomly selected schools. In the second stage the program developers
                                 involved the building principals in the sampled schools in the implementation process, obtaining dramatic increases in implementation
                                 levels. The final stage consisted of refining the processes developed in the first two stages to accommodate the needs and
                                 concerns expressed by principals, teachers, and administrators. This report concludes with a discussion of the elements of
                                 the instructional improvement plan thus developed, and a comparison of these elements with the components of the innovation
                                 configurations approach. (Pgd)

                              Recently the framework of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model was used to guide the implementation of a revised elementary science
                                 program in grades 3-6 in the Jefferson County (Colorado) Public Schools. This paper explores how student achievement on a
                                 locally developed, criterion-referenced test is related to the length of time the revised science program has been in use.
                                 Three groups of students drawn from schools in three phases of the implementation were identified based on reading scores.
                                 The data indicate a definite trend toward increased student achievement in those classrooms where the innovation had been
                                 implemented for a longer time period. (Author/MLF)

                              This paper reports on two comprehensive multi-institutional collaborative efforts for school improvement. The two studies
                                 demonstrate that collaborative efforts involving multiple agencies and multiple agendas can be successful even when separated
                                 by considerable geographical distance. The school systems were concerned with implementing a locally developed curriculum;
                                 researchers, meanwhile, were investigating the implementation process and providing training. The conceptual framework used
                                 in both programs, the Concerns Based Adoption Model (cbam), is summarized. Its diagnostic dimensions (Stages of Concern about
                                 the Innovation, Levels of Use of the Innovation, and Innovation Configuration) are discussed. The planning, implementation,
                                 and evaluation of the two case studies are summarized: the Jefferson County (JeffCo) (Colorado) Schools program to improve
                                 elementary science curriculum and instruction; and the Palm Beach (Florida) Schools development and implementation of the
                                 Unified Curriculum program. The JeffCo case provides a clear example of a concerns-based implementation effort and illustrates
                                 how the diagnostic dimensions of the cbam can be used to plan, monitor, and intervene in improvement efforts. Addressing teacher
                                 concerns is emphasized. The Palm Beach study emphasizes principal inservice training for the role of implementaion facilitation.
                                 The collaboration of research teams from schools mentioned above and from the Research and Development Center for Teacher
                                 Education at the University of Texas at Austin led to the formulation of seven key principles for school improvement; six
                                 important unresolved issues are also presented. (Bs)
