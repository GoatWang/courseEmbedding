FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Why lease with Rice Energy
Entrusting the right operator to responsibly develop your oil and gas may be one of the most important decisions you make as a landowner. At Rice Energy, we realize that this decision takes time, and requires a strong understanding of our company’s commitment to safe and responsible development.
As corporate citizens of the communities in which we operate, Rice Energy works every day to maintain a trusted, long-term relationship by operating in a way that promotes high health, safety and environmental standards for our employees, landowners, and surrounding residents. Our goal is to build long-lasting landowner and stakeholder relationships simply by treating our landowners as trusted partners.


If you own oil and gas rights and are interested in learning more about leasing with Rice Energy, please click here to submit your name, parcel number(s) and contact information.
At Rice Energy, we are committed to working one-on-one with landowners to responsibly develop our region’s vast deposits of natural gas. To ensure that we safely and compliantly pursue this endeavor, we employ high standards of environmental stewardship and financial discipline. Our goal is to ensure that our landowners, stakeholders and the surrounding community have an opportunity to capitalize on our efficient growth strategy and ability to drill wells for long-term production.
Landowners interested in becoming partners with Rice Energy must sign a mineral lease. A mineral lease is a legally binding contract that gives Rice Energy the right to extract and produce a mineral owner’s natural gas. Once a lease is signed, Rice Energy will conduct a title search to confirm mineral ownership. In some cases, property or land ownership does not reflect mineral ownership.

Once ownership of oil and gas is confirmed, signed landowners are referred to as “lessors”. Lessors typically receive an initial bonus payment for an amount agreed upon during the signing of the lease. Lessors also have the opportunity to receive recurring royalty payments based on a percentage of a well’s production, which is also agreed upon at lease signing. Once a well begins producing, the lease is generally in effect for the life of the well.












How we compensate you
Bonus payments
A bonus payment is a one-time payment made to lessors whose ownership of oil and gas is confirmed by a title search conducted by Rice Energy. Bonus payments are typically made 3-5 months after lease signing and confirmation of ownership.
Royalty checks
Monthly checks for oil and natural gas royalties are mailed to unitized landowners who share an interest in a producing well. These payments are issued 60 days following the end of the production month. For example, checks earned for March production will be received mid-June.
Checks are generated on a monthly basis for accounts totaling $50 or more. For account balances below $50, checks are issued at the end of each year, generally on or around December 31.
If you have questions about your royalty check, please contact us.
Temporarily withheld payment
Payments are occasionally temporarily withheld when Rice Energy receives notice of a change in ownership, such as a notice of death, change of address, transfer of property, assignment of interest or legal dispute. In instances such as these, payments are accrued and released once all necessary documentation has been completed. If you have questions regarding suspended balances, please contact us.












Direct Deposit
Landowners who are actively receiving royalties from Rice Energy are now able to enroll in our recently launched electronic funds transfer program, otherwise known as direct deposit. EFT is a fast and secure method of payment that will automatically deposit royalty payments into a designated bank account each month. Landowners who choose to enroll will continue to receive a detailed royalty remittance statement by their choice of either mail or email. The advantages of electronic payments include secure payment processing, timely deposit, prompt email notification when payments are issued, and remittance statements that are sent immediately to a designated email account.
If you are interested in receiving electronic payments, you will be required to submit registration information that is necessary to process your royalty payments electronically. Two methods of enrollment are offered:

Online: To enroll electronically, please visit www.riceenergy.com/directdeposit. You will be directed to a page that will allow you to enter all required enrollment information safely and securely. Online enrollment is the fastest way to sign up for electronic payments!
Mail: To enroll by mail, please complete the Direct Deposit Enrollment Form. Send this form and a voided check to the following address:
ATTN: TREASURY DEPARTMENT
RICE ENERGY
2200 RICE DRIVE
CANONSBURG, PA 15317

Before electronic payments can be issued, we are required to issue our first payments from Wells Fargo via paper check. This will occur with February 2016 royalty issuances and will continue until you have been successfully enrolled in the electronic payment program. Due to anticipated high enrollment volume, please allow one to two royalty cycles for your enrollment to be validated.












Hear from our neighbors
“Our family has lived and farmed in this valley in Washington County for almost 70 years. We have always enjoyed a quiet and peaceful rural environment. We had concern for that environment when Marcellus Shale development began 4 years ago. We are happy to report that we have been very satisfied with the respect that Rice Energy has shown for the beauty of the valley and for its residents. Any disruption that occurred has been quickly remedied and repaired.
Pat O’Brien, Washington County 
“Rice is a family owned business. They act and talk just like one of us. It’s not like at a big company where the landowner is just a number.”
– Enon, OH 
They are very friendly, very personal, down to earth. They’re a big oil and gas company and I’m just a normal person, but they treat me like I’m on the same latitude as they are.
– Jerusalem, OH 
“They just seem to be a down home type of operation. They make you feel comfortable, you feel relaxed being with them or around them. They don’t make you feel like you’re just a nobody or someone off the street. I can only speak for me, but I don’t feel that way.”
– Jacobsburg, OH 
“They’re more of a family owned company than a huge corporation. I don’t get the corporate mentality from them that you get from some other companies.”
– St. Clairsville, OH 
“Rice is like a big family. They are family oriented, not this huge company. They’re friendlier people; they’re down to earth. They’ll sit and talk to you–it just seems like they care about you more than other companies.”
– Greene County, PA 












While in your neighborhood
Rice Energy partners with the communities in which we operate to achieve mutual benefits that will last for decades. Through open communications with our neighbors, local governments and regulatory agencies, we strive to educate the community at large about our operational standards and requirements. While working in your neighborhood, we are incorporating the most advanced technology to ensure we protect the long-term viability of our region’s natural gas resources. We are committed to safe and responsible development, and take seriously any concerns you may have regarding your personal property, water resources and the safety of your community. We know that permission to operate in your area depends on our ability to do business responsibly, and we intend to eliminate any doubt that we are the most trustworthy operator in the region.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Where we operate
Rice Energy’s leasehold position is concentrated in southwest Pennsylvania and southeastern Ohio. These regions are highly prospective for the Marcellus Shale, the Utica Shale and the Upper Devonian Shale.
Pennsylvania:
Rice Energy controls approximately 176,000 net acres in southwestern Pennsylvania and is actively developing the Marcellus Shale, Upper Devonian Shale and the Utica Shale. Rice Energy is a top 20 producer, by volume, of the Marcellus Shale
in Pennsylvania.
Rice Midstream Partners (NYSE: RMP), an affiliate of Rice Energy, provides gas gathering, compression and other midstream services to Rice Energy and other producers in southwestern Pennsylvania.
Ohio:
Rice Energy controls approximately 59,000 net acres in southeastern Ohio, primarily in Belmont County where it is actively developing the Utica Shale.

Safety & Environmental compliance

As a leading producer in the Marcellus and Utica shales with record-breaking exploration and production programs, the Rice Energy team takes its license to operate very seriously. Our commitment to the safety of our people and the environment
is at the core of everything we do. The health and welfare of our employees, contractors and communities depends on it.

like traffic.
How we address traffic:

or caught driving on a road where industry vehicles are prohibited, Rice Energy issues a citation to that person. A second citation is grounds for being banned from Rice Energy worksites for life.
Water Pipelines to Reduce Truck Traffic: By investing in state-of-the-art water pipelines capable of addressing the water needs of our completions operations, Rice Energy is able to reduce the amount of truck traffic in our
communities by approximately 2,000 truckloads per well.
Our on-site safety:
In-Field Safety Representatives 24/7: Rice Energy has trained safety representatives in the field 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to ensure the safety of our operations.
Protecting the environment:
Water Recycling – Rice Energy recycles over 80 percent of its flow back water.
Well Pad Lining and Mats – Rice Energy uses a unique system of liners and mats to form a protective “tray” on every well pad that can be easily cleaned and maintained throughout the life of the operation.
Rice Energy Safety Website:
Rice Energy has officially launched a web site that allows vendors to take safety tests online. This website also displays other content to help communicate information to vendors much quicker. Click here to launch the site Rice Energy Environmental Health & Safety Website

Frequently Asked Questions
Leasing:

Q. How do I lease my oil and gas to Rice Energy?
A. Please contact us via our Community & Landowner Hotline at 1-855-BLU-TEAM (1-855-258-8326) or www.RiceEnergy.com/contact to inquire about leasing your oil and gas to Rice Energy. When you call, be sure to have your parcel number and contact information ready.

Payment:

Q. How will I know when my property will be unitized or drilled?
A. Rice Energy notifies landowners of unitization via a division order statement. This will be mailed to your home prior to the collection of royalty payments.


Q. When will I be paid royalties?
A. Royalties are paid to landowners whose parcels are leased with Rice Energy and are in production. Royalty checks are issued 60 days following the end of the production month. (For example, checks earned for March production will be received mid-June.) Checks are generated on a monthly basis for accounts totaling $50 or more. For account balances below $50, checks are issued at the end of each year, generally on or around December 31.


Q. Why does Rice Energy need my Social Security and tax identification number?
A. Without a Social Security or tax identification number, your bonus/royalty payments will be subject to a non-refundable, 28% withholding under IRS regulations.


Q. Will you reissue a check if I don’t deposit it within the deadline?
A. Yes. If lost, contact the Community & Landowner Hotline at 1-855-BLU-TEAM (1-855-258-8326)


Q. Why is a backup witholding deducted from my check?
A. The IRS requires that Rice Energy obtain the Social Security or tax identification number of all payees. Without this identification, your payments will be subject to a non-refundable, 28% withholding under IRS regulations.


Q. How do I contact Rice Energy regarding questions about payment?
A. Rice Energy is pleased to address payment-related questions in the following ways: (1) If you prefer to call for assistance, please contact us via our Community & Landowner Hotline at 1-855-BLU-TEAM 1-855-258-8326. (2) If you prefer to write, please contact us at www.RiceEnergy.com/contact . When you write, be sure to include your owner number and parcel ID.

Account Updates:

Q. How do I change my address?
A. Please notify Rice Energy in writing or online if your mailing address changes. Include your owner number, your old and new address, as well as the last four digits of your Social Security number. For your protection and privacy, Rice Energy will not accept address changes via telephone or without the required information listed above.


Q. How do I determine what documents are required to change the ownership status of my property?
A. Landowners are encouraged to utilize the Ownership Reference Guide to find a list of the documentation needed to update your account information in the event of an address change, name change, divorce, death, bankruptcy or sale of oil and gas interest.


Q. What if I have a question that is not addressed here?
A. Please contact Rice Energy’s Community & Landowner Hotline at 1-855-BLU-TEAM A. (1-855-258-8326)

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
