							GV Financial Advisors is now JOYN						
On Thursday, November 17, we were thrilled to host more than 350 guests at our “top secret” event at the Foundry at Puritan Mill. Our guests had no idea what we had planned — other that we were going to change lives and that they’d want pictures. By the end of the evening, they built about 100 prosthetic hands for land mine victims in developing countries. And the pictures are still coming in.
We also announced our new name, JOYN.

THE EVENT

													WELCOME TO A NEW ERA													

													FAR BEYOND FINANCE													

													When it comes to money and decisions under stress, we humans aren’t always rational. That’s why Behavioral Wealth Management goes far beyond finance to incorporate new expertise in the biology of stress & decisions, the complexities of major life events, and our passion for the human factor. Because a traditional financial plan by itself isn’t enough for this new era.													

How We Work With You



















											Investing Philosophy											

											INNOVATIVELY CONVENTIONAL											

											When it comes to investing, we’ve built a disciplined approach to the tried-and-true. Yet our underlying philosophies are products of our team’s innovation, application of behavioral science, and passion for the human factor.

The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at GV Financial (Atlanta, GA) in September 2016.InterviewI had a phone screen with the HR Assistant (He was pleasant).They then requested a face-to-face interview (which they ask for one to schedule a two hour slot). In this interview I met again with the HR Assistant, answered questions, and took a test. He stated that I would still need to meet with the hiring manager, but she had already left for the day. He also stated I would have one more face-to-face interview with multiple management members. After both face-to-face interviews they would then make a decision on whether or not to make a job offer.Although I wasn't particularly looking for employment opportunities, I talked to a recruiter at a school event on a Friday and was reached by the same recruiter on Monday requesting a Phone Screen. I was then called within a few days after the phone screen to schedule the face-to-face interview. I was not selected for the position, but did wish to receive some feedback on what skills they found I could attain or improve. I am a Finance Major and, being that it is a financial company, I was interested in knowing what I could improve on. Unfortunately, they did not respond after I was sent notice of not being selected. It's not a big deal, BUT after a lengthy interview process, I hoped they could've at least provided some sort of feedback along with the decision.Interview Questions They asked basic questions over skill sets and level of expertise. They also asked questions like "what are three areas of your skill set that need improvement." I found their questions were formed to find out more of one's weak points rather than discussing strong attributes and skills.

										CONNECT
										






With over 20 years of experience, Marc is a partner, senior financial advisor, and CEO of Strategic Liquidity Services (“SLS”) at JOYN. SLS provides a methodology designed to help business owners navigate the complex options available for generating liquidity from their businesses.

“Most business owners think there’s one way to generate liquidity from their business — to sell it,” Marc explains. “However, that’s one of many options, and in our experience, it’s often not the best one. We help people navigate complex variables so they can choose a path that best fits with their personal and professional goals.”
Lewyn graduated cum laude from the University of Virginia and received his law degree from the University of Georgia School of Law. Prior to joining JOYN, Marc served as a corporate attorney for a variety of business clients. Marc also had the privilege of working on the staff of a U.S. Senator, a job he credits for giving him the willingness to tackle a variety of complex problems in service to others.

A leader in the community, Marc enjoys sharing his time and expertise with a number of Atlanta-based charities and organizations. Marc is a former member of the Emory University Board of Visitors, a past Chair of the Endowment Fund of the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, and served on the Executive Committee and the Board of that organization for many years. He served on the Endowment Board of the Westminster Schools, the Boards of the Atlanta Jewish Academy, and the Endowment Committee of the Community Foundation of Greater Atlanta. He and his wife Bev were the honorees for the Atlanta Scholars Kollel Tribute dinner in 2013. Other honorees have included Bernie Marcus, former CEO and co-founder of The Home Depot, and Stan Kasten, co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Marc is married to Bev Saltzman Lewyn, a former CNN researcher and co-author of "On the Run in Nazi Berlin." Marc and Bev live in Atlanta with their four amazing daughters.

										Favorite...
										

Marc has an odd fascination with baseball statistics and worked as a teenager for the Atlanta Braves as an usher and grounds crew, where he saw Hank Aaron’s 715th home run.  Marc also loves sailing – he almost won a major amateur sailing competition as a teenager, but alas, he learned a great life lesson instead, namely “It’s never over until it’s over.”

										Fun Fact
										

Marc occasionally coaches amateur wrestling and won a wrestling scholarship to the University of Virginia. While there, he also was the Editorial Page Editor of "The Cavalier Daily" and ended up working for a U.S. Senator from Florida. Marc is a recovering lawyer and a secret juggler.

										Favorite Quote	
										

										“If you have an important point to make, don't try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time – a tremendous whack.”  − Winston Churchill

							We’ll hold a workshop for your group							

Looking for intriguing content for your group’s upcoming get-together? Let’s talk. We’ve held interactive workshops, presentations, and panel discussions for a variety of organizations around the world. Here are a few of our most popular topics.




















									Featured Seminars
									






												For business owners / entrepreneurs												
Selling Your Business (or Not): 7 Ways to Generate Liquidity
Many business owners share a common vision: Selling their company for a hefty profit. Yet an outright sale – an “auction” – is just one way to unlock wealth, and it’s often not the best one: in a recent study, 75% of business owners who sold regretted their decision a year later, and just 5% were happy with their net proceeds.
Fortunately, there are at least six other ways to generate liquidity – and potentially become financially independent -- that may provide a more satisfying outcome and help mitigate potential regret.
This workshop is presented by Marc Lewyn, CEO of Strategic Liquidity Services at JOYN.

 

												Topics Discussed
												

												Pros & cons of selling; Alternatives to unlock wealth; Generating liquidity without losing control
												

												Intended Audiences
												

												Business owners considering an exit; Business owners seeking ways to unlock wealth
												





												Mind Over Money												
The Science of Decision-Making Under Stress (And Techniques to Try Now)
Did you know your brain’s natural biology can hijack important financial, life, and business decisions? For example…
1. Your body generates stress hormones even if you’re accustomed to high-pressure situations every day
2. Those hormones affect your brain and how it functions
3. As a result, your decision-making process can change (without you even realizing it) and lead to decisions you normally wouldn’t make. (Ouch!)
In this interactive workshop, we share cutting-edge science and potential techniques that you can apply immediately in your business and personal life.
Presented by Suzanne Durbin, ChFC®, VP & Senior Financial Advisor.

 

												Topics Discussed
												

												Your brain & its biological wiring; How perceived stress affects your brain’s natural abilities; Methods that can help you make more effective decisions
												

												Intended Audiences
												

												Anyone wanting to make effective financial and life decisions; Individuals/families facing career, business or personal decisions; Those who are curious about this fascinating science
												





												Who Told You THAT?												
Childhood Money Messages & Their Role In Your Financial Life
Remember your first piggy bank? Your first allowance? What your parents said and did to shape your views about money? Guess what: those “money messages” may still be lurking in your subconscious today, affecting your financial conversations, attitudes, behaviors, decisions, even conflicts with loved ones.
This engaging 90-minute workshop is designed to uncover the messages you’ve learned so you can approach future financial decisions with clarity and confidence. It’s packed with thought-provoking video clips (Father of the Bride, anyone?), amusing trips down memory lane, and conversations about how your own money messages serve you today. We believe you’ll walk away with:
• Fresh insights on your views about money, spending values and wealth habits (and those of your spouse or family – bring them along!)
• Greater awareness about the messages you send to important people in your life
• Deeper understanding of your past financial decisions and how you could approach future ones with more clarity and confidence
Presented by Sherwin Nelson Clemons, CFP, VP & Senior Financial Advisor.

 

												Topics Discussed
												

												Money messages you’ve learned; impact on your decisions; messages to keep/toss/reframe; future conversations and financial decisions
												

												Intended Audiences
												

												Individuals/families who are facing a major financial decision, want to de-stress financial conversations, or upgrade their relationship with money
												





												Market Update												
Current Events & Your Portfolio
The divergence of monetary policies. Will rates rise or fall (and when)? European economic weakness, low oil prices, and the strong U.S. dollar. All these factors and more could affect investment performance in the coming year.
Is your portfolio ready? Find out! Our goal is to help you balance current events and investing strategies so you can feel confident in your portfolio design for the long term.
This casual, interactive conversation works well over lunch with question-filled audiences. It’s presented by Aradhana Kejriwal, CFA, Director of Investments, and/or Deepa Lahoti, VP, Business Development.

 

												Topics Discussed
												

												Facts and insights on the state of markets; How prospective events may influence globally diversified portfolios
												

												Intended Audiences
												

												Business/professional groups; Savvy investors

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

GV Financial Advisors – Introducing a New Era: Behavioral Wealth Management





GV Financial Advisors Review (Overview)





GV Financial Advisors is an independent Registered Investment Advisor that was founded by David and Matthew Geller in 1991 as a result of the founders’ belief that conventional investment advisory firms largely ignore the human factor – how the brain and emotions affect client financial behavior and decision-making.


In 2005, GV Financial Advisors began developing the founding principles of Behavioral Wealth Management, a unique advisory model that incorporates wealth management, stress and decisions, life events expertise, and its “passion for the human factor,” which accounts for human emotions as part of the wealth management process.





Image source: GV Financial 


GV Financial Advisors is a strong believer in guiding clients on their journey to financial success through a unique perspective on how clients’ wealth can help them navigate critical life decisions – a perspective that goes far beyond the traditional “number crunching” that most other advisory firms subscribe to.


Since Behavioral Wealth Management extends far beyond your everyday traditional wealth management, GV Financial Advisors aims to create a completely different perspective for their clients.


They state, “We’re here to do more than simply help you build your wealth. Our deeper mission is to help you USE your wealth to create the life you desire.”


	 


A crucial element of the GV Financial Advisors’ philosophy is the belief that advisors should work closely with their clients to guide them through crucial, life-changing personal and professional decisions, which may be brought about as a result of life events that can have significant impacts on clients’ wealth, as well as their quality of life.





Image source: GV Financial


GV Financial Advisors is staffed by a team of loyal, long-standing employees that assure clients of continuity of service, with the average tenure of a GV employee (as of Feb. 2015) being nearly 10.5 years. GV Financial Advisors also has a unique team structure. With other financial advisors or wealth managers, a client is often assigned to only one advisor. At GV, you get a whole team. The firm’s entire culture is built around teams.












Accolades and Recognition


GV Financial Advisors has won numerous awards and accolades from its peers and industry watchers, including:



Being listed in REP's Top 100 U.S. Registered Investment Advisors in 2014 (advisory firms are ranked by total assets)


Listed for the fourth time among the top national registered investment advisors by Financial Advisor magazine


Named in the 2014 Financial Times’ "FT 300 Top Registered Investment Advisers" list


CEO David Geller’s recognition by Barron’s magazine as one of America's top financial advisors and among the top 30 in Georgia


…and many others!



Catering to high-net-worth individuals and privately-owned businesses and their families, a 2014 industry ranking placed GV Financial Advisors as the 98th largest independent registered investment advisor in the United States, with over $1.3 billion in assets under management as of January 30, 2015.
