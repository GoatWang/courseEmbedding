1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

DXUS - WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Hedged Dividend Fund






























































                            Fifty percent of the world’s investment opportunities are outside the United States1—and these companies are far from being foreign. They often represent the technologies we use, the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the coffee we drink—and much more. And the bulk of these companies pay dividends too! Of course, international investments layer currency risk on top of equity risk. 
							
							The WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Hedged Dividend Fund (DXUS) can help investors capitalize on the potential of a broad array of international dividend payers while mitigating the currency risk.

                                        This Fund is new and has limited operating history. Hedging can help returns when a foreign currency depreciates against the U.S. dollar, but it can hurt when the foreign currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.
                                        
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of companies in a single country or region, it is likely to be impacted by the events or conditions affecting that country or region. Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time. The Fund uses various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency against the U.S. dollar, which may not be successful. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
                                        
                                        WisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, in the U.S. only.

WHAT IS CURRENCY HEDGING?


International investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors. But these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations. While currency can sometimes push equity returns higher, it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty.
 

Currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange (FX) risk on international investments returns. Popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts, spot contracts, and foreign currency options.
 
At WisdomTree, we have been implementing currency-hedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more cost-effective1 than many investors expect. The bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets.


MECHANICS OF THE CURRENCY HEDGE


Here is how currency hedging typically works at WisdomTree:





 
The WisdomTree Currency Hedged Equity family of Funds implements WisdomTree’s currency-hedging strategies by entering into one-month forward contracts each month and rebalancing at month-end.

WHY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES?
 
Investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency. This risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth. This “currency bet,” as some might call it, can help increase total returns during periods when the euro, yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar.

But it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value. We believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency.



When it comes to hedging foreign currencies, there are several myths out there. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.
 
MYTH #1


It is expensive to hedge foreign currencies.


Typically, it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher short-term interest rates than the United States, as is the case in Brazil, for example. However, the euro, yen and British pound—which combine to represent almost three-quarters of the weight of the MSCI EAFE Index (a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of 21 developed countries in Europe, Australasia and Japan) —each has a very low cost to hedge, as figure 1 shows. In addition, as U.S. rates rise relative to rates in Europe and Japan, dollar-based investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure. Put another way, it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure.

MYTH #2


Euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining U.S. dollar.


The values of the euro and yen, in essence, do not make good hedges against U.S. inflation rates or declining U.S. dollar purchasing power. What does make a potentially good hedge against inflation? We believe that stocks representing claims on real assets and/or those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation. As figure 2 shows, dividend growth on the S&P 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—CPI in periods of high inflation, while currency returns did not.
 

 
MYTH #3


Currency returns are a wash in the long run.


One of the arguments we hear often is that, due to a concept called purchasing power parity (PPP), currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash. Yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends. Interestingly, international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends (as shown in figures 3A and 3B). And when the currency is down, that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure.

STRATEGIC & TACTICAL HEDGING
 
The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged. And some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency.



Additionally, currency exposure can offer an added risk with little (or no) positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk.” Although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing, it doesn’t have to be.

 
For investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally, those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen, currency hedging is an important option, as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness.
STRATEGIC HEDGING FOR THE LONG TERM
When investing for the long term, it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question. In fact, as figure 4 shows, over the short and long term, currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments. And over the long term shown below, hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the S&P 500.


TACTICAL HEDGING FOR SHORT-TERM ALLOCATIONS
Currency can make a big difference—even in the short term. In the Abenomics period starting November 30, 2012 and ending September 30, 2016, the MSCI Japan Index returned 44.4%—a decent return until it is compared to the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index, which achieved a 61.7% return over the same timeframe! The difference? The WisdomTree Index hedges the yen, which lost 18.6% over the same period, while the MSCI index does not.



 
And there were similar results throughout Europe, where the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index returned 16.1%, while the MSCI EMU Index lost 9.7% and the euro lost 18.2%.





 
WHY HEDGE DYNAMICALLY?
 
Historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short- and long-term holding periods. While currency hedging has obvious advantages, some investors may not want the challenge of timing U.S. dollar strength or weakness. Building on our expertise in currency hedging, WisdomTree pioneered dynamic currency hedging, an adaptive strategy suited for long-term investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings.
 
Problem Solving
 

Many leave it to their active manager to make the hedge/no hedge decision, but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection, not currencies
Dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to "time" when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core, long-run allocation 
Dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions

 
How Is It Achieved?
 

WisdomTree partnered with Record Currency Management, a currency manager with over 30 years of experience, to determine hedging signals for the new Index family1
Targeting Profitable Hedges: The strategy targets mid to long-term excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses
Diversification by Signal Time Horizon: Signals used to determine hedges (interest rates , value, momentum) have diversification in time horizon efficacy

EUROPE & INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS

 
International investments should have a place in every portfolio, and now may be an opportune time to add them.
 

Of course, we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the U.S. dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats, we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar. And if the dollar is rising, other currencies are often weakening. Hedging them can help to reduce volatility.



EUROPE HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 
The European Central Bank’s recent monetary easing policies have helped our Europe Hedged Equity family perform well. Not only are many of the world's leading companies—and familiar brands—headquartered in Europe, but these are truly global companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from exporting to countries outside Europe. Our family of European Hedged Equity Funds offers investors a way to more fully access the return potential of European equities while hedging the effects of the currencies.

JAPAN & KOREA CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS
 
Asian investments can be a smart addition to a portfolio. And now may be an opportune time to add Japan and Korea, as these countries are both undergoing exciting changes.
 

However, history has shown that in export-driven economies, the equities typically go up when the currency is going down. And this can erode investors’ returns. Hedging the yen and the won can help reduce volatility.



JAPAN HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results.

DXUS - WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Hedged Dividend Fund






























































                            Fifty percent of the world’s investment opportunities are outside the United States1—and these companies are far from being foreign. They often represent the technologies we use, the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the coffee we drink—and much more. And the bulk of these companies pay dividends too! Of course, international investments layer currency risk on top of equity risk. 
							
							The WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Hedged Dividend Fund (DXUS) can help investors capitalize on the potential of a broad array of international dividend payers while mitigating the currency risk.

                                        This Fund is new and has limited operating history. Hedging can help returns when a foreign currency depreciates against the U.S. dollar, but it can hurt when the foreign currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.
                                        
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of companies in a single country or region, it is likely to be impacted by the events or conditions affecting that country or region. Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time. The Fund uses various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency against the U.S. dollar, which may not be successful. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
                                        
                                        WisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, in the U.S. only.

WHAT IS CURRENCY HEDGING?


International investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors. But these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations. While currency can sometimes push equity returns higher, it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty.
 

Currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange (FX) risk on international investments returns. Popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts, spot contracts, and foreign currency options.
 
At WisdomTree, we have been implementing currency-hedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more cost-effective1 than many investors expect. The bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets.


MECHANICS OF THE CURRENCY HEDGE


Here is how currency hedging typically works at WisdomTree:





 
The WisdomTree Currency Hedged Equity family of Funds implements WisdomTree’s currency-hedging strategies by entering into one-month forward contracts each month and rebalancing at month-end.

WHY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES?
 
Investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency. This risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth. This “currency bet,” as some might call it, can help increase total returns during periods when the euro, yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar.

But it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value. We believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency.



When it comes to hedging foreign currencies, there are several myths out there. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.
 
MYTH #1


It is expensive to hedge foreign currencies.


Typically, it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher short-term interest rates than the United States, as is the case in Brazil, for example. However, the euro, yen and British pound—which combine to represent almost three-quarters of the weight of the MSCI EAFE Index (a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of 21 developed countries in Europe, Australasia and Japan) —each has a very low cost to hedge, as figure 1 shows. In addition, as U.S. rates rise relative to rates in Europe and Japan, dollar-based investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure. Put another way, it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure.

MYTH #2


Euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining U.S. dollar.


The values of the euro and yen, in essence, do not make good hedges against U.S. inflation rates or declining U.S. dollar purchasing power. What does make a potentially good hedge against inflation? We believe that stocks representing claims on real assets and/or those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation. As figure 2 shows, dividend growth on the S&P 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—CPI in periods of high inflation, while currency returns did not.
 

 
MYTH #3


Currency returns are a wash in the long run.


One of the arguments we hear often is that, due to a concept called purchasing power parity (PPP), currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash. Yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends. Interestingly, international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends (as shown in figures 3A and 3B). And when the currency is down, that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure.

STRATEGIC & TACTICAL HEDGING
 
The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged. And some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency.



Additionally, currency exposure can offer an added risk with little (or no) positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk.” Although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing, it doesn’t have to be.

 
For investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally, those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen, currency hedging is an important option, as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness.
STRATEGIC HEDGING FOR THE LONG TERM
When investing for the long term, it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question. In fact, as figure 4 shows, over the short and long term, currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments. And over the long term shown below, hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the S&P 500.


TACTICAL HEDGING FOR SHORT-TERM ALLOCATIONS
Currency can make a big difference—even in the short term. In the Abenomics period starting November 30, 2012 and ending September 30, 2016, the MSCI Japan Index returned 44.4%—a decent return until it is compared to the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index, which achieved a 61.7% return over the same timeframe! The difference? The WisdomTree Index hedges the yen, which lost 18.6% over the same period, while the MSCI index does not.



 
And there were similar results throughout Europe, where the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index returned 16.1%, while the MSCI EMU Index lost 9.7% and the euro lost 18.2%.





 
WHY HEDGE DYNAMICALLY?
 
Historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short- and long-term holding periods. While currency hedging has obvious advantages, some investors may not want the challenge of timing U.S. dollar strength or weakness. Building on our expertise in currency hedging, WisdomTree pioneered dynamic currency hedging, an adaptive strategy suited for long-term investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings.
 
Problem Solving
 

Many leave it to their active manager to make the hedge/no hedge decision, but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection, not currencies
Dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to "time" when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core, long-run allocation 
Dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions

 
How Is It Achieved?
 

WisdomTree partnered with Record Currency Management, a currency manager with over 30 years of experience, to determine hedging signals for the new Index family1
Targeting Profitable Hedges: The strategy targets mid to long-term excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses
Diversification by Signal Time Horizon: Signals used to determine hedges (interest rates , value, momentum) have diversification in time horizon efficacy

EUROPE & INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS

 
International investments should have a place in every portfolio, and now may be an opportune time to add them.
 

Of course, we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the U.S. dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats, we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar. And if the dollar is rising, other currencies are often weakening. Hedging them can help to reduce volatility.



EUROPE HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 
The European Central Bank’s recent monetary easing policies have helped our Europe Hedged Equity family perform well. Not only are many of the world's leading companies—and familiar brands—headquartered in Europe, but these are truly global companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from exporting to countries outside Europe. Our family of European Hedged Equity Funds offers investors a way to more fully access the return potential of European equities while hedging the effects of the currencies.

JAPAN & KOREA CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS
 
Asian investments can be a smart addition to a portfolio. And now may be an opportune time to add Japan and Korea, as these countries are both undergoing exciting changes.
 

However, history has shown that in export-driven economies, the equities typically go up when the currency is going down. And this can erode investors’ returns. Hedging the yen and the won can help reduce volatility.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
