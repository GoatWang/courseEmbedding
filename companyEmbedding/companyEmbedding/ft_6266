The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

The time is right to begin "living the lake life" on beautiful Lake Gage one of Indiana's top all sports lakes. You will be impressed with the colorful hues of blue and green as the sun glistens across the waters not to mention the firm non mucky bottom on your beach. The home has been well cared for and features a three car garage plus a workshop/garage, walk in closets, waterfront decks, four bedrooms with a huge master, three full baths, irrigation system, additional back lot, and professional landscaping. The view is tremendous during the day and beyond tremendous as the sun sets in the evening. Almost all items in the garage, home, and in the lake are for sale outside of the purchase agreement. Lets view this property soon.

                    We are so lucky to have Pokagon State Park here in Angola, Indiana at the edge of Fremont, Indiana. The park is amazing with beautiful hiking trails, horses, the ever famous toboggan slides, beaches, camping.  There is also a beautiful Inn and various cabins to rent.  The park was originally called Lake James State Park, but they changed the name in 1925 to Pokagon State Park to honor the rich native American heritage of the state and the region.  From the Indiana State website it adds, "Leopold and Simon Pokagon were father and son and the last two most notable leaders of the Potawatomi. The park's Potawatomi Inn takes its name from these Native Americans, who made their home in the area. The inn, with its up-north fishing-lodge theme, is one of the Midwest's most popular resorts and conference centers." 

Come and enjoy the natural beauty. I promise you will be absolutely delighted with all it has to offer.
