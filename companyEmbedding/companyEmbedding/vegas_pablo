The Solis Story
SOLIS is an innovatively simple and elegant suspension lamp that can be used as a pendant, hung from a wall, or as a freestanding portable luminaire to create a distinctive ambiance. SOLIS is engaging blend of light and shadows filtering light through its laser-cut streams and radiating patterns resembling the sun's rays. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,Award Copy!Award Copy!

ABOUT PABCO® GYPSUM 



 






Home
About Us





 
About Us
PABCO Gypsum, a division of PABCO Building Products, has provided quality gypsum board products and service for over 35 years, and is a part of Pacific Coast Building Products, one of the nation’s leading, privately held suppliers of building products and services to the construction industry. The company employs individuals in 11 states in the western U.S. and Canada and has over 75 locations.
PABCO Gypsum began manufacturing and shipping  gypsum board from its Newark, California facility in 1972. 
Five years later, PABCO expanded with the acquisition of a board plant and gypsum quarry north of Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1998 and again in 2005, the Las Vegas plant was expanded and modernized.  In 2009 the Newark, California plant was also expanded and modernized.  Today the two facilities supply over 1.65 billion annual square feet of gypsum board. Our complete line of gypsum products is used in virtually all types of construction ─ from residential to high-rise structures.
PABCO also owns and operates PABCO Paper, a customized gypsum face and back paper mill utilizing 100% recycled paper in Vernon, California. The mill was acquired in 1984, and after undergoing a complete modernization, can produce 3.3 billion square feet annually, which is enough to supply all of PABCO’s needs.  For quality assurance Underwriters Laboratories Inc. provides the required third party inspection service for all of PABCO’s fire-rated products and their UL Classified label is stamped on the back of each panel.
Our PABCO Gypsum sales staff, supported by technical services, stands as a team ready to help you in the selection of PABCO gypsum board products and systems for your next project, and to help you find a dealer in your area.

Yesterday I went to Green Valley Gas Station off of Decatur and Horse, and I put money into a machine, and play dollars, it dealt me 3 Aces on the first hand but for some reason it didn't hold one of them, Then dealt me the ace needed for 4 aces and a kicker, meaning, I was suppose to get 4 aces with a kicker,the middle button has been not working properly  on this machine for a while, sometimes it holds, sometimes it doesn't, but because It usually only caused me to loose a pair, I would normally just let it go as if it happened it would be just a dollar or so lost, well because this was a several hundred dollar mistake due to malefaction on the machine, as you can imagine I was upset, so I tell the cashier, they call their gambling dept that runs all their Green Valley Stations Gambling machines, I'll keep all the details short, so what end up happening is they came down, rolled the machines and saw that I was right, had the 3 ace hold it would have given me the fourth ace with kicker, and took full responsibility, owned up, and paid me my money. Going through this experience, I now know their on top of their game, and have complete faith in their business ethics, and  will continue to gamble there daily, as this place runs there stores with good business ethics, and above all are honest and fair, you can gamble knowing they aren't cheating customers, or fixing machines to their benefit.  Besides being honest with their machines, The manager who works here is also the best manager I have ever seen work at a gas station, she runs this place just a business owner would, and I would know because my husband and I own business' here in Vegas.  The whole staff is friendly, and professional. Long story short, I would advise anyone who likes to gamble like me, to skip the casinos, and other gas stations  and gamble here at Green Valley Gas Stations, besides them being honest, the machines pay out decent and often, so there not tight like the casinos or other gas stations and their HONEST, they don't cheat you out of your money.New India MarketBrian K. ratedThis is such a great store I am so happy I went there.  When I first arrived in Vegas I had gone to the bigger Indian store nearby and they had far fewer items, and associates who were unwilling to help.This store may be smaller but it is packed with anything and everything you need for indian cuisine, north or south.  And the man who runs the store is always there and is extremely meticulous in his job duties and customer service.  He is perhaps the most helpful store associate I have met in Vegas.  He took so much time and care to make sure I found everything that I needed and that all questions were answered.I am really only familiar with Tamilnadu and Sri Lanken cooking so I had a lot of questions for him and he answered every one very thoroughly and was such a kind man he really made my day (which hadn't been going very well up until then).  He talked to me about ingredients and recipe ideas and nutritional facts of the ingredients.Smith'sCleo B. ratedWas at your Smiths grocery store on Decatur and Desert Inn on Friday August 12th,Las Vegas NV ,was going down an aisle and slipped on something wet on the floor , manager was called and she took pic of knee and got my name and number , my complaint is ,a courtesy call would have been nice to see if i was okay,here it is Monday August 15th ,called the store to get their main customer service number and the girl at customer service gave me a fake number,so i found the number myself and  i called the customer service number and told them about the fake number i was given and that i should have gotten a courtesy call from the manager and not even a half hour after hanging up with them , i got a call from some guy who would only give me his first name , but it took me calling them to get a call,i feel a customer deserves better service then what i got.India MarketGeeta S. ratedI bought 4 large packs of mopleez brand of namkeenthree weeks ago and all four smelled bad. On my next trip to the store I said this to hopals mother and she just ignored it saying oh really. This week I looked at the price of cauliflower and it was 4.99 each for a very small cauliflower.this is a bugrip off as stores like winco are selling large cauliflowers for 1.98 per piece.this family run store is fleecing the customers and even after staying in the U.S for so many years they do not understand the meaning of customer serviceGreen Valley Groceryluvnwhatudoing ratedi love comen to this store it ...i love comen to this store it feels like home the managers aare the best the cashiers are something special I go in between the hrs of 3 to maybe 2 in the morning and I must say this is the best this store has ever been I love when benson is there and  sherie is there they are the most helpfull workers ever.  I admire the way they keep the store clean they  make you want to come in and shop just for there company. Green Valley you are doing a great job and i'm sure glad that you have have a wonderful staff now.AlbertsonsJill R. ratedThis was the closest grocery store to the soccer field we were near. We were there to buy some fruit and popcorn for snacks. The apples were a decent price, but not totally firm the way we like. The cashier service was somewhat quick. I like how we got the discounted prices without needing a savings card.Smith'samanda.gober3 ratedGod Bless The Managermy name is Amanda I am a single mother of two. I have hit bottom and didn't have enough money to buy my newborn formula. I went to SMITHS with 5$ and asked if there was anything they could do and the manager gave me 20$ out of his pocket. I will never forget him. thank you god bless you merry ChristmasWinCo FoodsB G. ratedOverall GREAT grocery store, with friendly stuff, amazing selection, and even more amazing prices. Only knock for this place is that it "feels cheap." It's always crowded, because of the rest deals, so loads of people come in, and there are pocket areas of mess. Smith's Food & DrugJosh S. ratedThis Smith's is always very busy and fast paced but they seem to keep it under wraps. They keep the store really clean for being so busy as well. Professional and friendly are 2 words I can think of to describe the associates at this store. Thanks, Josh SimiGreen Valley Grocerykimreneejay ratedThis manager that operates this facility goes above and beyond what I anticipated.  He treats the shop as if it were his own.  Very professional and exceptional customer service.  I will go out of my way to frequent this particular store in the future.

Los Cucos can't compete with Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan, but it still has pretty good eats and great service.The interior is strange, a rag-tag looking atmosphere in what is (obviously) a space formerly inhabited by MiMi's Cafe. The Mardi Gras balcony is still there, but now there's some sparse, randomly placed Mexican decor lining the walls. The restaurant feels spacious, open and clean, and there's a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door. The place lacks character, but it's a pleasant enough atmosphere.I had to laugh at the menu because it's loaded with misspellings ("crispi" tacos, "romain" lettuce) and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items (check out the special fajitas on the menu). When I pointed this out to our server, she couldn't explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description. I eventually got what I wanted, but the menu had the dish listed under two different names. You'd think for a chain restaurant, the menu would be consistent (and free of spelling errors).As with most Mexican eateries, the house serves complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good enough but served cold; the salsas are DELICIOUS. Like seriously delicious. There's a spicy, smoky red salsa that's served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa. Both of these were the highlight of my meal and I am still craving them (they'll make me return to the restaurant often).We ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer. At $11.95, it's overpriced. The cheese wasn't that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions, mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff. The shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious; however, I wouldn't order this again.For lunch I ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas. The meat quality was top-notch. I LOVED the marinade on both of the meats, and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town. The fajita vegetables were just okay -- onions and poblano peppers. I was disappointed in the overall fajitas, but I'd love to have just the meat served on its own. I had fajitas that came "loaded" with bacon and cheese, and it was an unusual and very tasty combo. The side plate was huge and had so/so beans, average rice, and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallo.Fatty alert: they serve homemade flour tortillas, and they are delicious! I love Mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas, and I'm happy that Los Cucos does it right. I could've eaten two dozen of them! It's a bummer that they aren't served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels. This means the tortillas get hard very quickly. Best to gobble them up as soon as possible!After our lunch, Jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything. He was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions. I was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient, friendly service we received.This isn't the best Mexican food in Vegas, but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients, the prices on most menu items are fair, and the service is good.Lindo Michoacan-West FlamingoLouisa M. ratedOne of the three Lindo Michoacan locations in Las Vegas, this one can definitely hold its own. While not quite as good as its sister locations, this is the closest one to me so I eat here often. The signature stellar Lindo service is here (really, how do they always manage to give 5 star service no matter the time of day) and the food is delicious.I love the queso here, it's basically a big plate of REAL melty cheese baked with charred poblano peppers and served with Lindo's delicious homemade flour tortillas! I love the tortillas here and I frequently eat my weight in them (bye bye low carb diet). The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip is always a hit too. The food here is just delicious. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes (although sometimes the chicken quality in some of the specialty dishes is a little bit rubbery and "off" -- don't know why, but it has happened a couple of times at this location). I've never had an issue with the chicken quality in the chicken fajitas or with any of the seafood or beef dishes. The guacamole is worth getting, and they have yummy Diet Pepsi and fresh brewed iced tea. Again, the focus is on quality and service.The prices are higher than your average Mexican restaurant but I think it's worth it. This location runs incredible lunch deals and specials during the week, and the kitchen is fast so it's the perfect spot for a quick workday lunch.The hostesses will automatically try to seat you in the bar section of the restaurant if you are a party of just adults. There's an extra special atmosphere in this area on weeknights when a dude in a sparkly red shirt plays a synthesizer and sings pop songs in broken English. It's pretty rad and it's not too loud, which is nice. If you are looking for a quieter experience, ask to be seated in the other part of the restaurant.Note that the parking lot here is deceptive and is often overflowing with cars. Even if it appears packed, do not be discouraged and assume there's a wait -- go in anyway. I've never had to wait here even on a very busy Saturday night.Casa Don Juan Restaurantval.sutter.165 ratedWe were seated quickly with our drinks and chips delivered within minutes after we ordered them.  All servers were polite and attentive.   The food was borderline good to excellent, portions were large, I had the #4 combination, (ChickenTamale with green chile verde, beef enchilada. Beef taco with Mexican rice and beans, it could have used a little more sauce.   My husband had a #24, a chicken & beef Fajita, with rice & beans,  the portion was very large with a lot of beef and chicken , both tender and tasty .   We would recommend this resturant to everyone.Original Lindo Michoacanjhgf454 ratedWe drove by this place a couple times and were deterred by the long lines. Finally, kids were up early and we decided to head out and try it. Food was pretty good, in a basic breakfast kinda way. Nothing fancy or special about the food. Scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs, pancakes plain ol' flapjacks. The atmosphere was busy and there seemed to be mainly tourists there. So this is not surprising. Great location close to beach, but we wouldn't make another special trip out there just to eat the food.Original Lindo Michoacanbacchuss140 ratedThe food here has a distinct lean toward the interior of Mexico. The flavors are smokey and very complex. If you are expecting cheese enchiladas and tacos, you'll be disappointed, but if you're willing to try fish tacos, caldo de pollo in a rich red chili broth or chunky guacamole served in a molcajete, then this is your place. The service is attentive without being obtrusive. I didn't get the prix fixe lunch, but it did look like a tremendous value.Original Lindo Michoacanlauraa33 ratedStill one of the best in Vegas, after all these years. This location is so much better than the others for some reason. The nopalitos are just great and a hard to find item here. We always take visitors there even though we live across town. My spouse and I went for dinner tonight and had a very fun experience at Lindo Michoacan. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the service-all very much. We're defintely planning to go back soon!El Burrito Mexican Restauranthotspotguy ratedWow found this gem in Las VegasI went in last week and was sat down in this cute spot with lights above me.Immediately was greeted and ordered a guacamole and Margarita. The margarita was so good and strong. Surprised . I am a margarita expert. The guacamole was def hand made I could taste the lime and flavor in each bite.Owner was nice but quiet said he had been in business for 28 years. Why is this not a franchise I don't know! Will be back every Sunday!Original Lindo Michoacanmtim363 ratedI've eaten here a few times before, and they do have some of the best Mexican food in town. As I'm a big fan of Day of the Dead folk art, I enjoyed much of the interior decor. They had very good Mexican food, at reasonable prices. Table side guacamole is a must have every time. Ceviche is excellent, carnitas: excellent. Combination plates are all good. Wash it down with a premium margarita. Great service, very attentive.Hussong's Cantinadjbabes1 ratedWe stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and the place was very quiet.  Our server and the kitchen were pretty slow and the food was definitely overpriced.  We tried the Guacamole, Corn on the cobb, Vegan Enchiladas, and Soy Chicken Tacos.  The Guacamole was very small and flavorless.  The corn was disgusting; it was bland and overcooked/burnt.  The free chips and salsa were the best things there.  The entrees were just "ok".Roberto's Taco Shoplee.mccann.739 ratedThe food is good, but the serv...The food is good, but the service stinks.  First you can buy extra hot sauce in a tub, next time they can give you some, but not sell it...next time, they don't give any in a tub nor do they sell any in a tub; next time you are only allowed 2 tiny individual containers each....not to mention the service gal taking the orders absolutely never smiles, very unfriendly...it's a shame, 'cause the food is really good.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
