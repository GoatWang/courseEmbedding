PEOPLE FIRST.
RIDES IN SECONDS
Fasten does more than find you a ride in no time, we do it in a way that is fair for everyone.

APPS DON’T DRIVE YOU.
PEOPLE DO
Taking less than $1 per ride instead of 20-28% puts more of your fare in the pockets of the people who deserve it the most: drivers. And you still pay the industry-lowest rates!

See your fare in real-time.
It’s that simple. You hop in. Your
                            ride
                            starts. Then right there in the app you can track the fare as you go.


Leave a tip if you wish.
Cash-free in-app tipping makes it easy for you to give a little extra, completely anonymously. Opt in or out any time.


About “Boost”
We always show price estimates in advance and we don’t take a percentage from higher rates during peak times. We charge drivers only $0.99/ride so our rates are always lower for riders while drivers still make more.

About “Boost”
The problem with taking a percentage is that a higher rate during peak time means more for ‘them’. Not with Boost. We still take $0.99.

Screw Categories
Using the right kind of screw is essential to any construction project, large or small, whether you are a contractor doing a renovation or a builder erecting an entire residential subdivision or office complex. You need screws specifically manufactured for the material to be fastened — whether it’s concrete, wood, metal or something else — and that will hold up for their designated use. At Fastener SuperStore we provide a wide range of options for customers looking to buy wholesale screws of virtually any type. Below is a list of screw categories and some common uses, along with information about what Fastener SuperStore can do for you.

Screws and Their Uses

Fastener SuperStore, Inc., is your best bet when you have to buy bulk screws for practically any application. Here are some of the most common uses for various types of screws that we carry:

Concrete screws are incredibly tough and made specifically for firm placement in concrete and masonry. They are excellent for use in heavy-duty construction when something has to be anchored to a cement wall or foundation.
Deck screws are common fasteners used for a wide range of applications, notably decks and outdoor woodwork. They are well suited for use in pressure-treated lumber.
Drywall screws are specially made to hold securely in drywall or other typically weak surfaces. They also can be used in wood studs.
Lag screws also are used for wood and are especially useful in heavy lumber that will bear a heavy load.
Machine screws are used with size matched nuts for attaching metal parts and materials.
Metric screws are sized differently than US standard screws and come in several different styles.
Self-drilling screws are ideal for applications in which you need to fasten materials without pre-drilling a hole.
Self-piercing screws, like self-drilling screws, do not require pre-drilling. They are commonly used in roofing.
Self-tapping screws are also commonly called sheet metal screws, and are used for a wide variety of applications. Pre-drilling may or may not be required, depending upon the material you are installing these into.
SEMS screws are preassembled with a free-spinning lock washer. These screws are perfect for applications that require a washer, saving on installation time.
Serrated hex flange screws are used in applications that require firm locking of the screw itself.
Thread-cutting screws have a sharp cutting tip that creates threads in wood, plastics and metals not already threaded.
Thread-forming screws, which come in different styles, also form their own threads and are best used in thinner materials.
Thumb screws are made to be easily secured by hand.
Weld screws are used when a screw must be permanently welded to a metal surface.
Wing screws are similarly made for easy turning by hand, making them useful in assembly and machinery.
Wood screws are ideal for wood applications.

Slotted flat head cap screws are designed with countersunk heads, making them good for applications that require perfectly flush surfaces.
Square head machine bolts are used for the same applications as standard hex bolts but are increasingly common for use in both machinery and wood.
Step bolts are common in wooden decks because they are smooth and nearly flush.

Countless Applications for Quality Washers

Our washers are highly versatile. Here are a few common applications:

Beveled washers are commonly used in applications involving an I-beam, as they can be easily attached through the flanges.
Countersunk finishing washers are ideal for applications where smoothness and appearance are important factors. They can be used with flat and oval head screws for wood and metal applications.
Dock washers are thick washers that can are often used in the building or repair of docks.
External tooth lockwashers have teeth that extend outward so that they can easily bite into the bearing surface. This is a very useful feature for applications in which the bolt should never loosen.
Fender washers are thin flat washers that are commonly used to provide a wide bearing surface.
Flat washers refer to a group of washers that are flat and smooth, capable of dispersing load in a variety of applications.
Internal tooth lockwashers are commonly used to firmly secure the screw and nut connection and prevent it from loosening over time.
Internal/external combo tooth lockwashers combine the benefits of both types of lockwasher and add a great deal of protection against loosening.
Metric washers are flat washers for use with hardware with metric-style threading.
Shoulder washers include an extended sleeve on the internal surface. This can be inserted into the adjacent material, which helps to insulate metal screws in electrical applications. This also reduces friction between parts.
Split lockwashers are made with a divide that serves a similar purpose as an internal tooth lockwasher, preventing loosening and slipping.
Structural washers are made from high-grade steel and are heat treated, making them perfect for use with structural bolts and nuts.
Thru Hard washers are heat treated and made for heavy-duty use. These washers have exceptionally high tightness tolerance.
