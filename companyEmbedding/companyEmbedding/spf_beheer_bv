What are analysts saying about Flowserve Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Flowserve Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Flowserve’s key strengths include leading position in the flow control industry, strong aftermarket business comprehensive product portfolio and wide global footprint. Also, the company’s strong aftermarket business is expected to act as a major growth catalyst. Moreover, the diligent restructuring plans are resulting in substantial cost savings, thus adding to Flowserve’s strength. In addition, increased project bidding activities in the energy markets signal brighter days, going forward. However, on the flip side, pricing pressure has proved to be a major drag on the company’s top-line performance over the past few quarters. Also, loss of sales leverage and related under-absorption are pressurizing the financials. The company’s shares have witnessed a negative return, comparing unfavorably to the Zacks categorized Machinery-General industry's average gain over the past six months." (7/17/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "Weak capital spending in its end-markets seem very likely to again offset restructuring savings and push down earnings by 20% in '17 ... the third straight -20% year. '17 now becomes important only to gauge '18E and '19E. Buying the stock here requires a bit of imagination on multiples, or patience until we have visibility on '19E." (2/21/2017)
3. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "Flowserve reported 4Q16 revenue of $1.07 billion (Stifel $1.08 billion, Street $1.07 billion) and adjusted EPS of $0.72 (Stifel $0.68, Street $0.64). The beat was driven by $0.05 of lower than expected tax, slightly offset by $0.01 of below the line expense. Operationally the quarter was in line' 2017 outlook below consensus estimates seems largely due to an air pocket in 1Q17 revenue which drives under-absorption of fixed costs and these challenges in 1Q17 are responsible for the majority of the reduction in our 2017E EPS. We see green shoots which could drive upside as early as 2H17 in refinery/chemical turnarounds in 2H17, distributor restocking driving sales above real demand for a period, and IPD execution improvement driving improved performance in 2Q17+. We maintain our Buy rating on FLS shares." (2/21/2017)
4. Seaport Global Securities analysts commented, "We are upgrading shares of FLS to Buy (from Neutral) as short-cycle capex in heavy industries shows definitive signs of bottoming and optimism for growth in 2017. Furthermore, the benefits from realignment initiatives that have lagged peers are poised to inflect in 2017 and at a time when they should begin to help lever FLS's QRC footprint. While a capital spending recovery is still expected to lag MRO/maintenance activity, we remain optimistic that bookings can remain stable at these depressed levels and a mid-cycle acceleration in project activity would be incremental to our estimates. We anticipate a strong FCF recovery in 2017 to 136% of net income, up from our 2016 estimate of 45%. Based on our estimates, the company's 2017 FCF yield is 5.6% (above its historical average of 4.0%), which in our view remains attractive at this point in the cycle. Our price target is now $60 (up from $48)." (1/23/2017)
