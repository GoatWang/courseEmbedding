Mutual fund investing involves risk; Principal loss is possible. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in Asset-Backed and Mortgage-Backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increase susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Investments in foreign securities may involve political, economic and currency risks, greater volatility and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. In order to achieve its investment objectives, the Core Fixed Income Fund may use certain types of investment derivatives. Derivatives involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. The Fund may also invest in securities related to real estate, which may decline in value as a result of factors affecting the real estate industry.  The Fund may use leverage which may cause the effect of an increase or decrease in the value of the portfolio securities to be magnified and the Fund to be more volatile than if leverage was not used.

Fixed Income Asset AllocationDescriptionBenchmarkCore Plus Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return through active asset allocation across fixed income sectors. Active asset allocation is paramount in our efforts to mitigate risk and achieve better risk-adjusted returns. The strategy can be more or less aggressive per client mandate.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexFlexible IncomeSeeks long term absolute return, high current income and capital appreciation through active asset allocation across global fixed income sectors using duration management based on the manager's view of, among other things, future interest rates and market conditions. Duration can vary from 3 to 10 yearsBenchmark: Not managed to a specific benchmark. Targets Libor +250 basis pointsLong Duration Total ReturnSeeks long-term total return through active asset allocation using the traditional Liability Driven Investing (LDI) asset classes, U.S. Government and U.S. Corporate securities, but differentiates itself by adding long-term agency mortgages to that mix. The advantage to adding mortgages is to potentially add alpha with lower volatility and higher credit quality in comparison to corporate bonds, but also cut down on overall credit exposure.Benchmark: Barclays Long U.S. Government/Corporate IndexLow DurationSeeks current income with reduced volatility. Incorporates active asset allocation across fixed income sectors using short duration securities including a mix of both fixed and floating rate products while maintaining a balance between credit and interest rate risk.Benchmark: BofA/Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury IndexOpportunistic Core Plus Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return through a more aggressive active asset allocation approach across fixed income sectors while trying to mitigate risk and achieve better risk-adjusted returns. The strategy maintains a higher targeted alpha and tracking error.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexTotal Return TacticalSeeks to maximize total return across fixed income sectors while maintaining active risk management constraints. The strategy has two primary drivers of alpha: 1) Actively manages the risk exposure by changing the mix between government and credit. The credit component is diversified across fixed income sectors. 2) The strategy maintains a lower duration than the benchmark.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexSector Specific Fixed IncomeDescriptionBenchmarkEmerging Markets Fixed IncomeSeek high total return from current income and capital appreciation. The strategy is typically concentrated in U.S. dollar-denominated securities and favors corporates over sovereigns. We believe the corporate sector is a secularly improving credit story and is slightly more insulated from global unrest vs. sovereigns.Benchmark: JP Morgan Emerging Markets Global Diversified IndexFloating RateSeeks a high level of current income by investing primarily in floating rate loans and other floating rate investments while diversifying across industries and issuers. Preservation of capital stands and satisfaction of credit and valuation criteria comes before incremental yield.Benchmark: S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan IndexGlobal BondSeeks to generate strong risk-adjusted returns from the global bond markets. DoubleLine believes that combining bond and currency investments across countries creates a well diversified portfolio that can take advantage of different market, business and economic cyclesBenchmark: Citi World Government Bond Index (WGBI)Global InfrastructureInfrastructure debt has low correlation to other fixed income assets and can lower overall portfolio volatility while potentially delivering incremental yields in a fixed income portfolio. It's an asset class with growing investor demand. It's supported by strong underlying fundamentals and defensive attributes that are attractive. Projects provide essential services and can include, airports, toll roads, power plants, renewable energy, etc.  Client customization available.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexStrategic MBSStrategic MBS is a best ideas mortgages 100%. The team believes that the most reliable way to enhance returns is to exploit inefficiencies within the subsectors of the MBS market while maintaining active risk management constraints.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexTotal ReturnSeeks to maximize total return across fixed income sectors while maintaining active risk management constraints. The strategy has two primary drivers of alpha: 1) Actively managing risk exposures by changing the mix between government and credit which have potentially off-setting risks. Historically the strategy has used mortgages for both government and credit components because mortgages offer homogeneous fundamentals. 2) Duration is actively managed and maintained lower than the benchmark.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexEquitiesDescriptionBenchmarkShiller Enhanced CAPE®Seeks total return which exceeds the benchmark index. The strategy maintains a core portfolio of debt instruments that focuses on global fixed income sector rotation while simultaneously obtaining exposure to the Shiller CAPE® US Sector TR USD Index. The rules-based index aims to identify undervalued sectors based on a modified CAPE® Ratio which then uses a momentum factor to mitigate the effects of potential value traps. By using both a value indicator and a momentum indicator, the Index aims to provide more stable and improved risk adjusted returns.Benchmark: S&P 500CommoditiesDescriptionBenchmarkStrategic CommodityStrategic Commodity2 will maintain a core long-commodity biased weighting while tactically allocating to the long-short dollar-neutral commodity strategy when a long-only strategy may not be as attractive. The long commodity positions are focused on commodities that have historically exhibited the highest degree of backwardation while the long-short strategy utilizes fundamental signals to determine its allocation. The long bias will make up 50-100% of the strategy allocation while the opportunistic long/short will comprise 0-50%.Benchmark: Bloomberg Commodity IndexGlobal MacroDescriptionBenchmarkMulti-Asset GrowthSeeks long-term capital appreciation with an absolute return focus. The strategy provides a flexible global asset allocation framework that has three goals: capital appreciation, avoidance of catastrophic capital loss, and exploitation of market volatility. DoubleLine best Ideas Global Macro strategy which invests opportunistically in Commodities, Currencies, Equities and Fixed Income.Benchmark: Blended Benchmark3Alternative Investment StrategiesDescriptionBenchmarkOpportunistic CRE Debt StrategySeeks to generate stable current income while preserving capital through investments on a leveraged basis in a diversified portfolio of debt investments, or participations therein consisting primarily of first mortgage loans on commercial real estate; CMBS, including CMBS B-Pieces; subordinated commercial mortgage loans, including B-Notes; and mezzanine loans secured by equity interests in commercial real estate. The strategy intends to utilize leverage to enhance returns on its loan origination and acquisition investments. Four year investment period from final closing date.Benchmark: Barclays U.S. CMBS Index Opportunistic Income – Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return. Strategy known as Jeffrey Gundlach's "Best Ideas" fixed Income strategy. Historically the strategy has been concentrated heavily in Mortgages but invest opportunistically. The strategy employs leverage. Monthly liquidity with 45 days notice.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexOpportunistic Income – Global MacroBest Ideas Global Macro strategy is a "go anywhere, do anything" investing mainly across Equities but can invest in Fixed Income, Commodities and currencies.
