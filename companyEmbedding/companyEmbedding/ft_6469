                    Waterloo's history dates back to the 18th century, with the French being the first Europeans to settle in the area. The site was ideal because of its elevation to the proximity of the Mississippi River Valley.  This city has been growing since 2000, most popular for it's country living life style and minutes away from the JB Bridge taking you to South St. Louis area.

      Excluding special items, the $.27 per share increase in second quarter
      2017 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2016, was driven
      primarily by higher prices and mix ($.25), sales volumes ($.09), and
      production volumes ($.03) in our Packaging segment, lower annual
      maintenance outage costs ($.05), lower taxes ($.06) and a partial
      insurance recovery related to the DeRidder Mill incident ($.02). These
      items were partially offset by higher costs for energy ($.06), fiber
      ($.05), labor ($.03) and chemicals ($.01), higher freight ($.02),
      interest ($.02), depreciation ($.02) and other expenses ($.01), and
      lower Paper segment prices and mix ($.01).
    

      Results were $.07 per share above the second quarter guidance primarily
      due to higher Packaging segment sales prices and volume ($.03), a lower
      tax rate ($.03), and a partial insurance recovery related to the
      DeRidder incident ($.02), partly offset by higher recycled fiber prices
      ($.01).
    

      Financial information by segment is summarized below and in the
      schedules with this release.

      In the Packaging segment, total corrugated products shipments with one
      less workday were up 10.0% and shipments per day were up 11.7% over last
      year’s second quarter. Containerboard production was 947,000 tons, and
      containerboard inventory was down 25,000 tons compared to the second
      quarter of 2016 and 14,000 tons below the first quarter of 2017. In the
      Paper segment, price and mix as well as sales volumes were lower than
      the second quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.
    

      Commenting on the quarter, Mark W. Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO, said, “Our
      results were driven by continued strong demand as well as from the
      benefits of our recent TimBar and Columbus Container acquisitions. The
      containerboard and corrugated products price increases were implemented
      as planned, which helped us offset higher inflation in many of our
      manufacturing and converting costs and higher freight costs. Our
      containerboard inventory levels were below those of a year ago and
      year-end levels despite the additional containerboard inventory
      requirements of our acquisitions.”
    

      “Looking ahead to the third quarter,” Mr. Kowlzan added, “we expect to
      realize the vast majority of our previously announced packaging segment
      price increases, and we expect higher containerboard and corrugated
      products shipments resulting from strong demand. White paper sales
      volumes should be seasonally higher, although price and mix should move
      lower. We also anticipate continued price inflation in recycled fiber
      and certain chemicals, higher freight costs and a higher tax rate.
      Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $1.68 per
      share. This does not include any potential additional costs or
      anticipated recoveries related to the Deridder Mill insurance claim.”
    

      We provide information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures
      and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures presented
      in this press release to the most comparable measure reported in
      accordance with GAAP in the schedules to this press release. We present
      our earnings expectation for the upcoming quarter excluding special
      items as special items are difficult to predict and quantify and may
      reflect the effect of future events. Additional special items may arise
      due to third quarter events.
    

      PCA is the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated
      packaging products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet
      paper in the United States. PCA operates eight mills and 93 corrugated
      products plants and related facilities.
    

      Some of the statements in this press release are forward-looking
      statements. Forward-looking statements include statements about our
      future earnings and financial condition, expected benefits from
      acquisitions and facility closures, our industry and our business
      strategy. Statements that contain words such as “ will”, “should”,
      “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “intend”, “estimate”, “hope” or
      similar expressions, are forward-looking statements. These
      forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of PCA.
      Because forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and
      uncertainties, the plans, actions and actual results of PCA could differ
      materially. Among the factors that could cause plans, actions and
      results to differ materially from PCA’s current expectations include the
      following: the impact of general economic conditions; conditions in the
      paper and packaging industries, including competition, product demand
      and product pricing; fluctuations in wood fiber and recycled fiber
      costs; fluctuations in purchased energy costs; the possibility of
      unplanned outages or interruptions at our principal facilities; and
      legislative or regulatory requirements, particularly concerning
      environmental matters, as well as those identified under Item 1A. Risk
      Factors in PCA’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
      31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available
      at the SEC’s website at “www.sec.gov”.

          Segment income (loss) excluding special items, earnings before
          interest, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and
          depletion (EBITDA), and EBITDA excluding special items are non-GAAP
          financial measures. Management excludes special items as it believes
          these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of
          operations of our business. We present these measures because they
          provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our
          company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by
          our management, because these measures assist in providing a
          meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these
          measures are frequently used by investors and other interested
          parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their
          segments. The tables included in "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
          Financial Measures" on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP
          measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Any
          analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be done only in
          conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The
          non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP
          financial measures and should not be used as such.

          believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing
          results of operations of our business. We present these measures
          because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our
          company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by
          our management, because these measures assist in providing a
          meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these
          measures are frequently used by investors and other interested
          parties in the evaluation of companies and their performance. Any
          analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be done only in
          conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The
          non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP
          financial measures and should not be used as such.

          Special items are tax-effected at a combined federal and state
          income tax rate in effect for the period the special items were
          recorded and this rate is adjusted for each subsequent quarter to be
          consistent with the estimated annual effective tax rate, in
          accordance with ASC 270, Interim Reporting, and ASC 740-270, Income
          Taxes – Intra Period Tax Allocation. For all periods presented,
          income taxes on special items represent the current amount of tax.
          For more information related to these items, see the footnotes to
          the Consolidated Earnings Results on page 1.
