Confident
In rough markets you need a solid philosophy. And the courage to follow it.

                Our commitment to value is steadfast, our belief in contrarian principles unwavering.
                So even when our approach is out of favor with the prevailing winds, we never question our ability to get our clients where they need to be over the long run.
              

Committed
When temptations to change course are at their worst, we're at our best.

                As committed value investors, we invest in established, structurally sound and well-managed companies whose intrinsic values are greater than the market gives them credit for.
                And when we find what we're looking for, we push boldly ahead.
              

Contrarian
The more we stand apart, the more our results stand out.

                We stand apart, not merely for the sake of being different, but because the popular thing to do is often not the smart thing do.
                We look to proven long-term strategies to maximize return on investment, and we go with what works, even if that means going our own way.

 Overview
Dreman Value Management, LLC, is a leading contrarian value
investment management firm.  Chairman David Dreman, a pioneer
in the field of contrarian investment strategies and behavioral
finance, began the current firm in 1997, after leading predecessor
firms dating back to 1977.  Since its founding, the firm has
consistently stayed true to the contrarian style of investing.


David Dreman: A Pioneer in Contrarian Investing
 Over the past 30 years, David Dreman has been at the forefront
 of research into contrarian value investing and behavioral finance,
 proving that over virtually every time period measured, stocks
 which were out of favor, as reflected by their price/earnings
 multiple, did significantly better than stocks considered to have
 more favorable outlooks. This research has led to five books on the
 topic. These works include Mr. Dreman's most recent book,  Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Psychological Edge, which was published on January 12, 2012 by Simon & Schuster.   His other widely acclaimed books were:
Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation, (1998), Psychology and the Stock Market, (1977);Contrarian Investment Strategy: The Psychology of Stock Market Success
 (1980); and The New Contrarian Investment Strategy, (1982). Articles dealing with the success of
 Mr. Dreman's methods have also appeared in many national
 publications, including  Money Magazine, Barron's,  The Wall Street Journal,
 The NewYork Times, Money and Fortune. Additionally, Mr.Dreman is a senior columnist for
 Forbes , where he has been writing a regularly published column, appropriately titled "
 The Contrarian," for over 30 years.


Value for today's investor
Today, Dreman Value Management's team of dedicated contrarians
is led by David Dreman, Founder, Chairman. As a boutique
investment firm, Dreman offers a true value solution to investors
seeking proper diversification and outstanding results. Our goal is
to provide superior investment performance over a long-term horizon
using the firm's unique contrarian investment philosophy and the
disciplined low P/E investment approach established by David Dreman
more than 30 years ago. The firm offers value-based equity
investment services to a variety of clients, including sub-advisory
services to Institutional, High Net Worth Individuals, Taft-Hartley and SMA/UMA
clients.  The firm also offers a domestically focused mutual fund strategy for
individual investors.  All of the strategies are
based on extensive research into undervalued equities.

The Potential Advantages of a Contrarian Strategy

David N. Dreman
David Greenberg
Full Analyst Team






Our Approach
Our investment team uses a disciplined, bottom-up, low P/E
approach to investing. We invest in companies with low P/Es that we
feel exhibit strong fundamentals and historical earnings growth,
and that our analysis indicates will persist over the long run.
We believe that cheap stocks have better downside protection
given their modest valuations relative to the respective
benchmark.


THE SELECTION PROCESS


Sell Discipline
Our sell discipline is as systematic as our selection process,
and benefits from our constant evaluation of the stocks in our
funds, both relative to themselves and their industries.  



 We will sell or trim positions when:  





A stock's valuation rises above the market.

A stock's valuation exceeds that of its industry.

A stock experiences weak or declining price momentum and/or
deteriorating fundamentals.


Risk Management
We believe true risk is the potential for a permanent loss of
capital assuming an appropriate time horizon. Volatility is not
true risk. We attempt to mitigate true risk in three ways: (1)
Valuation risk-don't overpay for a stock. (2) Earnings power
risk-earnings power is temporarily and not structurally impacted.
(3) Balance sheet/financial risk-make sure the balance sheet is
strong enough to weather market volatility.

        DWS Investments International Value Fund Changes Adviser, Strategy, Branding
      

          The DWS International Value Opportunities Fund will be rebranded, and the fund’s directors and shareholders have approved a new fund sub-adviser.

      Nevin E. Adams, JD

      June 21, 2010
       
















  


  

  
  
  




According to the announcement, DWS Investments, the US retail unit of Deutsche Bank’s global Asset Management division, said that the Board of Directors and shareholders of the DWS International Value Opportunities Fund have approved a resolution appointing Dreman Value Management L.L.C. (“DVM”) as the fund’s sub-advisor.  Moreover, the DWS International Value Opportunities Fund will be rebranded the DWS Dreman International Value Fund and will be managed by Cliff Hoover, Dreman’s co-chief investment officer and noted fund manager. Hoover joined Dreman Value Management as co-chief investment officer in 2006 with over 20 years investments experience. Prior to joining Dreman, Hoover served as lead portfolio manager on Allianz NFJ International Value Fund (ticker: AFJAX) since its inception in January 2003.  Since then he has served as lead portfolio manager on Dreman Value Management’s international value and all-cap products. He started an institutional composite international value composite in October 2007 and has been lead portfolio manager on Dreman Contrarian International Value Fund (ticker: DRIVX) since its inception in 2008. The new DWS Dreman International Value Fund will reflect three significant changes to its investment strategy, according to a press release: a change of benchmark from the MSCI EAFE Index to the Russell Global ex-US Value Index, permitted exposure to emerging markets now increases from 20% to 50%, andthe use of ADRs to obtain greater foreign exposure will increase. Overall changes to the DWS Dreman International Value Fund’s investment strategy and portfolio management team, “reflect DWS' dedication to providing clients with first class managers, be it through our internal centers of excellence or by hiring proven sub-advisors such as Dreman Value Management,” said Ingo Gefeke, Global Head of Distribution and Product Management at DWS Investments. Hoover's approach to international value portfolio management will include the same strict buy and sell discipline, as well as focus on risk mitigation utilized by the DWS Dreman Small Cap Value and DWS Dreman Mid Cap Value funds, according to the firm.

Dreman Contrarian Value Equity Fund Launched
May 5, 2011 (PLANSPONSOR.com) - Dreman Value Management L.L.C., a contrarian value asset management company, has announced the launch of the Dreman Contrarian Value Equity Fund.
By Rebecca Moore editors@plansponsor.com | May 05, 2011 






















  














The new fund will be managed by E. Clifton "Cliff" Hoover, Jr., who last September succeeded David Dreman as the firm's Chief Investment Officer, and Wesley D. Wright. With an investment objective of long-term capital appreciation, the performance target for the Dreman Contrarian Value Equity Fund is to exceed the Russell 3000 Value Index over a full market cycle.  According to a press release, while the fund's composition and market capitalization range is subject to change from time to time, the portfolio managers expect to invest in 45 to 55 U.S. stocks of any capitalization.   The announcement said the Value Equity Fund, which will be offered in three Classes -- A, C, and Institutional -- may be a suitable investment for long-term investors seeking a fund with a long-term capital appreciation investment strategy, investors willing to accept price fluctuations in their investment, and investors who can tolerate the general risks associated with common stock investments.
