Welcome
I’m an attorney turned fiction writer currently focusing my writings on sites and artifacts that evidence pre-Columbian exploration of America. I call this the “Templars in America” series as much of this exploration seems to tie back to the medieval Knights Templar. In the books I use artifacts and historical sites to trigger modern-day suspense plots. As Publisher Weekly writes of the series, “Brody does a terrific job of wrapping his research in a fast-paced thrill ride.”
I remain fascinated by the hidden history of North America and the very real possibility that waves of European explorers visited our shores long before Columbus. It is my hope that readers share this fascination.

Unlawful Deeds

Bruce Arrujo, professional art thief. Bruce Arrujo, Attorney-at-Law. Recently hired by Boston’s most prestigious law firm.
The reason for his career change? Boston’s red-hot real estate market has suddenly crashed, and Bruce figures that some of his new firm’s institutional clients won’t notice if a couple of million dollars is siphoned away during the resulting chaos.
But the police definitely notice when a local art museum is robbed of $100 million in art. And they definitely notice when a transvestite prostitute is found strangled in a Back Bay alley.
Is Bruce behind one or both of these crimes? Or has he, instead, become the unwitting puppet of an unseen adversary? And when a stunning young Harvard Law School student gets dragged into the mess, will Bruce betray his love for her in order to ensure his own fortune?
At stake? Millions of dollars. A lifetime in jail. The love of his life.

Powdered Gold
BOOK #3 IN THE “TEMPLARS IN AMERICA” SERIES
Cam and Amanda don’t for a second believe the Ark of the Covenant is hidden in a cave in the Arizona desert. But when a militant Survivalist leads them to a radioactive replica of the Ark, filled with a mysterious white powder, they begin to wonder if legends of Templar Knights visiting the American Southwest on a secret mission might be true. What is this strange white powder? And is it the key to understanding the true power of both Moses and the sacred Ark of the Covenant?

The Oath of Nimrod
BOOK #4 IN THE “TEMPLARS IN AMERICA” SERIES
A mysterious race of North American giants.
An ancient Hebrew inscription in a Cherokee burial mound.
A blood oath made by blindfolded Freemasons.
Are these three historical oddities the reason the CIA is trying to brainwash historian Cameron Thorne and his fiancée Amanda Spencer-Gunn? The answer lies buried in the legends of the Knights Templar, within the rituals of the secretive Freemasons and, most significantly of all, inside the bowels of the Smithsonian Institution. The problem for Cam and Amanda? If they go rummaging around the Smithsonian, they may find themselves buried alongside the ancient giants.

Thief on the Cross
BOOK #2 IN THE “TEMPLARS IN AMERICA” SERIES
Why would a collector of ancient American artifacts hand over his prized pieces to a historian and then shoot himself in the head? And why does an ancient Templar scroll in his possession refer to Jesus Christ as “The Thief on the Cross?”
The answer places historian Cameron Thorne at the dangerous intersection of secret American history and modern geopolitical intrigue. Following clues contained in ancient American artifacts and medieval European masterpieces, Cameron and his fiancée Amanda Spencer race to uncover the true secrets of early Christianity before a splinter group of Mormon zealots silences them forever.
Just as they did in Cabal of the Westford Knight: Templars at the Newport Tower, Cameron and Amanda discover, examine and interpret ancient artifacts and legends scattered throughout North America that reveal a history of European exploration long before Columbus. But how do the Burrows Cave stone carvings, the Bat Creek Stone, the Prince Madoc legend, the Book of Mormon and the Mandan tribe of “White Indians” relate to the medieval Templars? Only when they learn about the head of Baphomet and examine Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Virgin on the Rocks do the pieces finally begin to fit together.
What they learn shocks them. And may get them killed.
WARNING: This book contains themes that may be offensive to readers with strong Christian or other religious beliefs.

David Brody Fires Back at Jim Acosta’s ‘The Fix is In’

















By Chris Ariens on Feb. 16, 2017 - 9:13 AMComment


CNN’s Jim Acosta believes “the fix is in.” He said as much to Wolf Blitzer yesterday after, for the third consecutive news conference, Pres. Trump only called on media outlets perceived to be sympathetic to his goals. 
As the president and Prime Minister Netanyahu left the podium at that news conference, Acosta shouted a question to Trump about any potential ties to Russia. The president didn’t answer.
One of those who was called on was David Brody the veteran White House reporter for CBN, which was founded by Pat Robertson, the former Southern Baptist minister and host of The 700 Club.
“I was fully aware that the mainstream media would go into meltdown mode when I was called on first,” Brody writes in his story headlined, “This Just In From CNN: More Fake News!”
“The fact that the president called on me and not on any of the traditional media outlets is really what is bothering all of them. They feel entitled to ask a question but the last time I checked, I only see the First Amendment in the U.S. Constitution. I don’t see the, ‘Mainstream Media Entitlement Clause’ inside.”
What Jim Acosta said on CNN Wednesday is insanely ridiculous (I used those words in a southern, ‘Bless your heart’ tone).  Acosta’s beef may be with The White House and not necessarily outlets like CBN but to lump us in and attach that phrase to us is reckless, downright wrong and insulting. If the, “fix was in” then there would have been dialogue about how to ask the right question. There was never any of that.

      “In the end, I think the local legends and traditions tell the true story. Written history reflects the beliefs or opinions or agenda of the writer. Local legends and tradition are more universal, less malleable—as you said, they tell us the beliefs of millions. They are often the most accurate versions of history.”

 Westford "Stone Sanctum"?


Visited an intriguing site in Westford, MA this weekend with Scott Wolter and his wife Janet. The site is comprised of a series of white rocks arranged in a specific pattern that appears to be ceremonial. The arrangement looks like a dandelion after it has turned white, with a stem (in this case 8 white rocks arranged in a row) leading to an orb (in this case a circle of white rocks). In the center of the circle is a large white boulder. The arrangement is oriented west to east, in the

 America's Stonehenge Revisited


I originally posted this discussion a few years ago, focusing on the fascinating summer solstice sunrise alignment connecting America's Stonehenge (North Salem, NH) to Stonehenge England and then to the Phoenician homeland of Lebanon. I now want to update: It turns out that the alignment continues, as we theorized, to the ancient Phoenician homeland at a site located in the Golan Heights in what is now Israel. The site is called Israeli Stonehenge and is also known as Gilgal Refai

 Update on Tucson Lead Artifacts


Those who read my novel Powdered Gold will recall the controversy over the Tucson lead artifacts discovered in the 1920s. Scott Wolter and other geologists have examined them and concluded that, based on the geology, the artifacts are at least many hundreds of years old, validating their 8th Century AD dating. But some Latin scholars have analyzed the inscriptions and concluded they were lifted from modern Latin textbooks by a hoaxer. Recently an expert on medieval Latin

 Masons, Druids and Washington, DC


The American patriot Thomas Paine, author of Common Sense,wrote also about the Freemasons, though less famously.  Freemasonry, he stated, “is derived and is the remains of the religion of the ancient Druids, who, like the magi of Persiaand the priests of Heliopolis in Egypt, were priests of the sun.”  I had never before associated Masonry with the Druids, but the idea of the Masons, Druids and Egyptian priests being connected through sun worship makes sense to anyone who has toured the

 Narragansett Rune Stone, the Vinland Map, and Coincidence


I'm not a big believer in coincidence. With that in mind, I'll throw this out there and let people react to it:

1. In 1959 a wealthy banker by the name of Paul Mellon purchased the famous Vinland Map, purportedly for a million dollars, and donated it to Yale University. The map, if authentic, dates to the early 1400s.

2. In 2012, the Narragansett Rune Stone disappeared, taken from Narragansett Bay. The artifact was later recovered through the efforts of R

 Oak Island Petroglyph

Lenik's book, Picture Rocks (University Press of New England 2002), at page 29.  This is also known as the Bedford Barrens glyph:

 Templar Ruins and the Newport Tower


While in Scotland recently, I visited the ruins of St. Anthony's Chapel in Holyrood Park. This chapel is believed to have been built by the Knights Templar in the 1300s. I was struck by the architectural similarities between the chapel and Rhode Island's Newport Tower, also believed by some (including myself) to have been built by the Templars. Note especially the window shape/design and the arch design.

 Rosslyn Chapel & Westford Knight


One of the pieces of evidence often cited in proving the authenticity of the Prince Henry Sinclair journey to North America in 1398 (and the related Westford Knight carving) is the existence of various North American flora carved on the walls and ceiling of the iconic Rosslyn Chapel.  The Chapel was built in 1456 by Henry Sinclair's grandson, William Sinclair, and the thought is that William possessed drawings of flora from his grandfather's journey.

 Westford Knight--Head?


This post is, admittedly, less than scientific. But for years I have been visiting the Westford Knight carving and have never really clearly seen the "head" of the Knight. The sword is clear, but for the head and body and shield I sort of have to squint my eyes and use my imagination. Then last week I received a bunch of photos and, voila, there he was, staring up from the rock. Here is the image, plus a drawing (very rough, sorry) showing what it is I see:

 Update: Hooked X on Westford Knight Carving


In late June I posted some images of what appear to be a Hooked X or Forked X on the Westford Knight carving. On August 31 researcher Jerry Lutgen, along with geologist Scott Wolter, came to Westford to photograph and examine the mark.  I won't try to describe Jerry's work other than to say he uses digital imaging to create 3D images and models of the carvings he studies.  Here is a color image of the Hooked X mark:

 1325 Date on Newport Tower?

 Hooked X on Westford Knight Carving?


As part of the Westford Knight preservation project, Westford firefighter David Christiana, along with Shane Greenslade, recently thoroughly cleaned the Knight carving.  While examining it, they noticed a small carving a few inches to the east of the blade of the sword that may be a mark commonly referred to as the Hooked X or Forked X.  The carving appears to be weathered and at a depth comparable to the sword carving.  On either side of the X can be found single d

 Bat Creek Stone and America Unearthed


I've received a number of queries asking for my reaction to the America Unearthed episode featuring the Bat Creek Stone ("Lost Relics of the Bible").

 Rock Bottom


I spend a lot of time with fellow researchers in the woods, examining rock formations and carvings. Sometimes we get a bit overzealous and misinterpret natural formations as manmade.

 Narragansett Rune Stone Recovered


Approximately one year ago the Narragansett Rune Stone was stolen, the multi-ton boulder hoisted out of Narragansett Bay under the cloak of darkness. A few months ago the Rhode Island authorities secured the return of the artifact; it now sits in a warehouse at the URI campus in Narragansett. Recently we were given permission to film the artifact for the movie adaptation of "Cabal of the Westford Knight." Here are some images of the boulder and the carving, including the forklift marks

 Narragansett Rune Stone Recovered


Happy to report that the Narragansett Rune Stone has been recovered by RI authorities working with the RI Attorney General. The artifact, a large boulder sitting in Narragansett Bay, had been removed/stolen last summer, purportedly by an abutting land owner who apparently didn't appreciate its possible connections to ancient exploration of the area. The good news is that, now that the boulder is on land, the artifact can be preserved and studied. Here's a short article:

 America's Stonehenge on America Unearthed


Happy to see H2's "America Unearthed" show did such a good job with the America's Stonehenge episode that aired this weekend (and will re-air over the coming weeks).

The son of the owners of the site, Kelsey Stone, has done some fascinating work showing how the summer so

 Review of "American Unearthed" Episode #1


I watched the premier episode of H2's "America Unearthed," starring Scott Wolter, last weekend. I had been involved in the early planning for this series and was hopeful it would help open the public's eyes to the possibility of exploration of America before Columbus.

I was, therefore, disappointed in this review, which criticizes the show, its research,the pacing and Wolter personally:

Exploring Altered States with David Brody  David Brody’s Art is Surreal and Psychedelic


by  Emily Manke  | October 1, 2015
 
Seattle is a city brimming with artists. So, in order to standout and make a name for yourself, you have to be different. And David Brody has managed to do just that. The professor of Painting and Drawing at University of Washington has been making his mark on the Seattle art scene for the better part of the last two decades. It seems like Brody’s trippy work is a perfect fit for Seattle’s psychedelic scene.
The timeline of Brody’s work tells the story of his evolution as an artist. On Brody’s site, his work is separated into time periods. From 1985-1994, Brody’s work is brightly colored and surreal. With human and non-human subjects, in sometimes dreamlike scenarios found throughout the work. Next, from 1995- 2006, Brody’s work began to really take shape, the realism element becoming finely tuned. It seems that this era begins with work that draws inevitable comparisons to Salvador Dalí. During this time period, Brody took his profound eye for color and detail and applied it to portraits of various female subjects and even body parts. His most recent body of work took a somewhat sharp turn. Instead of realism with human subjects, the new work plays with shapes and patterns in a style with an almost textile-like, tangible feel. The geometric, vibrant nature of the work could certainly be described as hallucinogenic.
The man behind the brilliant work was kind enough to answer some questions for CULTURE.


 
When and how did you get started as an artist?
Like most kids, I drew when I was young. I just never stopped.
Where are you from?
Born in New York City. Spent most of my life on the East Coast. Came out here in 1996 to take a job as a professor of painting at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Which artists have influenced your work?
So many. Everything from European cave paintings, to Attic ceramics, to Song Dynasty Chinese scroll paintings, to all the greats of the western canon, to contemporary cartoonists and animators.
Which artists have you been inspired by, that you believe may have been inspired by cannabis, or whose art is psychedelic in some way?
I don’t know about what’s been inspired by cannabis specifically, but there is a lot of great surrealistic and psychedelic art and animation. Rene Magritte’s work often has a dreamlike hallucinatory quality. Some artists, like Peter Saul and Ed Paschke come to mind, too. And R. Crumb’s a great draftsman who’s done a lot of work that reflects on psychedelic drug culture.
