Efflorescence Issues









Efflorescence Issues
For Professional Use Only 


What is EFFLORESCENCE?
            Efflorescence is often described as a white or ivory  chalk-like deposit. Efflorescence is formed by water migrating through the  masonry wall and out the pores. As it passes through the wall, it collects  loose salt and lime and brings them to the surface. As the water evaporates,  the salt or lime particles bond to the wall causing white stains.
Several products can be used to remove efflorescence. NMD 80 at  a (4:1) dilution. When using NMD 80 for post construction cleaning, removing  mortar smears, NMD 80 will not cause cleanup efflorescence. 
            Ef-Fortless (undiluted)  is formulated for one purpose which is to remove efflorescence (calcium chloride). EF-Fortless is a soap solution  that counteracts efflorescence.
 Not  every "white stain" on a wall is efflorescence!

Calcite (calcium carbonate) will appear as a thick whitish deposit that usually forms  over time. Calcite most commonly forms when excess moisture passes through the  mortar joints, evaporating leaving behind white deposits on brick. Â For removing calcite use Calcite Presoak  followed with NMD 80.

Lime  Run (calcium hydroxide) occurs as a steady release of calcium soaked water that  creates a streak. Generally, lime run is treated just like calcite. When it is  caught early enough, the normal wash process of NMD 80 (4:1) will be effective  enough to remove it. For removing lime run the same procedure is used as  removing calcite use Calcite Presoak followed with NMD 80.

White  Scum (calcium silicate) is a result from improper use of new masonry cleaner,  reacting with brick and forming insoluble salts. This is created by un-buffered  acid combining with silicates and clay. For removing white scum use White Scum  Presoak followed with NMD 80. 

Integral  Water Repellent can sometimes bleed out of the brick or block, leaving behind a  "white haze" that has very similar appearance to efflorescence or  white scum; however the removal process is completely different. For removing  use OneRestore (undiluted).                
 Admixtures in mortar can bleed out leaving a white stain that can appear above and below  the mortar joints. It looks similar to calcite and lime run. For removal use  OneRestore followed with NMD 80.

Sealers applied incorrectly or failing can look white too. Knowing the type of sealer  is helpful to find the correct remover. Not knowing the type of sealer, a  variety of products needs to be tested to find the correct remover.

                        
As  you can see by the pictures below, not all white stains are the same. While  some of them appear to be very similar, a simple test with water will help you  determine if you have efflorescence or another variety of white stain. Simply  spray water on an affected area. If the stain disappears when wet and  re-appears when dry, it might be efflorescence. If the stain is still visible,  it may not be efflorescence.
Product specification sheets must be read for the details on  ‘’how to use”. Always test prior to beginning full  scale cleaning operations. Testing should confirm cleaning effectiveness on  each type of surface and stain designated to be removed. Also test to deÂ­termine  the desired surface contact time and any potential for adverse reactions with  adjacent materials. Allow test panels to dry thoroughly before evaluating final  appearance and results.
