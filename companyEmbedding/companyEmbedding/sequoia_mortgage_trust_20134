NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-10, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-10 (SEMT 
      2013-10):
    

      --$371,622,000 class A-1 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-2 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-3 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-4 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf';

      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-6 exchangeable 
      certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-7 
      exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$371,622,000 
      class A-8 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO1 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO2 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO3 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$371,622,000 
      class A-IO notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$10,217,000 
      class B-1 certificate 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$6,811,000 class 
      B-2 certificate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$4,608,000 class B-3 
      certificate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$3,205,000 non-offered class 
      B-4 certificate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.25% 
      subordination provided by the 2.55% class B-1, 1.70% class B-2, 1.15% 
      class B-3, 0.80% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The $4,208,564 non-offered class B-5 certificates will not be rated by 
      Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, CitiMortgage, Inc. will act as 
      the master servicer and Wilmington Trust will act as the Trustee for the 
      transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made to 
      treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-10 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's tenth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans. All of the loans 
      are fully amortizing. The aggregate pool included loans originated from 
      PrimeLending (8.5%) and WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital (7.6%). The 
      remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage 
      lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 529 loans with a 
      total balance of $400,671,564; an average balance of $757,413; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 68.1%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.9%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 45.5% and 5.0% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 775. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 95.2% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (40.9%), 
      Texas (9.4%) and Virginia (6.7%).
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists of 30-year 
      fully amortizing, fully documented FRMs to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles, low leverage, and substantial liquid reserves. Third-party 
      loan-level due diligence was conducted on 99.8% of the pool, and Fitch 
      believes the results of the review generally indicate strong 
      underwriting controls.
    

      Originators with Limited Performance History: The majority of the pool 
      was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. 
      The lack of performance history is partially mitigated by the 100% 
      third-party diligence conducted on these loans that resulted in 
      immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit enhancement (CE) on 
      this transaction sufficient to mitigate the originator risk.
    

      Geographically Diverse Pool: The collateral pool is geographically 
      diverse. The percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas 
      (MSAs) is 23.1% and concentration in California is 40.9%, similar to 
      recent SEMT transactions. The agency did not apply a default penalty to 
      the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk.
    

      Transaction Provisions Enhance Deal Framework: The representation, 
      warranty and enforcement mechanism framework is viewed positively, as it 
      is consistent with Fitch criteria. As in other recent Fitch-rated SEMT 
      transactions, SEMT 2013-10 contains binding arbitration provisions that 
      may serve to provide timely resolution to representation and warranty 
      disputes. In addition, all loans that become 120 days or more delinquent 
      will be reviewed for breaches of representations and warranties.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    

      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions, Fitch's sustainable home price (SHP) model 
      does not project declines in home prices. This region is 
      Dallas-Plano-Irving in Texas (4.3%). Fitch conducted sensitivity 
      analysis assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% compared with those 
      projected by Fitch's SHP model for this region. The sensitivity analysis 
      indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    

      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 13.7%, slightly less than the 14.5% base sMVD projected 
      in the current model.
    

      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model-projected 14.5% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-10'.

      class B-3, 0.55% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The $6,054,465 non-offered class B-5 certificates will not be rated by 
      Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and Christiana Trust will act as the Trustee for 
      the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made 
      to treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment 
      conduits (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-4 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's fourth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans. The loans are 
      predominantly fully amortizing; however, 2.2% have a 10-year 
      interest-only (IO) period. The aggregate pool included loans originated 
      from First Republic Bank (11.3%), Cole Taylor Bank (8.5%), PrimeLending 
      (7.9%), United Shore Financial Services (6.2%) and Fremont Bank (5.3%). 
      The remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage 
      lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 716 loans with a 
      total balance of $576,435,465; an average balance of $805,077; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 64.9%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.8%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 68.2% and 9% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 773. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 96% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (42.1%), 
      Massachusetts (9.7%), and Washington (7.2%).
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists primarily of 
      30-year fixed-rate fully documented loans to borrowers with strong 
      credit profiles, low leverage, and substantial liquid reserves. The 
      majority of the loans are fully amortizing, with only nine loans (2.2% 
      of the pool) having a 10-year interest-only (IO) period. Third-party 
      loan-level due diligence was conducted on approximately 92% of the 
      overall pool, and Fitch believes the results of the review generally 
      indicate strong underwriting controls.
    

      Originators with Limited Performance History: Approximately 89% of the 
      pool was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance 
      history. While the significant contribution of loans from these 
      originators is a concern, Fitch believes the lack of performance history 
      is partially mitigated by the 100% third-party diligence conducted on 
      these loans that resulted in immaterial findings. Fitch also considers 
      the credit enhancement (CE) on this transaction sufficient to mitigate 
      the originator risk.
    

      Geographically Diverse Pool: The overall geographic diversity is in line 
      with other SEMT transactions. The percentage of the top three 
      metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) is 25%, the second lowest 
      concentration to date. Fitch applied a 1.05x default penalty to the pool 
      to account for the geographic concentration risk.
    

      Transaction Provisions Enhance Performance: As in other recent SEMT 
      transactions rated by Fitch, SEMT 2013-4 contains binding arbitration 
      provisions that may serve to provide timely resolution to representation 
      and warranty disputes. In addition, all loans that become 120 days or 
      more delinquent will be reviewed for breaches of representations and 
      warranties.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    

      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions, Fitch's sustainable home price (SHP) model 
      does not project declines in home prices and for another, the projected 
      decline is less than 2.00%. These regions are Chicago-Joliet-Naperville 
      in Illinois (4.2%) and Cambridge-Newton-Framingham in Massachusetts 
      (4.6%). Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, 
      and 20% compared with those projected by Fitch's SHP model for these 
      regions. The sensitivity analysis indicated no impact on ratings for all 
      bonds in each scenario.
    

      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 13% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-4'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.
    

      In addition to the information sources identified in Fitch's criteria 
      listed below, Fitch's analysis incorporated data tapes, due diligence 
      results, deal structure and legal documents from the 17g5 website

BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Suited Connector has received 4.54 out of 5 stars based on 10 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
