This powerful software guides you through the process from beginning to end, giving you the practical and legal information you need to make the best decisions for you and your family.


    The benefits of using Quicken WillMaker Plus include:

An easy-to-use interview format that lets you complete documents at your own pace
A user-friendly legal manual to answer common questions
A team of lawyer-editors working to ensure each document reflects the laws of your state*


Quicken WillMaker Plus is the original will-writing software, created and updated regularly by Nolo’s experts. Free legal updates will keep your program current through 2017. Technical support is also available.


    Plus, get a free living trust and five other valuable online documents! Registering your copy of Quicken WillMaker Plus 2017 gives you a free one-year subscription to Nolo's Online Living Trust. In addition, you get free one-year subscriptions to five other valuable online forms: Nolo's Promissory Note, Limited Power of Attorney for Finances, Temporary Guardianship Authorization for Minor, Authorization for Minor's Medical Treatment, and Authorization for Foreign Travel.


    Want to know more? Here’s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus:




Will: 

    The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a “personal representative”) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. With Quicken WillMaker Plus, you can revise and update your will whenever you like.


Also, use Quicken WillMaker Plus 2017 to give your executor authority over your digital assets, including social media accounts, online banking and more.


Health Care Directive: 
    Spare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions:


Health Care Power of Attorney:  Name a trusted person (your "health care agent") to make important medical decisions for you if necessary.
Living Will:  State what types of medical treatment you do or do not want if you are too ill or injured to direct your own care. Your health care providers must do all they can to follow your wishes.



Durable Power of Attorney for Finances: 
    A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your "agent" or "attorney-in-fact") will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. You can also give your attorney-in-fact authority over your digital assets.


Documents for Your Executor: 
    Make sure your executor has all the forms and instructions necessary to do the job: checklists, letters, notices and claim forms.


Final Arrangements: 
    Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more.


Information for Caregivers and Survivors: 
    Organize your information so that your survivors don't have to. Use these documents to give them details about everything from bank accounts, to passwords, to the names of people you'd like contacted in the event of your illness or death.


Letter to Survivors: 
    Use the Letter to Survivors to leave your loved ones detailed explanations about your decisions. For example, you may want to let them know why you made certain gifts or named a particular person to be your executor. You can also use your letter to leave some general thoughts about your life.


Living Trust: 
    Ensure that your property bypasses lengthy and expensive probate proceedings.


Personal Finance Documents: 
    Over a dozen forms let you handle common financial situations, such as lending or borrowing money between friends or family, creating a bill of sale, and closing a credit card account.


Home & Family Documents: 
    Practical forms you can use every day to help run your home and keep your family safe, including authorizations and agreements, promissory notes, limited powers of attorney, and child and elder care forms.


*Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana, U.S. Territories or Canada.

 Good stuff WillMaker 2017 by Drew F. 









                                                  I do like this product.  In about 4 hours I completed all documents for three family members.   Thanks for making the process so easy.                (Posted on 7/23/2017)




 Everyone should use it ! by Barbara B. 









                                                  Informative, great flow through steps, additional information available!                (Posted on 7/10/2017)




 Review by James S. 









                                                  Easy to use and a diy solution which makes financial estate planning quite simple,                (Posted on 7/8/2017)




 Just what the Dr. ordered by Gregory S. 









                                                  My wife and I had been holding off writing wills due to the complexity of a blended family.  The program worked well for our needs and security of our family.                (Posted on 7/4/2017)




 Review by Michael S. 









                                                  Quick, user friendly program in all areas. Would recommend to anyone and much cheaper than having a lawyer do it if your estate is simple.                (Posted on 7/2/2017)




 A monkey can make a Will  by Paul S. 









                                                  Much easier than expected. Took me about 15 minutes to complete a Will.  There were 3 beneficiaries and I wished I could break down by "percentages" instead of fractions.                 (Posted on 6/29/2017)




 Please stop using fractions by Craig R. 









                                                  It does the job for straightforward, simple wills but I wish they would use percentages instead of fractions for how you want to leave your estate.                (Posted on 6/28/2017)




 Worth the money! by Thomas M. 









                                                  Is very comprehensive!                (Posted on 6/26/2017)




 Great software by Alexander H. 









                                                  Nolo’s Quicken WillMaker Plus is a nice software, neatly organized with step by step guidance provided by their tutorial. It will help if you spend some time before you use this product and gather all your personal information, your financial statements, and have them ready before you start making your WillMaker documents. It worked well for us. 
P.S. Please visit your local, county, government website for videos and important information regarding the law, rules and regulations in the state you are living in, THE SURROGATE COURT, PROBATE, WILLS, POWER OF ATTORNEY, ADVANCE DIRECTIVES, INTESTACY, NOTICE OF PROBATE etc.. 
Thank you Nolo.

 Needed a will ASAP. by Jimmy D. 









                                                  Don't waste your time with the FREE online wills. They aren't Free.

 Good program for the money. by GT 









                                                  I like the program with one exception. The loss of inputted data when going back to a previous screen for a correction or change. Can be irritating. I'm sure there is a good reason for this and there may be a "work around"                (Posted on 6/16/2017)




 Happy Quicken WillMaker user by Beverly M. 









                                                  Sorry for the delay.  I had downloaded it to my MAC and I am a new MAC user.  After I downloaded it I couldn't find it.  Finally found it.  I totally would recommend quicken WillMaker Plus 2017 to everyone.  I have used it before but have recently moved to another state so have to start over.  It is very user friendly and thorough.                (Posted on 6/15/2017)

 Review by Anonymous 









                                                  The program doesn't allow the summary page to be printed, which is a big problem when meeting with an estate planning attorney. A lot of time is wasted going through the draft will, when the summary could have easily answered the attorney's questions as he has his own information gathering checklist. The property asset worksheet is ok, but the layout could be better, to list joint assets, IRAs, life insurance,  etc. and the beneficiary chain that are set up that override the will.                 (Posted on 6/13/2017)




 in maryland by Anonymous 









                                                  live in Maryland. created a will and passed it by my attorney. He made some minor modifications basically terms that are no longer used. I suggest that the makers update their program to reflect the latest terms used. Otherwise very easy to use.                (Posted on 6/12/2017)




 Awesome Recommendation  by Anonymous 









                                                  A financial advisor recommended "Willmaker" and it was not only easy but exactly what I wanted...a very simple will.  The added details on distribution were very helpful and the price unbeatable. 
An awesome tip from the financial advisor.

 Includes all you need by Impatient  









                                                  Very comprehensive.  Included many details I would not have thought of.  I had a little trouble printing only the pages I wanted and not the extensive instructions at the beginning of each section. The best of the several types of will software I have tried.                (Posted on 6/10/2017)

 the format is restrictive by Anonymous 









                                                  The program has built-in inflexibility. This means that you cannot alter the document from the format that the program offers this is often very awkward and does not flow smoothly as you navigate through the One Direction it allows you to so you cannot make a will in any original fashion and add items or add any contingencies. What you must do if you want to customize the will is printed out as the program offers it then you must download it into a Word program and then you can alter the text and the format the way you want                (Posted on 6/3/2017)

                                                  I can't give my review a "5",  because I'm in the first phase of creating my will - one day. BUT, before today, my will was the lame - just, my possesions got to ..... Using WillMaker provided me a framework to know that my wishes would be expressed legally. Now, I feel comfortable that my wishes have been expressed legally.                (Posted on 6/2/2017)

I would definitely use this software again if I had to do it all over again.  Of course, ill have to use it for updates on my will,  but i would pick it again.

 Helped me consolidate and simplify by Anonymous 









                                                  Quicken WillMaker Plus 2017 is a very good product.  My wife and I needed to update our wills.  WillMaker makes that very easy.  But I discovered that a number of other documents (MS Word and MS Excel) I had created for the executor and for the funeral home could be consolidated within the WillMaker program.  I pasted a good deal of information into WillMaker and then deleted unneeded Word and Excel files.  Most of my information is now in one place - WillMaker.  Our family is in constant fluctuation.  Future revisions will be necessary and will be easier.  My wife and I decided that we need to review our will and all of our estate information on a yearly basis.  In the end, my executor will appreciate having all the information in one place, one format, and up-to-date.                (Posted on 5/18/2017)

 Software that meets all needs! by Anonymous 









                                                  I owned a previous version of this software which I purchased in 2003. The 2003 version was a MS Dos version not working on Apple OS. I own a Mac Book Pro and up until 2017 there was no good alternative as my old software was not compatible. Now with the 2017 version it works on both formats. Works great. More info built into the program.                 (Posted on 5/16/2017)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

State Street Global Index Plus Trust






Investment Objective

The State Street Global Index Plus Trust ("the Fund") seeks an investment return that modestly exceeds, before expenses, the performance of the MSCI World ex-Australia Index over the long term.



Investment Approach

The Fund invests in listed international securities selected from the MSCI World ex-Australia Index. Four principles drive our investment process:

• Investors can take advantage of market inefficiencies through a disciplined application of a systematic, analytical investment process.
• The Fund uses more than one strategy designed to take advantage of market inefficiencies to help produce more consistent, investment performance over the long term. We rank companies in the index using factors such as earnings growth, valuation and investor sentiment.
• Risk control is an integral part of our investment process.  The Fund maintains overall risk, style, and size characteristics similar to those of the benchmark.
• Our investment process is based on economic and financial analysis which is continuously updated to adapt over time.

The Fund’s investment strategy may include the use of options, futures and other derivatives to reduce risk or gain market exposure when necessary to do so. These instruments are not used speculatively, and are never used to gear the Fund.
