Our Philosophy










We believe that investors can earn a premium return in small capitalization growth equities by identifying higher quality companies capable of growing through multiple business cycles. We seek to take advantage of the inefficient discovery process for small companies and other investors’ focus on near-term earnings.
Key Tenets of Our Style
•  We build Small Cap portfolios consisting of 45 to 50 stocks and SMid Cap portfolios consisting of 40 to 60 stocks. Portfolios are invested in companies which we believe offer high-quality sustainable growth, diversified across economic sectors.
•  We take a long-term investment horizon which results in a low portfolio turnover rate of approximately 30%.
•  We seek to provide attractive risk and reward characteristics relative to benchmarks and other Small or SMid capitalization growth managers.

	An Interview With Conestoga Capital



	By Andy Cross


	September 30, 2010


	Conestoga Capital Advisors is group of small-cap investor cut straight from the Hidden Gems cloth. (They're HG members, too!) The group invests in companies with robust earnings growth, strong cash positions, solid market share, and smart, ethical, successful management teams. Last week I chatted with Duane D'Orazio, who I've known for years, and a fellow managing partner, Bob Mitchell. What follows are a few key takeaways from our discussion (via a lightly edited transcript), with my own thoughts sprinkled in. (My comments are in italics.)



	Conestoga Capital's approach



	The investment philosophy, the process has stayed very consistent through all the years. ... One of our strengths is that we stick to what we do, and we don't deviate based on the flavor of the day or what the markets are doing.


	We look for really good-quality small-cap companies and look to invest with them for a number of years. It takes us a long time to get comfortable, and then once we make that decision, we hope to be in the name for a period of time.


	We like to have a turnover ratio of less than 30%, and I would say historically, in the last three or four years, it's probably been below 20%.




	AC:



	For context, most mutual funds hold stocks for less than a year, meaning they have annual turnover north of 100%.



	Our separate account composite goes back to 1999. We started the

	Conestoga Small Cap Fund

	(CCASX) in October of 2002, [and it's] managed the exact same way as our separate account historical product was managed.




	AC:



	Since inception, Capital Advisors has returned 8.5% annualized versus 4.6% for the Russell 2000. The small-cap fund is up 8.2% vs. 8.1% for the Russell 2000. Conestoga invests in long positions only; no shorting.




	Small-cap conservative growth investing and reducing volatility



	One of the things that we try to emphasize in our process, or our philosophy, is that we try to reduce the volatility. Our companies are strong, fundamental companies that have nice cash positions. When times get tough, they don't get hit as hard as the market, so we're not capturing the downside. On the upside, we just try to keep pace with the market versus the typical momentum of small-cap managers that we see in our space.


	We view ourselves as a small-cap conservative growth investor. Often the volatility associated with small-cap growth stocks can be very difficult for institutional as well individual investors to stomach.


	That's why we focus on higher-quality companies that have very high-level, sustained revenue and earnings growth rates. They can dampen the volatility that's often associated with small cap growth, yet still see the benefits of having exposure to the small cap growth asset class through having a manager that focuses on conservative growth companies.




	AC:



	Conestoga's top 10 firm-wide holdings as of June 2010 are Carbo Ceramics, Advent Software, Advisory Board, CoStar Group, Blackboard, Bottomline Technologies, NVE, Quality Systems, Hittite Microwave, and Sun Hydraulics.



	Certainly since we started the firm in 2001, it was much more volatile than I think any of us [could have] imagined. So living through '01, the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the difficult '02; and then fast forward to the credit crisis and the Great Recession of 2009; what I think is critical, and gave [our firm and investment style] the ability to prosper, is really the confidence in knowing the companies that you own.


	We focus on companies that have strong management teams and having the confidence in those individuals. Understanding their philosophies and their approach about how they want to build their business. How they would react in very difficult and challenging economic times. Having companies that had significant[ly] very low leverage and very strong balance sheets really gave us the fortitude to continue to stay true to our discipline.



	Market myopia versus long-term investing



	So much of the market has been short-term oriented in terms of what have you done for me lately. That provides one of our competitive advantages [in that] we can look beyond the next quarter or two and use that to your advantage in order to build positions in companies, or increase positions in what otherwise might be viewed as a short-term disappointment from an earnings perspective.


	Perhaps the company spent more money than anticipated because of an opportunity. That is the right decision from a business perspective, but so many people who run investment management firms and mutual funds are looking for a short-term return that makes it very difficult for people to look beyond the next 90 days. I don't think [that] is good for American business in general.



	Hunting for the next multibagger stock



	We're very much fundamentally based. The investment team here spends a significant amount of time out on the road talking to companies [and] getting to know them: The management teams, competitors, suppliers. We do a lot of phone work as well, to try to ascertain whether or not what is presented to us in a conference room is in fact what's going on in the real world.


	We place a great deal of emphasis on going to industry trade shows [and] conferences. Putting some mileage on our cars. We're enrolled in several frequent flyer programs and we benefit from that.


	We have four criteria that we use that  we think define high-quality, small-cap names, and that whittles thousands of companies down to a universe of about 350 to 400 names. About a third of the portfolios historically come from that universe, from the screening process, and the remaining two-thirds come from more qualitative factors.




	AC:



	The four criteria are:




	1.




	The ability to generate annualized earnings growth of at least 15% for next three years




	2.




	A strong market position and high returns on equity (15% or more)




	3.




	A strong balance sheet and conservative accounting policies. Debt to equity ratio should be less than 40%.




	4.




	Good management team, typically with ownership of more than 10%.



	We've gotten to know a lot of the management teams that we invest in. And during our due diligence process, we often come across a better name than what we started with.


	That's how I found Neogen [see small-cap idea No. 2 below]. I was out visiting Meridian Bioscience and asked the CEO what other companies he thought were well-run in his space, or what they owned in their personal accounts. And he told me about this little company called Neogen, which I had never heard of. Wrote it down. Went back to the office and did work, and then went out to East Lansing and visited them.


	So it's a combination of factors. We try to be rigid yet flexible, if that makes sense. We don't want to just put blinders on and say, hey, if you don't have management ownership of 10%, you're automatically disqualified. If it's less than that because of some historical factors, we're willing to look at that, but we want to make sure that generally speaking, those companies meet our criteria.



	Healthy balance between business analysis and valuation



	We first and foremost look for a great business, but we also are valuation-sensitive. We want to make sure that we're paying what we think is a reasonable price for a business.


	We look at each company on a case-by-case basis. There are some companies that deserve to trade at a 10 to 15 multiple because of their business model and their cyclicality. We're willing to pay 20 times that for others because of their business model, the recurring revenue, and their strong competitive position.


	So we don't have a cookie-cutter valuation that says if it's X multiple, it's too expensive or too cheap. We think it's really important to look at each company on a case-by-case basis. The stock has got to be able to have the ability to double over a three- to five-year period of time in order to be included in our portfolio.




	AC:



	That's annualized returns of 15% to 25% over that three- to five-year period.




	Small-cap idea No. 1: Paying up for a franchise -- Carbo Ceramics



	One of our longest-term investments, and frankly [one of our] most successful investments, is a company called

	Carbo Ceramics

	(


	NYSE: CRR


	), which is based in Houston, Texas. It makes ceramic proppants that get dropped into oil and gas wells.


	The competitive product to that is a sander or sand resin. [With] a ceramic proppant, because of the uniform nature of that proppant, you can get more oil and gas out of a well. As a result, this company has demonstrated a long-term track record of being able to grow nicely in up markets, but also have the ability to take share in down markets.


	As a result, if you look at that stock on a valuation basis, relative to almost any other oil service company, when we bought it -- and the statement is true today -- it's relatively much more expensive than anybody else, but what you typically don't see, particularly in oil-service companies, is a proprietary advantage.


	So if you talk to a lot of industry-specific people about Carbo Ceramics, they would say, oh, that stock is way too expensive. We're structured here as generalists, so we're looking for good businesses, regardless of what industry [or economic sector] they serve. I think that benefits us because we don't have [these] very industry-focused valuation metrics.


	As a result, Carbo Ceramics has demonstrated over the past five [to] 10 years [the ability to] significantly grow their business in good times and in bad times. It shows up in their superior operating margins [and] their very strong return on equity.


	They're actually one of the few firms in the United States, if not the world, that's physically out of manufacturing capacity. They're in the midst of an expansion that they can't get up fast enough. That expansion will give them an additional 250 million pounds of ceramic proppant.



	Kicking the tires and checking underneath the hood



	With any name, including Carbo Ceramics, it usually takes us three to six to nine months to do our due diligence. [This] involves talking to competitors, suppliers, distributors, depending upon the particular business model and how they reach the market.


	We place a great deal of emphasis [on] getting to know those different data points and looking at industry conditions. In an oil-service company where energy, oil, and commodity prices are critical, it's important to make sure that your company has a significant proprietary advantage, because their end customers are so influenced by commodity prices.


	Energy has historically been a tough space for us because of that boom-bust mentality. We saw Carbo Ceramics' patent portfolio and how that has been a very strong note -- [which] a lot of people like to talk about these days -- in terms of being able to have an intellectual property surrounding that proppant.


	They also have locked up a raw material called kaolin that is a critical ingredient of ceramic proppants. They've been able to buy up a lot of that land in the United States, particularly in Georgia. The cost of moving that can be prohibitively expensive, so by locking up some of the resources, and putting their plants right next to them, they're effectively widening their moat.


	Those [are the] types of things we look for in order to be willing to pay what [perhaps] other people might consider a high multiple, [yet] what we think is a reasonable multiple given their competitive edge and their significant growth prospects.



	Portfolio approach: Diversify and manage by conviction



	We're very much managers of conviction. You can see that we have typically 45 names in the portfolio. Our top 10 names account for typically between 30% and 35% of the portfolio. With that said, we certainly want to make sure [we are] protecting the downside, and one of the ways to mitigate risk is by having diversification.


	And so we have 45 names that are spread across multiple economic sectors. We tend to not have certain industries or sectors represented because they don't have growth characteristics, like utilities or consumer staples.


	We have significant exposure into technology and health care and to the producer durable area. Very developed technology. Names like Blackboard and Blackbaud and Tyler, which are software related and are the respective 800-pound gorillas in their spaces. Their contracts are usually three to five years. They have renewal rates in excess of 90%, or so, and have very strong competitive positions.


	So it's critical that you're able to protect the downside and be able to have diversification across a number of sectors but still be willing, I think, to have conviction on the names that you own.


	We target no sector to be more than 25% of the overall portfolio. We're actually currently a little bit above that threshold, now, because some of our tech names have performed relatively well. We want to make sure that no sector weighting is two times more than the benchmark [Russell 2000].



	Small-cap idea No. 2: Neogen



	One of the themes we like [where] we tend to find a lot of companies is in the diagnostic states, and

	Neogen

	(


	Nasdaq: NEOG


	) is a company that really fits that bill extremely well. It is a food and animal safety diagnostic company based in East Lansing, Michigan.


	Michigan is [obviously] more known for its automobile exposure [than its health-care companies], but within East Lansing there is this company called Neogen. [And] interestingly, [Neogen] is the second largest owner of schools in East Lansing.


	Given the demographic shifts that have occurred, the East Lansing School District has looked to raise some funds. Neogen [has] found that it is a fantastic and very capital-efficient way to expand their facilities. In fact [there's a house] [next to] their headquarters, and the guy won't move because Neogen pays [his] taxes, cuts [his] lawn and doesn't have late-night parties.


	These guys run a great business, food and animal safety. It's obviously been in the news a lot [with] the recent salmonella outbreak within the egg business. And Neogen -- not that this will drive their revenue -- but it gets a lot of headlines because of its exposure to what has been a very hot topic in the news over the last several years with the recent food outbreaks like we've seen recently here with the egg and the poultry industries.


	Neogen has the broadest line of diagnostic products. As they say, from inside the farm gate to the table, they have a continuum of products that will serve the farmers, the food processors, and then the retailers as well.


	It's a company that's run by Jim Herbert and Lon Bonhannon. Jim Herbert was one of the founders and Lon, I think, has been there about 14 or 15 years. They're a great management team that's flown under the radar screen here for a couple of years. I think it's starting to get some notoriety in terms of being extremely well-positioned.


	Tractor Supply is a big customer of theirs, and they have a very long-term and very strong relationship with that entity.



	Thinking about acquisitions and returns on equity



	We look at returns on equity and returns on invested capital very critically. And if you looked at our return on equity, it's about 18% or 19%. Our return on invested capital is about 14% or 15%. So together they tell the same story, and I think our ROE number is fairly clean because of the types of companies that we invest in.


	Now Neogen is a bit of a different story. Half of its growth comes from internal, organic growth and new product development, and the other half comes from these acquisitions.


	We've been a shareholder for about three or four years. We tend to shy away from companies where acquisitions are part of the core strategy, but as we watched the company for a period of time, we got more comfortable that these acquisitions that they're doing are not transformational acquisitions. They tend to be very much extensions of their product line.


	Usually buying that product is kind of an orphan product line from the large multinational where $10 million doesn't mean anything, and then they acquire that product line. They have the capacity back in East Lansing to bring that manufacturing back to them and get scale on it, and then get it through their distribution channel. Actually, every one of their acquisitions that they've made has been accretive to its shareholders.


	And it's one of the more interesting conference calls. Jim Herbert, who is a Tennessean, has quite a number of good sayings during the call. I don't know if you know Simpson Manufacturing (


	NYSE: SSD


	), but Barclay Simpson and Jim Herbert, I think, are one of a kind that you typically don't see anymore.




	AC:



	Simpson Manufacturing is a former HG company that we sold near the top in late 2008 because the valuation outstripped our expectations. And yes, we loved listening into their conference calls to hear what Barclay had to say next.




	Small-cap idea No. 3: From the

	HG

	Watch List -- Abaxis




	Abaxis

	(


	Nasdaq: ABAX


	) is a diagnostic company based in Union City, Cali. Clint Severson is, I think, a fantastic manager. [He] has done a great job in terms of building a business, and more recently surrounding himself with other very strong managers like Don Wood, [who] I think [is] the chief operating officer and really effectively the head of the manufacturing operations.


	Up until Don came in, I would say people criticized Abaxis for their lack of manufacturing expertise. Don has come in and really put a very strong discipline in that; [has] been able to lower the cost of the discs, [and] we expect further cost reductions going forward.


	Abaxis has built up its own sales force within the veterinary area. I think a lot of investors focus on the medical side of the equation and the success, or lack thereof, that they have in that area as really a growth driver. I think they're going to be successful in both of those areas, in the veterinary area and in the medical area with their Piccolo.


	Basically it's a battle of a better product versus a distribution force, and who's going to win that. I think that given the country's and the world's focus on higher quality outcomes in an efficient fashion, Abaxis's product is extremely well-positioned.


	They don't have the huge distribution force that some of their competitors have, but they do have superior products in terms of their functionality, their features, and they make the physician office and the vet office much more efficient if you look at things from a total cost perspective.


	Abaxis is a name that hasn't really done much over the last several years, but, because of some of the changes they've undergone in terms of their distribution, I think it's extremely well-positioned, looking out the next three to five years to see continued traction in the medical space, and to drive their revenue and earnings in excess of 15% for the next several years.




	AC:

	Small-cap idea No. 4: Advisory Board




	Advisory Board

	(


	Nasdaq: ABCO


	) is a name that we've owned also for a considerable period of time, a company that I would say is a very dominant player in its space. [It is] well managed by Bob Musselwhite and Michael Kirshbaum. I think they're strong managers.


	They provide, I think, a very cost-effective solution to primarily hospitals within the United States. They ran into some difficulty, relatively speaking, in '08 and '09 as their customers were feeling the impact of the credit crunch, but they really showed the value of their products to their customer base during those difficult times and emerged a very strong player.


	They've had some difficulty implementing these web-based analytical tools to their customers, but I think they're on the back side of that implementation and those difficulties. That's shown up in terms of the growth in their contract value and in the renewal rate. So we think it's extremely well-positioned. It's got a great deal of cash in the balance sheet.


	The one fly in the ointment, there, is that the options that the management team pays themselves has a little more stock option overhang than what we typically like to see; but that's somewhat the nature of the beast in terms of how a generically speaking consulting firm still has to compete in terms of [what they] provide their employees, which are truly the assets of the business. They have to pay them well, and that's reflected, I think, in that option issue that surrounds the company.

                  10-Year
                398The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
