JDG Vinings 1 LLC, a entity controlled by Jefferson Development Group chairman and CEO Kevin Cogan, has acquired a 1.4 acre parcel of land on Hurstbourne Parkway in the former Williamsburg Plaza Office Park.
The property, which is on land in a proposed mixed-use development called The Vinings, was purchased from JHS Vinings LLC, an entity controlled by Papa John’s International Inc. (NASDAQ: PZZA) founder John Schnatter, according to a deed filed with the Jefferson County Clerk’s office. The value of the transaction was $1.03 million.

Officials with Evergreen Real Estate, another Schnatter holding that represents his personal real estate interests, could not immediately be reached for comment.





The property acquired by JDG is located along South Hurstbourne Parkway, between the Williamsburg Plaza and Wessex Place roads.
Brian Evans, vice president of planning and development for Jefferson Development, said the land was acquired by JDG Vinings as a site for a planned Panera Bread restaurant.
As Business First has reported, Panera Bread is one of two restaurants planned for The Vinings. Panera Bread plans to move a nearby restaurant to the location. Minneapolis-based Granite City Food & Brewery Ltd. also has announced plans to build a 10,511-square-foot restaurant at a nearby site in The Vinings, but no work has begun.




 


Evans said work on the Panera Bread restaurant is expected to start in March, pending development approval by the city of Hurstbourne. Work should take about five months, he said. “It’s been a long time coming,” Evans said. “It’s good to have some activity.”
As Business First has reported, Cogan and Schnatter formerly were partners in The Vinings project. Plans for a commercial development at the former Williamsburg Plaza date to 2007, when a partnership called The Vinings of Hurstbourne LLC I bought seven parcels at and near the business park for $12.6 million.
