              The table elastically deforms and stabilizes when force is applied. Watch it at 
              https://vimeo.com/51625557

 The Float table is a matrix of "magnetized" wooden cubes that levitate with respect to one another. The repelling cubes are held in equilibrium by a system of tensile steel cables. 
 It's classical physics applied to modern design. Each handcrafted table is precisely tuned to seem rigid and stable, yet a touch reveals the secret to Float's dynamic character. 




 
 




 
Even more counterintuitive than its predecessor, the Float shelf levitates out from the wall to give lofty purchase to your worthiest objects.

 The front cubes of the shelf repel out from wall; the back cubes affix rigidly to provide stability. Create your own configuration, length, or wall sculpture.

A brilliant cut diamond-shaped table balancing on its point.



 In contrast to a standard table, Brag is all face no legs. With a little extra commitment, we'll hide the base in your floor...so no one can run off with Your Precious.

            Jessica Banks CEO & Founder   


 Described as a creative hybrid, Jessica Banks invents products that transform how people think about the future of decor.
Inspired by physics principles, Jessica's creations expand the functional and aesthetic versatility of homes and workplaces.  
              

 A trained roboticist, Jessica holds an Engineer's and a Master's degree from MIT, where she was in the Humanoid Robotics Group within the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. She left graduate school just shy of her Ph.D. (in the 24th grade!) to teach about distributed power systems in MIT's Civil and Environmental Engineering Dept. Jessica also holds a B.S. in General Physics from the University of Michigan, with a concentration in creative writing- a combination which actually makes more sense on a quantum level. 
 Jessica's multi-disciplinary background has established her as a strategic and technical resource. This work includes projects such as campaign consultation for large ad agencies, development of global initiatives, viable products, and market strategies for international corporations, and design of robotic projects for Frank Gehry and Michel Gondry. She also used to be Al Franken's personal assistant.
Banks speaks at numerous conferences on topics ranging from science to manufacturing and her work has been featured in over 100 media outlets. She lives in Brooklyn and has superhuman peripheral vision.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

This Brooklyn Company Just Introduced a Way Cool Folding Chair (Yes, That's Possible)


RockPaperRobot is blowing through the Kickstarter campaign for its Ollie chair.

Jessica Banks designs magic tricks. The thing is, Banks's magic tricks are disguised as furniture.
She's the founder of RockPaperRobot, a robotics furniture maker in Brooklyn. Her newest offering, the Ollie chair, is her company's first attempt to appeal to a mass-market audience and to make her sleight of hand more accessible to the not-ultra-rich -- without breaking the bank herself. To fund, manufacture, and sell the chairs, RockPaperRobot turned to Kickstarter. The campaign has raised $220,000 so far, well beyond its initial goal of $80,000, and will end on March 29 at 9 a.m. ET.
Along the way, she says, she's had quite an education in crowdfunding. "It takes so much time and thought to do a Kickstarter," she says. "You have to get your ducks in a row way beforehand." For Banks, it's been one more step in a creative entrepreneurial journey. She studied at Rodney Brooks's robotics lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then stayed on to teach in the engineering department. She has also worked as a personal assistant to comedian and now-Senator Al Franken.
Her company's best-known product, the Float table, is composed of a few dozen cubes that seem to levitate, remaining perfectly spaced from each other even as they hover in the air. It costs about $10,000. Then there's the Brag table, a large Corian "diamond" that balances on a teeny point, and costs slightly less. But the Ollie chair, which neatly collapses with the pull of a string, is available on Kickstarter for a $300 contribution.
Before the Ollie chair came a folding table -- or at least that was the idea. Banks had been working for a few years on a table designed to simply glide off a wall, where it could be hung flat for storage. But when she showed a friend a prototype of the table, she got some unexpected feedback: What about the chairs?
Banks's response: "Oh, sh--. That is a f---ing great question." Fortunately, designing the chair turned out to be easier than designing the table (fewer moving parts, for one thing). Her company came up with a 16-pound indoor/outdoor chair, made of aluminum and teak. The teak slats can be customized with artwork, and the chair can be displayed just as a piece of flat art would be. A pull of a string collapses the chair into a rectangle just 2 1/4 inches thick.
Her reasons to launch the chair on a Kickstarter went way beyond cash. (RockPaperRobot raised a million-dollar seed round in 2014 and is now looking to do another.) Banks says that, in the long run, her goal is to sell the Ollie chair mostly to businesses -- hotels, cruise ships, restaurants. That's easier on the supply chain, because manufacturers have minimum order quantities, and businesses are more likely than individuals to buy lots of chairs at once. On Kickstarter, RockPaperRobot gets to sell to individuals, but the orders come in all at once, making it more similar to a corporate sale. "This really helps us finalize the tooling and refinement, and pay for the first chunk of chairs," says Banks.
Kickstarter could also provide a proof of concept for a marketing campaign. At the end of the Kickstarter, Banks will know how many people RockPaperRobot targeted, not just from its own mailing lists, but via bloggers who cover tiny houses, boating, and other venues where a cool folding chair might be popular. Then she will be able to see how many visited the Kickstarter site, and how many eventually bought a chair. "You really have to look at Kickstarter as marketing," she says. "We wanted to price it so it was attractive, so our margins are super low. We're paying for a lot of the shipping. We want people to know about the chair."
Banks opened up the Kickstarter for Ollie a day before she started publicizing it. She came up with a special early-bird deal for those who bought that first day. That way, when she started publicizing the Kickstarter, the Ollie chair was already selling. "When we said, 'Welcome aboard,' it looked like there were already people at the party," she said. "The psychology of it really makes a difference."
Similarly, the $80,000 figure was "part psychology and part realism," she says. If the Kickstarter brought in only $80,000, it would have been hard, but doable, to fulfill the order. RockPaperRobot would still have to put in about $40,000 or $50,000 for tooling, but Banks figured that would have been an acceptable cost to launch the product. At $200,000, she's able to cover a lot more of the cost of a minimum order, which is 864 chairs.
Banks's Kickstarter video shows the Ollie chair being used all over New York. She brought the chair to Times Square, figuring that the person who poses for photos dressed as the Statue of Liberty is on his feet all day. Why not get him (yes, it's a guy) to sit down for the video? But the actor dressed as the Statue of Liberty, it turns out, is on stilts, and they couldn't get a clean shot of him moving onto the chair, because removing the stilts is a bit complicated. This being Times Square, though, another character -- the Naked Cowboy -- was soon in the video. "We didn't mean to get him in the video," Banks says. His presence irritated a commenter on Kickstarter who didn't like that the Naked Cowboy is a supporter of President Trump. (Banks had no idea.) Her response: "RPR [RockPaperRobot] does not support Trump, but our chairs support everyone."

The Smart Home Goes Gorgeous--and Fun


Jessica Banks--engineer, designer, and founder of RockPaperRobot--has a vision for a smart home both beautiful and technologically advanced.

Plenty of entrepreneurs talk about disrupting an industry. Jessica Banks, founder of RockPaperRobot, is going to disrupt your furniture.
Don't laugh. Banks, a polymath who double-majored in physics and creative writing, sees infinite possibilities in something as seemingly simple as a table. Now she's using her engineering background--and a round of seed funding--to make them a reality.
The piece of furniture that put her New York City-based company on the map is essentially a space-age coffee table. Called the float table, it's a series of wooden cubes suspended in a grid formation. Each cube can be gently pushed out of place before snapping back, thanks to the powerful magnets embedded in each cube.
A 'float table' at the studio of RockPaperRobot. It was the company's first product and costs $10,000.
That table represents a landmark in Banks's fascinating journey from would-be astronaut to comedy talent scout to robotics engineer. (Her childhood reaction to being told she was a quarter-inch too short to become a space traveler: "That's fair, because at some point, you've got to pedal the [space] shuttle.")
But that same $10,000 table has also put her at a crossroads, for building bespoke robotic furniture and running a mass-market business. Now Banks is hoping her carefully engineered, beautifully designed furniture can reinvent how her customers think of the smart home.
"Physical objects give us a great deal of joy," she says. "Yet so much is built so that the human can ignore it." In her work, she says, she's looking to create "a favorable intrusion. Beauty is a welcome intrusion. Awe is a welcome intrusion." 
The Rebirth of Wonder
Banks didn't grow up tinkering and building, despite growing up close to tools. Her father, who had been a manager of industrial design for GE Medical, had a tempting workshop in the family's basement, but "my dad told me not to go into the side of the basement with the tools, so I wouldn't get hurt," Banks recalls. Sometimes she couldn't resist, playing with her dad's electric eraser and then denying any connection to the little latex threads left around the house.
During high school, she lost her vision for two terrifying weeks. (She still doesn't know why.) When it came back, her vision was far better than 20/20. "The tissue scarred in a way that I almost got natural Lasik," Banks says.
But her peripheral vision was also unusually sharp, and she'd lost the ability to filter out irrelevant visual input. Banks still makes what she calls visual mistakes, such as seeing separate objects overlap or blur together. "I'll see something and think, 'That thing is falling into that other thing,'" she says. "Then I realize, no, it's not--but it could. I could make that happen."
Those visual mistakes feed her creativity now. But in high school, Banks's altered vision pushed her to stick with math and physics, because it was so tiring for her to read big blocks of text. Math and physics books, with lots of white space surrounding the formulas, were easier to comprehend.
She went on to study physics in college, with the intention of becoming an astronaut. That meant joining the military, and Banks's liaison officer was skeptical. "I was asking questions like, well, what if I don't like this?" she recalls. "What if you tell me to shoot and I don't want to do it?"
Instead, she got a job at Comedy Central, worked briefly as a talent scout, and then as the personal assistant to Al Franken. The documentary Fast, Cheap and Out of Control, which featured MIT roboticist Rodney Brooks, made her realize that robotics might marry her disparate interests. She applied to Brooks's lab and was accepted.
There, finally, Banks got the run of a workshop. She describes her time at MIT as "the rebirth of wonder … I was walking around and could see details in ways I just couldn't before. I started working with my hands again."
She learned to use machine tools in the lab there, making up for the experience she had missed out on as a child. Her background in physics helped everything fit into place.
"First, I was like, whoa, this is how things are made," she says. "I didn't even think about it before. Then I was like, OK, I get it, this is a system, just like physics is a system. This is a more granular look at the world."
Jessica Banks, founder of RockPaperRobot, consults with furniture maker Pete Schlebecker. Their T-shirts say "RockPaperRobot" on the front and "The Robot Always Wins" on the back.
Banks thrived at MIT, staying on to lecture in the engineering department. Then the architect Frank Gehry came to the university scouting for assistants. Banks took a leave of absence to work with him--and when it was over, she didn't want to come back. "I was in the 24th grade," she says, and no longer 100 percent committed to academia. It was time to leave.
Banks had also become fixated on a magic trick she'd seen, in which magnets fell very slowly through a tube. "How can I give people that same sense of amazement?" she thought.
It occurred to her that furniture, as something everyone uses and understands, would make an ideal vehicle. And she knew she wanted to use cubes, even though she says, "I very rarely think about aesthetics first." A fellowship at art and technology incubator Eyebeam helped her start thinking through the float table; by 2010, she had a prototype.
The engineering and construction challenges presented by that table were a little ridiculous. Most furniture is built first, and then polished or finished. But to construct the float table, the cubes had to be perfect before they were assembled. The table had to be designed so that it could be repaired, even though a good deal of the table's charm comes from the fact that it doesn't appear to have any "parts" at all.
The magnets on the bottom row of cubes have to support the whole table, but in the upper two rows, any magnets Banks added would also increase the cubes' weight, and therefore the difficulty in repelling any particular cube from its neighbors.
At a retail price of $10,000, Banks wanted the tables to be beautiful, which meant endless fiddling with the cubes' arrangement and the grain of the wood. Once a table is finished, the owner can't just pick it up and move it around a room, so Banks had to design an installation for the table. "As an engineer and artist, I never feel like something is done," Banks says. "That's sort of a bad business model."
Part of the reason it took so long to develop the float table is that for all her talents, Banks isn't a furniture maker. When a friend introduced her to Pete Schlebecker, a furniture maker and teacher with an MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, Banks knew he would be her first employee. "OK, I'm committed," she thought. "Whatever I earn is his money."
Banks demonstrates an idea for a new clock.
RockPaperRobot now includes four full-time employees and nine part-timers. Money still comes chiefly from investors rather than customers: She's sold about sixteen float tables, each of which is handmade in her studio and ships with its own cleaning tools. She also raised a million-dollar seed round from angels in the fall of 2014.
Nonetheless, one of her chief priorities is developing new pieces of furniture and home accessories that can sell for three or four figures rather than five each. The magnets, theoretically, could be used to levitate a range of smaller objects, from tissue boxes to vases.
Levitation for the Home
Banks's vision of the smart home has almost nothing to do with the popular conception of the phrase. "People talk so much about the Internet of things, and I'm like, sure, whatever, of course everything is going to be connected," she says.
Instead, Banks sees the smart home as not just technologically enabled, but also creative and fun. After the float table, she introduced the float shelf, which appears to hover next to a wall. She's working on a chandelier that contracts or expands as it senses people moving around a room. Her chandelier's current form has a basic six arms, each holding a light bulb. The next version will sport a more organic, 3-D printed form, and the entire mass will glow. As it moves, it will use light to draw on the ceiling.
A more problematic design is one for another unconventional table, which Banks jokes "has taken a lot of my fertile years away." She hopes to unveil it at the New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair in May, and won't share details about its design before then. Getting it made has been harder than she expected, and the consultant she hired to do the final prototyping and the design for manufacture ended up being over budget, late, and generally not up to the task. That forced Banks to do the work in-house.
"I'm exhausted," she says. "Mortally exhausted. But right now, I can do it this way. I'm learning to delegate, which maybe will help."
She apologized when I tripped over an errant flip-flop, explaining that she'd slept in the studio the night before. In the face of constant fatigue, she's greatly refined her decision-making strategy: "There are no decisions," she says. "Just act, and course-correct quickly."
Her "no decisions" mantra means she now prefers less information to more, not even bothering to look at weather forecasts--she just keeps an umbrella and a sweater at her workshop.
Banks hopes things will ease up a bit after the trade show. Longer-term, she isn't sure what form RockPaperRobot will take. She doesn't find the manufacturing side of the work terribly fulfilling, and can see RockPaperRobot as a design and engineering firm--but a disruptive one, of course. After all, Banks isn't interested in "just pretty curves," she says. Instead, her next goal: "Deengineering, maybe?"
