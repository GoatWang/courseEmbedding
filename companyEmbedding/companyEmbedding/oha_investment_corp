As a percentage of OHAI's recent stock price of $3.29, this dividend works out to approximately 1.82%, so look for shares of Oha Investment Corporation to trade 1.82% lower — all else being equal — when OHAI shares open for trading on 3/29/16.

                Play/Pause





There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Working with a Personal Financial Advisor
Whether you're new to investing or have been investing for years, you owe it to yourself to experience the difference of working with an Edward Jones financial advisor. Our firm is built to deliver personalized service, and we treat you with the respect you deserve. We've been doing it since 1922.
How we can help
We get it. Investing can be complicated. Ask all the questions you want, and we will answer them in plain English. Your financial advisor is your long-term financial partner. These are important goals and you need an advocate – someone who listens and really understands what's important to you. We believe that's the best way to develop a personalized financial strategy.

Are We Right for You?
Here are 5 qualities you can expect from an Edward Jones financial advisor.
View slideshow
Read more 

Are We Right for You?






Understands Me
I want to work with a financial advisor who really gets to know me and my family, our goals and what’s important to us.







Clearly Explains Investing
I’m looking for a financial advisor who will spend time educating me on investment topics and answering my questions.







Knows My Investment Style
I want someone who makes recommendations in my best interest and explains how they can help me make progress towards my goals.







Meets on My Schedule
Meeting with my financial advisor should be convenient. And I want choices – whether that means meeting in person or over the phone.







Stays in Touch
I want my financial advisor to contact me to reassure me that I’m on the right track or make suggestions if I’m not. Even if I’m not expecting it.







Edward Jones & You
If these sound like qualities you’re looking for in a financial advisor, Edward Jones might be right for you.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your  investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Save a little more today,

Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html
