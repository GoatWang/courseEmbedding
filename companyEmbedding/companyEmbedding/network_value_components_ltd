IT Asset Management
The IT Managed Lifecycle will tie the loose ends of your existing Asset Management Strategy into a cohesive solution; while adding the power of Real-Time Lifecycle Management and Global Infrastructure Marketplace visibility. We take the heavy lifting associated with IT Lifecycle Management off your shoulders and reduce your IT Planning workload by more than 60%.
The IT Managed Lifecycle is a concierge, closed loop solution providing you the efficiency and market visibility your business lacks today. Reduce IT Cost and Maximize Asset Management efficiency today through the power of Network-Value Analytics and the IT Managed Lifecycle Engine.

IT Asset Procurement
The global infrastructure marketplace has opened the door to a variety of alternatives for your company to procure IT Infrastructure Equipment. However, maintaining visibility into these alternatives requires effort and research to stay up to date. Let the IT Managed Lifecycle do your heavy lifting.
Plan your IT Procurement proactively, based on real-time Global Market analytics produced by the IT Managed Lifecycle Engine. Receive alerts and notifications of price deviations in the market and purchase based on real-time supply and demand factors that impact price and delivery daily. Reduce your manual research time by 90% by having access to price quotes from multiple vendors at the click of a button. Understand the entire global supply chain before making a decision about where and when to buy.

IT Asset Maintenance
The IT Managed Lifecycle solution revolutionizes an archaic, siloed, and OEM policy driven approach to maintenance of IT assets. Network-Value’s Holistic, Analytics based maintenance model was developed by network and supply chain experts. We examine the lifecycle of IT assets in near real-time, and determine which models fall into one of three categories.
We analyze your IT asset base to determine the coverage requirement for each asset. With this approach, your organization can achieve the maximum amount of savings, without added risk to the business and with no sacrifice to your current SLA for performance and capabilities.

IT Asset Disposition
Today’s IT Asset Disposition strategy is critical to the success of every Enterprise IT Shop. The business challenge is that the operation is completely detached from the other phases of the equipment lifecycle.
The IT Managed Lifecycle gives you the power to drive your IT Asset Disposition strategy proactively, during the planning phase of your technology transformation. Capture cost savings on the front end of your transformation, not months or years after the transformation takes place and after your assets have depreciated to zero. Based on real-time data analytics of the IT Managed Lifecycle Engine you will obtain current market value across every technology domain of your data center or IT environment.
