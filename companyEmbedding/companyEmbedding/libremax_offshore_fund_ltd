    Greg Lippmann’s LibreMax Capital is turning out to
    be one of the more successful recent hedge fund start-ups,
    having reached $2.3 billion in assets in just two years since
    its launch.

That’s no easy feat in an environment where
    startups still struggle to raise money. It helps that the New
    York City-based hedge fund firm, co-founded by chief investment
    officer Lippmann and president Fred Brettschneider, have
    produced strong performance. The credit-focused
    firm’s two main funds, LibreMax Partners L.P. and
    LibreMax Offshore Partners, Ltd. were up more than 16 percent
    through the third quarter of this year, including an 8 percent
    gain in the third quarter alone. And since their October 1,
    2010 inception, the funds are up more than 23 percent.
Lippman’s reputation as a subprime star
    undoubtedly helped as well, however. Lippmann and his team at
    Deutsche Bank are credited with creating the credit default
    swaps that enabled investors to bet against sub-prime mortgages
    in 2007, making nearly $2 billion for the German bank. He was
    reportedly upset with his $50 million bonus at the time.
LibreMax told clients in its third-quarter letter, dated
    November 19, that it benefited in the third quarter as pricing
    for securitized products gained strength and synthetic
    residential mortgage-backed securities outperformed most
    markets.
The firm pointed out that the broader markets have been
    rallying since June after the onset of the so-called Outright
    Monetary Transactions program by the European Central Bank
    — Europe’s desperate plan to save the
    Euro by buying sovereign debt — and the third round of
    quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.
As it looked out to the end of the year, LibreMax said it
    increased its exposure throughout the third quarter amid a
    broader market rally. However, it stressed in the letter that
    it positioned the portfolio conservatively because of several
    concerns, including the U.S. presidential election, the fiscal
    cliff, fears of a renewal of tension in the Eurozone, and the
    uncertain effects of Superstorm Sandy.
"We remain bullish on the relative prospects for securitized
    products," Lippmann wrote in the letter. "After multiple years
    of underperformance, we believe the outperformance of housing,
    compared to other economic data in 2012, heralds the beginning
    of a multi-year relative trend regardless of the strength of
    the U.S. economy."
He also said in the letter he sees potential strength in
    residential MBS as well as shorter-duration, non-mortgage
    backed bonds.
LibreMax is not alone. In a Bloomberg TV interview on
    Tuesday, Bruce Richards, co-founder of Marathon Asset
    Management, singled out structured credit, illiquid high yield
    assets such as aircraft lease obligations, and the subprime
    market as especially attractive for investment these days.
Lippmann and Brettschneider have spent most of their careers
    working at the same firms. Prior to launching LibreMax, they
    each spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank. Before that, both men
    started their careers at Credit Suisse.
Lippmann has spent his entire 22- year career on Wall Street
    trading asset-backed securities — mostly mortgages,
    both commercial and residential. At Deutsche Bank, Lippman was
    most recently head of all non-agency residential
    mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and
    collateralized debt obligation trading globally. Before that,
    he spent nine years at Credit Suisse.
Brettschneider was head of global markets for the Americas
    at Deutsche Bank, where he was responsible for managing the
    debt and equity businesses in the Americas and supervising a
    staff of over 2,000 people. He joined Deutsche Bank in 2000 as
    the head of ABS trading and syndicate. Prior to Deutsche Bank,
    Brettschneider was global head of ABS trading and the co-head
    of MBS trading at Credit Suisse.
