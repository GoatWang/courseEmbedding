Charter Fiberlink CCO, LLC, Charter Fiberlink CC VIII, LLC, Charter Advanced Services (WI), LLC and Charter Advanced Services VIII (WI), LLC currently offer the services that are the subject ofthis Application in parts ofthe State of Wisconsin.Brief description of the type of service affected The Charter Fiberlink Companies and Charter Advanced Services Companies propose to discontinue offering to new customers discounted interconnected VoiP services that are marketed to qualifying residential customers as Lifeline service in California, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin and as Telephone Assistance Plan service in Minnesota. These services provide local calling at a discounted rate. The Charter Fiberlink Companies currently have no customers for these services. The Charter Advanced Services Companies have no current plans to discontinue the services to their existing customers. The Charter Fiberlink Companies and Charter Advanced Services Companies provide voice communication services exclusively in the form ofinterconnected VoiP service. The Charter Fiberlink Companies are state-certificated competitive local exchange carriers that historically have offered the subject services as tariffed local exchange service pursuant to requirements ofstate laws in the states in which they operate. On March 1, 2013, the Charter Fiberlink Companies assigned the rights to serve their residential interconnected VoiP service customers to the Charter Advanced Services Companies in accordance with provisions in their3customer service agreements. Because of changes in state laws and related changes in their operations, the Charter Fiberlink Companies no longer are required to offer these discounted services to qualifying residential customers. The Charter Advanced Services Companies have never been required by state law to offer these or similar discounted services.The Charter Fiberlink Companies currently have no customers for the services. The Charter Advanced Services Companies have decided to discontinue offering these services to new customers only. None ofthe Charter Fiberlink Companies or the Charter Advanced Services Companies is an eligible telecommunications carrier or receives state or federal reimbursement for discounting the price ofthese services. Similar discounted services are available in the Service Areas from incumbent local exchange carriers and other eligible telecommunications carriers.Brief description of the dates and methods of notice to all affected customers The Charter Fiberlink Companies and Charter Advanced Services Companies have not provided any customer notices because there are no affected customers. The Charter Fiberlink Companies currently have no customers for the affected services, and the Charter Advanced Services Companies propose only to discontinue offering the affected services to new customers. The Charter Advanced Services Companies intend to continue providing the affected services to their existing customers at the same rates, terms and conditions at which they currently provide the services to those customers until individual customers voluntarily terminate their service or until service to individual customers is terminated for non-payment or violation ofthe terms ofservice. In the event that the Charter Advanced Services Companies in the future decide todiscontinue providing the affected services to their then-existing customers, they will provide the4then-existing customers with appropriate notice and submit a Section 63.71 application for authority to do so.Non-dominance of the carrier with respect to the service to be discontinued The services to be discontinued are interconnected VoiP services. Accordingly, the Charter Fiberlink Companies and the Charter Advanced Services Companies are non-dominant with respect to the services as a matter oflaw. Service In accordance with Section 63.71 of the Commission's rules, CC Fiberlink has mailed copies ofthis Application to the Governors of the States of California, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, the Tennessee Regulatory Authority, the Public Utility Commission ofTexas, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the United States Secretary ofDefense. Conclusion The public convenience and necessity will not be adversely affected by the discontinuance ofthe offering ofthese services because no existing customer will be affected and comparable services are available from other providers in the market. CC Fiberlink respectfully requests that the Commission approve the Section 63.71 Application of the Charter Fiberlink Companies and the Charter Advanced Services.Companies to discontinue offering discounted local interconnected VoiP service to existing customers marketed as Lifeline service in California, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin and as Telephone Assistance Plan service in Minnesota.
