I, Wynnefield Small Cap Value Offshore Fund, Ltd., Wynnefield Capital Management, LLC and Wynnefield Capital, Inc. jointly filed a Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership on Form 4 (the "Form 4") with respect to the issuer's common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), reflecting Shannon River Fund Management Co LLC's relationship as Portfolio Manager with respect to the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons.

I, Wynnefield Small Cap Value Offshore Fund, Ltd., Wynnefield Capital Management, LLC, and Wynnefield Capital, Inc.

                    The Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation (SWCRF) is a leading international organization dedicated to curing and preventing cancer. Founded in 1976, the SWCRF has raised more than $80 million to fund 200 researchers and their projects on three continents.          The SWCRF focuses on uncovering and correcting cancer- causing abnormal gene function. This approach allows us to deliver tailored, minimally toxic treatments to patients. The SWCRF Institute Without Walls allows our group of world-class scientists to share information and tools to speed the pace of cancer research. We believe that collaboration is the most critical means to bring treatments from science more rapidly.          Support for the SWCRF enables us to invest in innovative research that might not otherwise have received funding. This commitment has resulted in major breakthroughs – curing a form of acute leukemia to identifying potential novel therapeutics in all types of cancer.
