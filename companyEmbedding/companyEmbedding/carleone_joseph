Chairman, AMPAC Fine Chemicals LLC

Joe Carleone is the founder of Carleone Partners, an advisory firm to the Chemical and Aerospace industries.
Joe also currently serves as Chairman of AMPAC Fine Chemicals, a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital specializing in manufacturing custom active pharmaceutical ingredients.
From January 2010 to December 2015, Joe served as President and Chief Executive Officer of American Pacific Corporation (AMPAC), a diversified chemicals company, which has experienced significant transformation over these five years through both acquisitions and divestitures. Joe led the public-to-private transaction of AMPAC in 2014. Some specifics regarding AMPAC’s business are as follows:

In Rancho Cordova, CA, near Sacramento, AMPAC Fine Chemicals is a leading producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and registered intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry. These products include compounds used for anti-viral applications, including HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C and the drug Tamiflu. In addition, products are made for use in the treatment of cancer and central nervous systems disorders. The company operates the largest chiral separation facility in North America. The Fine Chemicals business also has a production facility in La Porte, TX.


In Cedar City, UT the company produces the solid propellant oxidizer, ammonium perchlorate, which is used in the space programs as well as a number of critical DOD programs. At that location, the company also produces other chemicals for commercial application and the clean fire-extinguishing chemical, Halotr

Prior to joining AMPAC, Joe Carleone was President of Aerojet Fine Chemicals LLC, where he led a growing GenCorp business, which developed, scaled-up and produced Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry. Joe led the sale of this company to American Pacific Corporation in 2005.
Before leading the Chemicals business, Joe was the Vice President for Operations and Remote Sensing at Aerojet, and earlier VP of Tactical and Defense rocket motor programs. As VP Operations, he led a 2,000-person organization at three major locations representing over $540 million in annual sales. As VP/GM of Remote Sensing, he led the Remote Sensing Systems product sector which delivered satellite sensors for surveillance, meteorological and earth-sensing systems.
Joe has also participated on a number of boards, both public and private. Joe is currently a Director of Sensient Technologies (NYSE: SXT). He served on the American Pacific Corporation (NASDAQ: APFC) Board from 2006 – 2014, where most recently he was the Chairman and CEO prior to merging APFC with H.I.G. Capital in a public-to-private transaction. From 2003 – 2006, Joe served on the Irvine Sensors (NASDAQ: IRSN) Board as an independent Director where he was a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees. He also served on the Board of Reinhold Industries from 2007 – 2010.
Joe holds a doctorate and a master’s degree in Applied Mechanics and a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University. He has continued his education at the California Institute of Technology and UCLA Anderson School of Business in the areas of business and management. He has published over 45 articles and a book entitled, Tactical Missile Warheads.

About the Book
+
-

   By marrying warhead fundamentals with more modern design approaches, this book will assist new members of the warhead community to learn more rapidly, as well as provide a reference text for those working actively in the field. The book's chapters are each self-contained articles; however, the topics are linked and may be divided into three groups. The first group provides a broad introduction, as well as four fundamental technology areas, namely, explosives, dynamic characterization of materials, explosive-metal interaction physics, and hydrocodes. The second group presents the mechanics of three major types of warheads, shaped charges, explosively formed projectiles, and fragmentation warheads. The interaction with various types of targets is also presented. The third group addresses test methodology. Flash radiography and high-speed photography are covered extensively, especially from an applications point of view. Special methods are also presented, including the use of tomographic reconstruction of flash radiographs and the use of laser interferometry.
