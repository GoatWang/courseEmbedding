Shares of Visa and E-Trade Financial are in buy zones ahead of their earnings.
Visa
Estimates: Fiscal Q3 EPS is seen climbing 16% to 80 cents, as revenue jumps 20% to $4.36 billion.
Results: EPS of 86 cents on revenue of $4.6 billion. Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, surged 38% to $1.9 trillion. Total Visa processed transactions jumped 44% to 28.5 billion, or 13% inclusive of Europe.
Outlook: Full-year revenue growth now seen at 20%, up from a prior view of 16%-18% growth, while Wall Street sees an increase of 18.5%.
Stock: Visa rallied 1.2% late. Shares closed down 0.1% at 98.11 on the stock market today. Visa cleared a 96.70 flat-base buy point last Friday, but the volume on the breakout and this week has not been impressive.
Transaction-services provider Alliance Data Systems (ADS) plunged 9.3% to 239 after its earnings report this morning. Alliance Data, which handles store credit cards for many merchants, had been flirting near a buy point.
Capital One
Estimates: An 8% earnings jump to $1.90 on an almost 7% revenue gain to $6.68 billion.
Results: EPS of $1.96 on revenue of $6.7 billion. Credit card revenue grew 6.8% to $4.17 billion. Consumer banking revenue rose 9.1% to $1.76 billion, and commercial banking revenue gained 9.3% to $752 million. The provision for credit losses decreased 10% to $1.8 billion. Net interest margin was flat at 6.88%.
Stock: Capital One jumped 4.9% late. Shares dipped 0.45% to finish at 81.01, testing support at the 50-day moving average.
E-Trade
Estimates: EPS to stay flat at 48 cents, as revenue jumps nearly 17% to $554 million.
Results: EPS of 52 cents on revenue of $577 million. Net new brokerage accounts grew at an annualized pace of 4.7% to 41,000. Net new brokerage assets rose at an annualized rate of 3.5% to $2.6 billion.
Stock: E-Trade rose 3.5% late. Shares slipped 0.2% to close at 39.60, but still above a 38.71 entry.
Discount broker TD Ameritrade (AMTD) reported earlier this week and beat on both the top and bottom lines, despite the industrywide slashing of stock and ETF trading fees. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab (SCHW) met profit views on Tuesday.
Skechers
Estimates: EPS to fall 8% to 44 cents despite a 10% revenue jump to $966 million.
Results: EPS of 38 cents on net sales of $1.03 billion. Domestic wholesale business sales increased 6.4%, international wholesale business sales surged 18.6%, and company-owned global retail business sales jumped 28%, including a 7.1% gain in  comparable-store sales.
Stock: Skechers fell 2.3% late. Shares ended 0.9% lower at 28.31.
"Given the increases in our international business, which for the first six months represented 48 percent of our total business, we believe the greatest opportunity for expansion is internationally, and we are investing in our infrastructure and marketing to support this progress," said COO and CFO David Weinberg in a statement.

These 2 Dow Stocks Are In Buy Zones Ahead Of Earnings 






BILL PETERS
7/17/2017


 Reprints




Dow Jones industrial average components American Express (AXP) and Visa (V) report quarterly earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
XAutoplay: On | OffMeanwhile, Capital One Financial (COF) and Alliance Data Systems (ADS) report on Thursday.
The results come as shares of those credit card giants and others in the payments space flirt with buy zones.
Here's a look at what to expect:
Visa
Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 81 cents, a 17% increase, on revenue of $4.361 billion, a 20% jump, according to Zacks Investment Research.
Stock: Visa cleared a 96.70 flat-base buy point on Friday, hitting a record high and closing at 96.93.
Shares edged down 0.1% to 96.83 Monday stock market trading. Rival Mastercard (MA), which reports second-quarter earnings on July 27, was holding above 126.29 buy point, dipping rising 0.3% to 127.42. Mastercard also broke out of a flat base on Friday.



Even though weak loan growth in a cautious business environment, a tamer forecast for net interest income, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's rant about "the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country" became the main take-aways from JPMorgan's second-quarter earnings on Friday, the bank's credit card sales volumes remained solid. That figure rose 15.3% for Q2, better than in Q1.
"We view JPMorgan's results as having positive implications for Visa, as JPM is Visa's largest issuer," Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan wrote in a research note on Friday.
And amid a fight between banks for the biggest spenders, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake on Friday also said the "extraordinary success" of the bank's Chase Sapphire Reserve card — which carries the Visa label and is jammed with perks intended to draw a  wealthier, younger consumer — has been a major accelerant in card revenue.
"I always feel compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers," she said. "Their characteristics, their engagement, their spend — these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have them and we intend to deepen relationships with them."
Visa also stands to benefit from being the sole credit card provider for Costco (COST), a relationship that came at American Express' expense. Its acquisition last year of Visa Europe, growing support of digital payments and its forays into nations where many people still pay largely in cash are also seen working in the company's favor.
But more exposure internationally means the company's revenues risk taking a hit from a stronger dollar. Rising client incentives also threaten revenue, Zacks said.
Visa and other card investors should pay attention to Bank of America (BAC) earnings Tuesday, for more insight into credit card trends.
American Express
Estimates: Second-quarter EPS is expected to plunge 43% to $1.47, with revenue dipping 1% to $8.154 billion.
Stock: Shares dipped 0.1% to 85.23 on Monday. The stock is still within range of an 82.10 buy point of a flat base cleared nearly a month ago.



American Express' breakup with Costco last year, along with a less-friendly foreign-exchange translation and higher provisions for losses are likely to weigh on revenue and margins this year, Zacks said.
"Costco used to be a major acquisition channel for American Express' U.S. consumer and small business areas," Zacks said. "Though the company replaced all the volume it used to derive through the Costco channel with other proprietary channels and other products, the adverse impact of the loss of the partnership should continue for next few quarters."
But like Visa, AmEx is also poised to grow as more people use electronic payments and as countries outside the U.S. adopt credit cards. The company has also tried to compete with the Chase Sapphire Reserve by adding its own sweeteners to its high-end Platinum Card.
Capital One, Alliance Data Systems
Meanwhile, Capital One is expected to report an 8% EPS gain to $1.90, with revenue up 6.5% to $6.67 billion. But Capital One has missed earnings estimates in four of the last five quarters, including the last two. Revenue has been below views in the last two quarters. The stock is trading between its 200-day and 50-day moving averages as it tries to build a new base. Capital One stock fell 0.4% Monday.
Alliance Data Systems, which manages private-label credit cards for retailers and other businesses, is slated to boost per-share profit by 6% to $3.47, with revenue up 5% to $1.837 billion. Shares fell 0.9% to 261.85 Monday. That stock peeked out past a 264.56 buy point from a cup-with-handle base on Thursday, then dipped back below that entry on Friday.

History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]

History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]

History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]

Alliance Data








































 













Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.







Our Businesses







Card Services
Epsilon
LoyaltyOne







At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.

Alliance Data








































 













Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.







Our Businesses







Card Services
Epsilon
LoyaltyOne







At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.02      Net Money Flow ($)  2.24 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Alliance Data








































 













Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.







Our Businesses







Card Services
Epsilon
LoyaltyOne







At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.

History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]
Company acquisitions and divestitures[edit]

Alliance Data








































 













Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.







Our Businesses







Card Services
Epsilon
LoyaltyOne







At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.

History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]

History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
