Remembering Dr. John A. Ronning




Dr. John Alfred Ronning
Dr. John Alfred Ronning, 90, of Burr Ridge, Illinois died on April 4, 2012, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.  He was devoted to his family.  Dr. John was a dedicated dentist, an avid golfer and a faithful churchman.
Dr. Ronning was born on April 21, 1921, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Magnus and Henrietta (nee Reinholtzen) Ronning.   The grandson of Norwegian immigrants, John attended Mozart School and North Park Academy in Chicago.  In the 1930’s John achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, a tradition continued by his son and three grandsons.
John attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, and in 1986 was recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus of his Alma Mater.  He pursued his dental training at Northwestern University School of Dentistry and upon graduation in 1944, he joined the faculty and taught in the Crown and Bridge department.
On March 14, 1945, John married Leila Ann Southard, the daughter of Ann Nelson Southard and Albert Edwin Southard.  Leila was a nursing student from Fargo, North Dakota.
During World War II, Dr. Ronning held the rank of Lieutenant J.G. in the U.S. Navy.   He served at Sampson Naval Base in Geneva, New York and Paris Island in Beaufort, South Carolina.   In 1952, Dr. Ronning was recalled into military service during the Korean Conflict and served at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
Dr. Ronning practiced dentistry in Chicago, Highland Park and Hinsdale, Illinois. While in private practice, he was on the staff of Hinsdale Adventist Hospital. He was a recipient of the Northwestern University Alumni Service Award, and in 1983, he was inducted as a Fellow in the Academy of the American College of Dentists.   Dr. Ronning also served as Past President of the West Suburban Branch of the Chicago Dental Society.  After 45 years of care for his patients, he retired in 1990.
Dr. John was recognized for his civic, philanthropic and professional leadership.  He served on the Planning Commission for the Village of Hinsdale.
Dr. Ronning was an active member of the Hinsdale Covenant Church.  He served as superintendent of the Sunday School and chairman of the church.   At Holy Spirit Lutheran Church in Juno Beach, Florida, Dr. Ronning served as an advisor for fund development as the church expanded and grew over its 25 years of ministry.
Dr. John was a member  of the Hinsdale Golf  Club and served as a member of the Board of Directors.  He was also a member of Old Marsh Golf Club in Florida.  He amazed his opponents with his “straight ball” and accurate putts, shooting his age well into his 80’s.
“Poppa” to his grandchildren, was a great cook.  His legendary “Poppa Pancakes” were always a special treat.  Poppa was also a great fisherman—many memories were made in the fishing boat on Rainy Lake, or playing games in the cabin on Island A-77.
Dr. Ronning is survived by his wife of 67 years, Leila Ann Southard Ronning:  his sister, Carol Ronning Hanson and her husband, Minnard “Dusty” of Burr Ridge, Illinois; his son, Dr. John David Ronning and his wife Kerry (nee Stewart) of Oak Brook, Illinois; his daughters, Dr. Diane (nee Ronning) Halbrook and her husband Dr. Steve Halbrook of Fayetteville, Arkansas; and Karen (nee Ronning) Lang and her husband Dr. Curtis Lang of Sycamore, Illinois; eight grand-children, 10 great-grandchildren, his cousins, nieces, nephews and extended family.
A Memorial Services will be held on Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 11:00 a.m. at Holy Spirit Lutheran Church in Juno Beach, Florida.  A reception will follow the service.
On Friday, April 27, 2012, a Memorial Service will be held at 11:00 a.m. at the Hinsdale Covenant Church, Fourth at Garfield Streets in Hinsdale, Illinois. Following the service, a reception will be held at the Hinsdale Golf Club.
The family has requested in lieu of flowers that memorials be sent to:
King-Bruwaert Retirement Community 6100 South County Line Road, Burr Ridge, IL 60527
Hinsdale Covenant Church Fourth and Garfield Street, Hinsdale, IL 60521
Holy Spirit Lutheran Church 13301 Ellison Wilson, Juno Beach, FL  33408

40 weeks and counting




   When one is nine months pregnant, one gets all sorts of
comments and advice from others. 
My pregnancy has been no exception.  For about the past month, I’ve had to put up with the
constant comments regarding my size. 
Lots of people have wondered if I’m carrying twins (for the record, I am
not) while others stare while I walk by – without even the decency to look away
when I catch their eye.  And there
are the people who just have no filter – like the seemingly nice woman at the
restaurant the other day that said “Oh my god, you are HUGE” before I could
even place my order (which was a big grilled cheese and a side of french
fries).
While the constant comments regarding my size has worn down
my ego and my patience, the part that still amuses me is the advice given to me
by complete strangers.  And perhaps
the most entertaining advice comes in the form of advice on how to induce
labor.  As such, I thought I should
share with others some of the more unique stories I have heard about how to
“get things moving”.
Here are some of my favorites:

·     
Drive over railroad tracks repeatedly;
·     
Sit on a birthing ball/exercise ball;
·     
Eat eggplant parmesan;
·     
Clean the house;
·     
Eat popcorn;
·     
Go for walks;
·     
Spicy food;
·     
Sex.

I’m wondering what some of you have heard or been told (or
even better, what has worked!). 
Please share in the comment section below.
