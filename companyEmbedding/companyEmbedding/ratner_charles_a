Gerald Irving Ratner (born 1 November 1949[3]) is a British businessman and motivational speaker. He was formerly chief executive of the major British jewellery company Ratners Group (now the Signet Group). He achieved notoriety after making a speech in which he jokingly denigrated two of the company's products, which caused the company's near collapse (the so-called "Ratner effect").

Early life and career[edit]
Gerald Ratner was born in London and based his philosophy of business on his experiences as a boy in Petticoat Lane Market. He observed that "the people who shouted the loudest and appeared to give the best offers sold the most."[4]
Ratner joined the family business in 1966 and built up an extremely successful chain of jewellers during the 1980s, of which he was chief executive. The shops shocked the formerly staid jewellery industry by displaying fluorescent orange posters advertising cut price bargains and by offering low price ranges. The Ratners Group consisted of Ratners, H. Samuel, Ernest Jones, Leslie Davis, Watches of Switzerland and over 1000 shops in the US including Kays. Ratners was one of the few British retailers to succeed in the US.[citation needed]
The speech[edit]
Although widely regarded as "tacky",[5] the shops and their wares were nevertheless extremely popular with the public, until Ratner made a speech addressing a conference of the Institute of Directors at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 April 1991.[6] During the speech, he commented:


“
We also do cut-glass sherry decanters complete with six glasses on a silver-plated tray that your butler can serve you drinks on, all for £4.95. People say, "How can you sell this for such a low price?", I say, "because it's total crap."[7]
”


He compounded this by going on to remark that one of the earrings were "cheaper than an M&S prawn sandwich but probably wouldn't last as long." Ratner's comments have become textbook examples of why chief executives should choose their words carefully. In the furore that ensued, customers exacted their revenge by staying away from Ratner shops. After the speech, the value of the Ratner group plummeted by around £500 million, which very nearly resulted in the firm's collapse.[8] Ratner hired a chairman in an attempt to stabilise the situation, but was subsequently fired by the new company leader in November 1992. The group then changed its name to Signet Group in September 1993.[1]
Today, Ratner's speech is still famous in the corporate world as an example of the value of branding and image over quality. Such gaffes are now sometimes called "doing a Ratner",[9] and Ratner himself has acquired the sobriquet "The Sultan of Bling".[10] Ratner has said in his defence that his remarks were not meant to be taken seriously. He also largely blamed the aggressiveness and deliberately wrongful interpretation of several media outlets for the severe consumer reaction.[1]
After Ratners[edit]
Following an unsuccessful attempt to become a jewellery consultant in France during the mid-1990s, he set up a health club in Henley-on-Thames in 1996, which was sold for £3.9m in 2001. Ratner now runs, in collaboration with SB&T International Ltd, an export manufacturing company based in India and the online jewellery business Gerald Online.[11] In 2013, during a visit to India for the inaugural eTailing India Expo, Gerald Ratner announced that he would be entering the Indian market.[12]

These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. H Charles Harris1190 NW 95th St Ste 101Miami, FL 33150(305) 691-2941Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Baumberger Charles H44 W Flagler St Ste 1675Miami, FL 33130(305) 373-0708AttorneysMalpractice Law AttorneysServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Gelman, Charles H Pa25 SE 2nd AveMiami, FL 33131(305) 579-9100AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Johnson Charles H201 S Biscayne BlvdMiami, FL 33131(305) 373-4000AttorneysLegal Service PlansAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Johnson, Charles H396 Alhambra CirCoral Gables, FL 33134(305) 373-4000AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Groves, Charles H Esq1175 NE 125th StNorth Miami, FL 33161(305) 892-2990AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Charles H Groves Law Offices1175 NE 125th StNorth Miami, FL 33161(305) 892-2887AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Charles H Moses III DDS1221 W Broward BlvdFort Lauderdale, FL 33312(954) 462-9606DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Lichtman Charles H350 E Las Olas BlvdFort Lauderdale, FL 33301(954) 525-9900AttorneysCriminal Law AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Charles H Rubenstein Attorney412 SE 23rd StFort Lauderdale, FL 33316(954) 760-4400AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Richard, Charles H, MD1528 NE 4th AveFort Lauderdale, FL 33304(954) 467-8855Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Moses III, Charles H, DDS1221 E Broward BlvdFort Lauderdale, FL 33301(954) 462-9606DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryBusinesses in related categories to Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED13. Hair Transplant Institute Of Miami4425 Ponce De Leon BlvdCoral Gables, FL 33146(786) 646-6860Hair ReplacementPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: The Hair Transplant Institute of Miami specializes in hair transplant surgery for men and women.
