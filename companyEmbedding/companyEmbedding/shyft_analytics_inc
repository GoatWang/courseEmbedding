Learning
Our Core Values guide both the work and play that happens at SHYFT—and this includes our approach to learning and development.  What it boils down to is that we believe learning happens in all directions—up, down and sideways!




Close





Bring your ‘A’ Game
We hire smart people with an aptitude for learning and provide the space (and tools!) to grow and be successful at SHYFT. We expect that everyone bring their ‘A’ game and participate in the programs that we have available, with the vision that we all are taking the lead on continually growing our capabilities.
Deliver Amazing Client Experiences
Continuing to strive toward mastery in everything we do leads to successful client relationships. We also believe there is more to the job itself – we invest in the whole person and develop our people with that in mind.
Everyone is an Innovator
We look for everyone to be a leader and innovator, despite roles or titles, and we develop all levels using a variety of learning tools. We recognize that innovative companies are going to hit road bumps and we embrace the learning components that arise.
Have Fun & Embrace the Team
Participation is at our core, starting with our team approach to ramping up new hires. Have an exciting hobby or project based nugget to share? We have the venue for you! We value authenticity (the quirkier the better!) and connectedness to our mission, values and ultimately the ever-growing SHYFT team!













SHYFT Up!










Balance
We are a client-driven company who goes above and beyond to exceed expectations. But we also raise families, renovate homes, make time for our friends, compete (biking, boating, and triathlons), and coach soccer. We know how important it is to take time to do the things we enjoy.








A Great Place to Work

Young culture with lots of raw energy. The opportunity for growth and learning is mediocre, but it is up to the individual to seek it out (some of this is being absorbed as the company moves towards productizing). Products are awesome and have enormous potential to make an impact in the market, but remain untested. Pay is okay. Benes are great.ConsThe company is going through a ‘transformation phase’, which means that talent is leaving and the company is grasping at straws to keep people as business objectives proceed. The company is not operating efficiently and there is very little collective experience (the exception being higher ups). Young culture translates to lots of fooling around. Transparency is okay. The need to know info is shared, but rumor mills run strong. I am not sure that the current business model and market potential warrants added growth.Advice to ManagementMitigate gossip and poor attitudes. Stimulate and challenge the minds of your employees and provide them with the opportunity to learn. Right the customer side of the company and get those awesome products into the hands of customers!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) SHYFT Analytics Response Jul 11, 2017 – CEO Thanks for your comments and feedback – I really appreciate you taking the time to write. I couldn’t agree more with what you like about SHYFT – we do have the best people and the best products. Youour unique culture and great benefits, learning and fun are all part of the recipe along with our Core Values. You’re correct that our staff turn-over is slightly higher than in years past. There are two main reasons (1) we’re a high-performance culture and not everyone makes the grade and (2) the pace we’re setting with our growth is not for everyone. That said, our turn-over is below industry average and we try and strike the right work-life balance. And we attract the best people because we’re working on hard problems that improve patients lives with a smart and diverse team with a focus on culture.​ I agree that learning is important and the reason we have almost 100 internal and online learning modules on our newly implemented training platform. If you include our Lunch and Learn series, our Woman in Tech Program, and our Management Series, I’d hope you’d agree that learning is a key ingredient to our culture. And yes, we do invest in recent grads from great programs but our average age is still over 33. We can agree to disagree on transparency. We work hard to share company information with our entire team at our monthly all-hands meetings including the popular “Ask Us Anything” session where we field 10-20 of your direct questions. Communication and transparency are core to our culture and why we’re a Glassdoor OpenCompany which recognizes and reward companies that embrace transparency in the workplace. Thanks again for your feedback and I wish you a successful and rewarding time at SHYFT! -Zack... MoreLess SHYFT Analytics 2017-06-30 16:49 PDT Apr 14, 2017 Helpful (1)"A great foot in the door"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at SHYFT Analytics full-time (More than a year)ProsHealth benefits are good and inexpensiveStaff is hard working and most genuinely care about the product and future of the companyFun environmentConsLocation - the building is very nice but the area itself is not. Nothing much to do, would be better closer to Boston.Management - many members of the management team have little to no experience managing people. SHYFTs only reward strategy is to promote into people-management roles which does not work and only hinders the career growth of employees. There are a number of people who shouldn't be managing a team who compensate by being too aggressive about their position.HR - Concerned with Glassdoor reviews and forcing a "fun culture" but not much else. Most working here are annoyed by this and wish they'd understand forced fun doesn't equal fun. They also tend to be the gossip-center of the company even though they fired someone recently - it seemed like they were using this person as an example. That said they don't exactly know the best way of addressing situations and can be a bit rash. There have been complaints about inappropriate actions of other employees (of serious nature) that nothing has been done about.Advice to ManagementFigure out alternative promotion paths. Understand company goals and values and use them in practice (beyond "we're a fun place to work").Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) SHYFT Analytics Response Apr 18, 2017 – VP, Customer Success Thanks for sharing your candid feedback and concerns. We agree that there’s a need for an alternate growth path in Customer Success that isn’t dependent on project and/or people management. Asand change, the different roles that are needed and the opportunities within those organizations evolve too. During our last review cycle as we looked at our team and our career matrix, it became clear that having a single path to career growth in Customer Success wasn’t going to work for a number of the talented members of our team, and would eventually drive them to seek that growth somewhere else. The head of our Customer Success Tech Team and I have been working with our Talent Team to define a parallel path for Subject Matter Experts –people who want to achieve career growth, but don’t want to grow into management roles. Instead they want to deepen their knowledge of technical areas, commercial/clinical analytics and clinical data – and there’s a need for this too as we strengthen our customer relationships. It’s taken some time to define the roles and the initial path for growth, but we’ve had conversations with some folks who want to move in this direction to help inform this process. So as promised in our last CS All Hands meeting, the new career matrix with the definition of these additional pathways to growth is scheduled to be released and posted to our internal talent management system by the end of April. It’s important that we continue to evaluate the career matrix on a periodic basis since organizations aren’t static – as products and offerings evolve, our customer relationships evolve and our company matures, we expect the opportunities for our teams to evolve right along with it. - Adriana... MoreLess SHYFT Analytics 2017-04-14 10:15 PDT Mar 10, 2017 Helpful (11)"Trouble in Paradise"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at SHYFT Analytics full-timeProsHigh paced company with lots of responsibilities right off the bat. Great place to get a lot of experience right out of college and make a lasting impact on a company.Fun culture - shuffle board, pool table, bar area and beer always in the fridge. People are for the most part sociable and easy to work with and like to have fun while also working hard.ConsTrying to shift from a consulting company to a product company while also expecting employees to work consultant hours. One team spent months without weekends due to high profile client and rocky implementation.Classic growing pains, but to the extreme - sales team vastly oversells and company is forced to deliver with minimal resources -- leading to most employees are overworked and underpaid. (No overtime compensation of course)Favoritism. Your reputation with coworkers and higher ups (whether you deserve it or not) is hard to shake. Everyone gossips - most of all HR which is baffling.Lastly, review process is not transparent enough. If you're given a mediocre raise, you're given it with complements to how awesome you've been doing and no criticism to support why you don't deserve more.Advice to ManagementSpend more time on one on ones with your employees before more quit and the company is left with a lot of clients and no customer support. "Open door policy" from the higher ups doesnt seem convincing enough to guarantee confidentiality and support. Actions speak louder than words.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (11) SHYFT Analytics Response Mar 21, 2017 – VP, Talent Thanks for providing your feedback. I’m glad you feel you have a place to safely discuss, although I (as well as the others from the SHYFT Leadership and Talent Teams) wish we got an opportunity toive first. We take your feedback very seriously and investigate all issues (at all levels) to understand where we can be doing better. There are times where these investigations produce truthful data that results in consequences. Given we take all feedback and acquisitions seriously, we hope you do too. SHYFT is in rapid growth mode and approaching a pivotal time in any companies’ existence; 150 people. The Leadership Team works very hard to align cross organizationally to eliminate growing pains and tighten our processes, but we can always do better. We want to continue to grow our amazing culture and strive to be transparent in all ways possible. Its important now more than ever that we stick to the philosophies that have made this culture so great; “Fit First” Hiring, Meritocracy, Hard Work, Transparency, Trust, and our Core Values. We should all be proud of what we are growing. We want to give you the opportunity to grow with the company and to be recognized for the hard work we are all doing. We have added and continue to add new programs that enable you, your growth, and a stronger employee/manager relationship. These programs will take some time to make impact, but we are moving the needle. My door is always open (unless I’m in a meeting) and I know the other leaders operate the same way. Actions do speak louder than words, but remember that it goes in both ways. We need our people to trust that that we are always doing what is best for SHYFT and to come tell us what is going on.

The managers that are great really make a difference. The organization is focusing on developing training for managers and across the board for all employees.The company really does care about their culture, and has plenty of fun events that staff are encouraged to attend.If you're young, this is a great place for initial career development, as long as you can demonstrate that you're ready for the next level.ConsLack of clear expectations of managers makes experiences of direct reports vary by team and project. Some managers may lack leadership and project management skills required to enable efficient and successful teams. Furthermore, it seems that some managers create a toxic environment for their team at times. This isn't an issue that's specific to SHYFT, but it would be great if we could get ahead of it.Long hours depending on project can reach very rough levels.Additionally, the organization is currently trying to make significant, and important changes. However, a lack of standardized processes and clear planning on how to implement the changes are causing frustrating growing pains. Hopefully we will get past them in 2017.Advice to ManagementPromote employees who are both great individual contributors and have some LEADERSHIP skills to management positions. Creating a management training program is a great first step, but training sessions alone do not make good managers. The learnings from this training need to be continuously reinforced, and managers of all levels need to be coached and mentored. Please don't just put out a manager training and think that this alone will solve management problems.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) SHYFT Analytics Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SHYFT Analytics 2017-01-26 05:50 PST Jan 17, 2017 Helpful (3)"Good place to start career...depending on team"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Solution Consultant in Waltham, MAFormer Employee - Solution Consultant in Waltham, MADoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at SHYFT Analytics full-time (More than a year)Pros- Decent responsibilities right off the bat, if this is your first job out of college- Colleagues are super smart for the most part- Most people are friendly and helpfulCons- Managers tend to be incompetent, and often micro-manage- Long hours (mostly due to manager's not knowing how to push back on client)- Pay is below industry average- Company is branding itself as a product company, but every single solution is custom made- Was told it would be a "consulting" position, but really just data QA (and even much worse for other projects)Advice to Management- Invest in developing your managers- Do a better job at setting expectations from interview stages- Increase salaries across the boardShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) SHYFT Analytics Response Jan 25, 2017 – VP, Customer Success Thanks so much for the feedback.  You’ve highlighted some areas that have been and continue to be a focus for us as we continue to grow and evolve SHYFT. Most of our managers have grown up in ourreally understand our products, customers and industry.  There’s a lot of benefits to internal promotions, but you’re right that it means that we need to provide training and help new managers prepare as they move into new roles.  In December we piloted a new manager training program and all managers and those poised to be managers will be going through it this year.  And we continue to work with our partners on our Talent Team to evolve all training but especially for our managers to give them more tools and approaches as they manage teams with different levels of experience.    Over the past two years we have actively evolved from a technology-enabled services company to a services-enabled product company.  The transition isn’t easy and it doesn’t happen overnight, especially not with some legacy customers who frankly did have more bespoke solutions, but we’re actively moving them to our upgraded products and standard solutions.  However, as a company with an evolving product platform, there are areas where we leverage customer requests to innovate our products.  During 2016 and into 2017, our product roadmap has moved the needle significantly, driving more automation, standardization and allowing our teams to drive value in our customer relationships especially as our team members mature.       On an annual basis, our Talent Team collects real market salary data to ensure our salary bands remain competitive in the markets where we are hiring. Our goal is to construct compensation and total reward packages (base salary, bonus, and stock options) that align with the individuals experience level, difficulty of role, as well as general market demand for the skillset. This is something that we will continue to monitor and adjust as needed.    Thanks again for the honest feedback.  I welcome open dialogue -- it's an important part of the culture and company we are building together.   Best, Adriana... MoreLess SHYFT Analytics 2017-01-17 20:06 PST Showing 35 of 36 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious1234NextReviews > SHYFT Analytics RSS Feed</>Embed SHYFT Analytics Careers With a long history of success and deep client partnerships, we understand the market transformation and the actionable intelligence...    – More Why Join Us?
