In 2004, Vedior sold its minority interest in TriNet to General Atlantic, a growth equity firm.[4]
In May 2008, Burton Goldfield joined the company as president and CEO. Babinec remained at the company as a director.[5]

Additionally, the Company helps clients manage their risk by providing risk management services, including performing workplace assessment, safety consultation, accident investigation and other risk management services at its client locations to help prevent workplace accidents that could lead to claims. It also provides services to help remediate such claims when they occur.The Company provides Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) coverage for its clients through insurance policies that the Company obtains from its third-party EPLI insurance carrier. These policies provide coverage for certain claims that arise in the course of the employment relationship, such as discrimination, harassment, and certain other employee claims with a per-claim retention amount. For its clients, the retention amount is split between the client and TriNet, with the client paying its portion of the retention amount first. For claims covered by its EPLI insurance, actual litigation defense is conducted by outside employment law firms with whom the Company and its EPLI carriers have previously negotiated rates, established billing guidelines and invoice review processes. It has also developed a case management protocol to defend such claims.The Company products and services are designed to help its clients comply with local, state and federal employment and benefit laws. The Company monitors employer-related developments and assist clients in complying with changing regulations and requirements at all levels, from changes in local minimum wage and family leave ordinances to sweeping reforms, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).The Company competes with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Insperity, Inc.

History[edit]
TriNet was founded in 1988 by Martin Babinec. Babinec led TriNet through several acquisitions of smaller PEOs, including John Parry & Alexander and the Outsource Group of Walnut Creek, Calif.; E3 Group Inc. of Dallas, ALTRES (Alternative Resources for Business) of Honolulu, Hawaii; and Boston-based HR Logic Holdings, Inc.[3] At the same time, the company went through its own rounds of equity financing, including an investment by U.K.-based staffing firm Select Holdings, LLC (later renamed as Vedior). In 2004, Vedior sold its minority interest in TriNet to General Atlantic, a growth equity firm.[4]
In May 2008, Burton Goldfield joined the company as president and CEO. Babinec remained at the company as a director.[5]
In March 2014 TriNet launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol TNET.[citation needed]
On March 27, 2014, Burton Goldfield, TriNet CEO, discussed its IPO, competitors, and future with Mad Money host Jim Cramer.[6]

COBRA administration for your former employees, including notices and payment collection
Plan documents, required notices and filings for health and retirement plans

SAN LEANDRO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 06/07/17 --  TriNet (NYSE: TNET), a leading provider of HR services, today introduced TriNet Main Street. TriNet Main Street is an HR solution designed to meet the requirements of the hundreds of thousands1 of local and owner-operated businesses in the United States. 
Often considered the lifeblood of the economy, these companies typically have workforces comprised of salaried, hourly, part-time and seasonal employees. This causes a high degree of HR complexity for businesses in industries such as hospitality, retail and manufacturing. Whether it's handling wage and hour regulations or managing workplace safety, the HR demands are dynamic and difficult to manage. 
TriNet Main Street was designed to solve these specific HR needs with a full-service solution featuring payroll, time and attendance, workers' compensation, employee benefits, technology, compliance and HR expertise. Businesses no longer have to choose between stitching together a series of point solutions or accepting one-size-fits-all HR products that don't fully meet their needs. TriNet's new solution relieves the onerous HR burden these businesses face, resulting in precious time savings and peace of mind for owners and operators. 
Key features include: 


Agile payroll: Payroll is challenging and time consuming for industries that manage a multitude of hourly, seasonal and off-site workers. TriNet's payroll functionality reduces the burden on the business and minimizes errors by tackling the complexity of processing payroll and tips, calculating net pay, incorporating time and attendance, handling tax withholdings and complying with federal reporting requirements. Integrations with point-of-sale (POS) and global ledger (GL) systems allow data to be controlled with SMBs' organization structures and business priorities in mind. 



Robust time and attendance: The ability to efficiently and accurately manage hourly employee data is critical for these businesses. TriNet Main Street responds to this need with a robust time and attendance capability. Its scheduling and time entry features make assigning and monitoring shifts effortless. This function is a core component of TriNet's solution, enabling a seamless flow of time and attendance data directly into the payroll, ensuring less time spent on manual entry or any resulting errors.



Streamlined and secure technology: With an online self-service platform and mobile app, TriNet Main Street allows employees to manage and update their personal HR information. Simplified online processes for hiring, onboarding, leave and terminations cut down the paperwork generated by the employee turnover typically seen in Main Street industries. Online benefits enrollment and support give employees control over their options. Enterprise-level capabilities in reporting, analytics and job costing allow insights into large line items and provide business owners with more control over their bottom line.Users have access to:View and edit personal information, including life status changesManage time-off requests and payroll submissionsGuided benefits enrollment wizardSimplified onboarding and terminations management



Expert compliance and risk mitigation support: Numerous regulations are a particular burden on companies with a flexible workforce. Staying ahead of changing regulations on wage and hour, health care and overtime regulations requires constant attention, and costly penalties for non-compliance can be a drain on a low-margin business. TriNet Main Street offers multi-state services that assist with compliance with these regulations. A team of HR experts, along with access to an extensive knowledge base, helps guide businesses through the constantly changing world of compliance regulations. 


TriNet also provides risk management services to help protect business interests with HR guidance, employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) coverage, claims management and online support. 



Cost-effective employer and employee benefits: TriNet Main Street's workers' compensation program includes A+ rated carrier coverage, workplace safety training courses, hazard assessments and claims management to help small and midsize businesses (SMBs) with expedited resolutions and fraud prevention. TriNet's workers' compensation offering helps improve cash flow management, providing robust support with no deposits or deductibles and pay-as-you-go billing. 


TriNet Main Street provides SMBs access to large-employer benefit plans that may otherwise not be available in their markets.
