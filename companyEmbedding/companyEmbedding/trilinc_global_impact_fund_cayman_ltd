 BOARD OF MANAGERS - INDEPENDENT MEMBERS


The following are the Independent Members of TriLinc's Board of Managers.



Terry Otton, Independent Manager
                  Terry Otton served as Chief Executive Officer of RS Investments from September 2005 until his retirement
in March 2012 and as President and Trustee of RS Investment Trust and RS Variable Products Trust since April
2004 and May 2006 until March 2012, respectively. Mr. Otton re-joined RS Investments in 2004 and became
Chief Executive Officer in September 2005. Mr. Otton has 30 years of experience in the investment management
and securities industry, having previously served since 2001 as a Managing Director of the mergers and
acquisition practice at Putnam Lovell NBF Group, an investment banking firm focused on the investment
management and securities industry. Previously, Mr. Otton spent more than 10 years as a Managing Director and
CFO of Robertson, Stephens & Company and Robertson Stephens Investment Management, the predecessor to
RS Investments. Mr. Otton was one of the principal founders of Robertson Stephens Investment Management in
1986. Mr. Otton serves on the Board of Trustees of the Children’s Hospital and Research Center Foundation and
as a Board member and past President of the Foundation of City College of San Francisco and serves on the
Board of Trustees of the Cal State East Bay Educational Foundation Board. Mr. Otton holds a Bachelor of
Science degree in Business Administration from the University of California at Berkeley and is a Certified Public
Accountant.
                  Mr. Otton was selected to serve on the Company’s board of managers because of his over 30 years of
experience in the investment management and securities industry. Having most recently served as Chief
Executive Officer of RS Investments and President and Trustee of RS Investment Trust and RS Variable
Products Trust, Mr. Otton brings recent and relevant perspective on the state of the investment management
industry. He is also able to provide valuable insight with regard to our investment strategy, regulatory and
compliance oversight and operational processes.



Cynthia Hostetler, Independent Manager
Cynthia Hostetler has been an independent trustee of the Artio Global Investment Funds since November
2011 and an independent director of Artio Global Equity Fund Inc. since November 2010 until 2013, when Artio
Global was acquired by Aberdeen Asset Management. Since 2013, Ms. Hostetler has served as an independent
trustee of the Aberdeen Investment Funds. Ms. Hostetler has also served since May 2012 as an independent
director of Edgen Group (NYSE:EDG), an energy infrastructure company. EDG was acquired by Sumitomo
Corporation in late 2013. Additionally, Ms. Hostetler has served on the Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials
Company (NYSE: VMC), a producer of construction aggregates and other construction materials, since July

Vice President of Investment Funds at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Prior to OPIC,

Ms. Hostetler began her professional career as an attorney in the corporate/banking department of the law firm
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University and her
law degree from The University of Virginia School of Law.
Ms. Hostetler was selected to serve on the Company’s board of managers because of her direct experience
in investing and development in the geographic regions in which TriLinc operates, as well as her extensive
experience in the banking and investment industries. As TriLinc seeks to establish and leverage relationships
with DFIs, Ms. Hostetler’s seven years as Vice President of Investment Funds at OPIC should position her as an
excellent source of insight and guidance in working with these institutions. Her diverse board positions make her
a valuable resource in the areas of risk management, governance, valuation and with regard to certain sectors in
which we anticipate making investments.



R. Michael Barth, Independent Manager

the world. Mr. Barth holds a Masters Degree in International Economics / International Affairs from the Johns
Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics from

                  Mr. Barth was selected to serve on the Company’s board of managers because of his distinguished career in
emerging markets development and investment. His qualifications to serve on the Company’s board of managers
span more than 30 years’ of relevant experience in development/emerging markets, including serving as Chief
Executive Officer of FMO (Netherlands Development Finance Company), Director of the Capital Markets
