	                      "I wanted to 
	                      thank you for getting the new telephone batteries to us so soon!. We 
	                      were having phone problems and the quick service was appreciated. I 
	                      purchase many things from websites and once many of them have the order 
	                      they don't seem to worry about how long it takes for the products to 
	                      arrive... I really appreciate the follow-up to my status request email 
	                      and that the batteries arrived even sooner than we had planned."

              Weight                     How much does the ladder weigh?         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6306 weighs 22lbs.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-08-13                the 300 lb rating does this mean if my tech is 290 lb I should be ok with the 300 lb ladder if he gains 10 lb do i need to go with the 375 lb           Asked by: Anonymous             You also have to factor in the persons clothing and materials ne utilized. If that total weight is over 300 LBS then yes you need to procure a 375 LB rated ladder for the tech to utilize on the job.

Thank you for your inquiry.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-05-03                Suitability for use on electrical systems                     Hi, is this ladder rated for use on electrical systems. Specifically 277 volt lighting and 480 volt power systems.

Thanks.         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6308 is a fiberglass ladder that is recommended for use around electrical. We have no voltage recommendations/comparisons.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-05-03                Availability                     Is this ladder still available for purchase if so where can i locate it ?         Asked by: Anonymous             Product stock and availability are solely provided by distributors in your area. Please visit our website at www.wernerco.com and utilize our distributor locator to identify the nearest distributors in your area. This product may also be ordered online, through any distributor located on the product page.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-06-20                Color specification by capacity                     Why this Red Stepladder is for 375lb, when the color chart said the Yellow is for 375lb. and red is for 300lb. Any error in the description,.. please let me know is confuse for me, thanks!         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6306 is in fact rated at 375lbs. Not all ladders are color coded depending on their duty rating. The duty rating stickers located on the side rail of the ladder will reference the weight.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-03-05                What is the difference between the 6306 and the NTX1A06?           Asked by: Anonymous             The rails and the steps are the same between the NXT1A06 and the 6206 fiberglass step ladders. The difference between the ladders are the colors of the top and braces, and the attaching hardware for the respective pieces. Both ladders comply with the 300 pound rating.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-05-18                Dealer distributor does not locate anyone within 200 miles of my location , and the only 2 online distributors states it has been discontinued however           Asked by: Anonymous             The 6307 can be ordered online, or through a local distributor. Please visit the 6307 product page, and view the Buy Now feature on the site for an online distributor who carries this product. Using the Where to Buy feature will show a list of distributors who have recently purchased this product. Because the 7 foot ladder is not a common size, a local distributor may not have previously purchased one. Using the Find a Dealer Near You on the Werner Co. home page will show a list of all distributors in the area who could special order this product if they do not have it available.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-06-27                What is the minimum tempurature the model# 6306 ladder can be used?           Asked by: Anonymous             Please contact Customer Care at 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. We have a fiberglass technical manual that we can email to you that includes this information.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-12-06                Is the latter exactly 12 foot (144 inches)?                     I have 12 foot ceilings and trying to find the tallest ladder that will fit in the room, would prefer it to be 11'10&quot; or as close as I can get.         Asked by: Anonymous             The shipping length is 12 feet(144 inches)            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-10-22                Weight                     Is there a visible difference between a 300lb ladder versus a 375lb ladder? Different color top pad or anything?         Asked by: Anonymous             The only big difference between the 6312 and the 6212 besides the duty rating would be the color of the plastic top. The 6212 has a yellow lock in top while the 6312 has a black lock in top.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.
