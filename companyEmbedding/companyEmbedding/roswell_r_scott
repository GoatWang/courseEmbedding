He was so confident on the phone and after reading the reviews I booked for today. I just left and the color is exactly what I wanted!!! :-)  Finally, I found the person I will continue to see for my hair color!! He and his wife kept me at ease, talked me through the different colors he could do and when it was done, I felt so happy when I left. Thank you soooo much Tony!!! Just a tip for anyone, I had my husband drop me off and pick me up to my appointment so I wouldn't have to look for parking. :-) This was completely worth itIo SalonPat M. ratedNate at Io salon is a true master of hair extensions,....yes, I said the E word, but being a former victim of hair extension abuse and ready to write them off as a lost cause, I know what I'm talking about. He uses the finest quality hair, from Balmain ( and you thought they only did beautiful leather goods) and his application and technique is on a whole different level. These extensions are so natural and comfortable to wear that I'm in love with my hair all over again, thanks to Nate,...he is an absolute genius when it comes to hair. He  has the most wonderful bedside manner and  best of all, he gives respect back to the whole world of extensionsSoda SalonBrian H. ratedGreat Experience with AshleyMy wife loved her visit to Soda. She showed Ashley Eryn the haircut she wanted and Ashley took the time to really look at it in terms of her hair type and asked multiple questions. She knew exactly what my wife wanted.  She cut off a considerable amount of hair but after talking to Ashley about what they were doing, she was never apprehensive. My wife knew She was in capable hands.  In just over an hour, she had the haircut she wanted for not much more than what she had been paying her former stylist.  Overall, she couldn't be happier with her experience, the cut, and the feel of the salon. She really can't wait to go back for her next trip! Soda SalonLauren S. ratedSoda is an amazing hair salon. You get exactly what you pay for. It can be pricey to those used to not spending a lot on their hair but this is worth it. I was paying a low amount for a hair dresser down the street and she ruined my hair. i found Francesca and she brought my hair back to life. I recommend everyone try this place. They treat you great and it's the best salon in Roswell. Francesca is the best!! She is always pleasant and knows exactly how to cut and color my hair without me having to say anything. I don't know hair or colors, I just know how I want it to look. She listens to your concerns and cares about her customers. Kookoo Bear Baby & Kidsmaryy170 ratedI have had nothing but great experiences with KooKoo Bear!  While our children were too old to need nursery decor when we moved here we have bought several baby gifts from the store.  We were also just approved as foster parents for little ones but needed a crib.  Everyone that had a free one to offer us had a drop side (which is no longer considered safe) so we weren't able to use them.  KooKoo Bear went above and beyond and GAVE us a beautiful crib!!!  Wow! We will most definitely be going to KooKoo Bear in the future for gifts and whatever else we may need in the "kid" arena!  Thank you so much KooKoo Bear Kids!Soda SalonCharity C. ratedAshley was AMAZING!! I went into Soda Salon earlier this year to get a smoothing treatment done. I was super nervous because I naturally have giant curls and had never done anything as drastic as a smoothing treatment. Ashley was very nice and told me the process beforehand. The process was long but she made sure me and my guest had drinks & even told us of some great places to eat! I was very pleased with my style. It was smooth & was heavy. It lasted from February to July and I absolutely loved it. If you're looking for a great stylist and a friendly person if definitely recommend Ashley A.!Kookoo Bear Baby & KidsMatthewleoi I. ratedI love this place. I purchase all of my baby gifts from them the service has been great and the products selection is the best in Georgia. I also purchased all of my kid’s furniture from them and it came as expected. I know Stanly is having a difficult time delivering but the owner at KoKoo Bear worked with me and help me select the products she knew they would be able to ship in a reasonable time frame. I have purchased products from other kid’s stores in Atlanta but no one works with me like the staff at KooKoo Bear I think they are the best.Kookoo Bear Baby & KidsAngelina A. ratedThis store just helped us out of a major jam. The company we purchased furniture from closed and we were about to deliver our baby. We called the manufacturer and they referred us to Koo Koo Bear to help us get our furniture. I have to say they jumped through hoops to get our furniture here in a couple of days and saved the day. I wish we would of went to them first. When we went to the store to pick up our furniture we fell in love with the store and the staff we met that helped us so much. You guys really saved the day!Dominican Sugar Hair Salonnellie85 ratedI have had several blowouts in...I have had several blowouts in my time....I am VERY pleased with my results  from Dominican Sugar.  I have gone to the salon a total of three times and two different stylist have provided service to me.  Both times the final product was FANTASTIC.  I've had the following services: blow out, deep conditioner, and trim.  I plan to visit them today in order to prepare for the Holiday.  I have natural hair and I also like the fact that my curl patten has not been altered by the blow outs from Dominican Sugar.Kookoo Bear Baby & KidsJoshuakfi I. ratedKoo Koo Bear Kids really went out of their way to help us get the rest of our furniture after the store we ordered it from went out of business abruptly just weeks before our baby is due to arrive. Their commitment to customer service was evident when the owners personally met us at the warehouse to pick up the furniture. We really appreciate it Joe and Tara (and everyone who helped us out at Koo Koo Bear Kids) and we'll bring our business back when we expand our family in the future.Did You Know?Plumbing ProblemsIf you own a house or commercial building, you're bound to need a plumber at some point. Here's a list of the different kinds of plumbing services you might need assistance with:Pipe Installation
You might only think of needing a plumber when the pipes in your house burst. However, a plumbing contractor also installs all of those pipes, whether they're made of PVC or copper, in your building. Professional plumbing services also lay pipe in place for wastewater, rainwater runoff and even air conditioning systems.Not only do they install pipes, plumbers set up sewer lines and vents as well as gutters, down pipes and storage tanks for residential and commercial facilities.Maintenance Work
Just like getting a regular oil change for your car or truck, your home's pipes and water system also need regular maintenance and check-ups to ensure they're running right. This is why plumbers also offer upkeep services to test your entire plumbing system on a monthly or biannual basis to catch any issues with your pipes before they become an emergency.This type of work spans from moving a water line or cleaning a sewer line to installing an ice maker or even a hot tub.Repair Services
Most likely, you'll need a plumber in case of an emergency repair. Services can run the gamut from repairing a clogged toilet and leaking faucets to replacing whole water heating systems. Some jobs can take just a few hours while others might require a day or two of work if the repairs are extensive, such as replacing a hot water heater.Other tough jobs could require your plumbing contractor to put his or her carpentry skills to work by sawing through walls to get to your pipes.Consultancy
You can also hire a plumber to get the cost-saving advice you need. If you're interested in buying a new home or property, it's smart to hire a contractor or a plumbing service to not only tell you if the building's foundation is sound, but also if the pipes are in good working order. You wouldn't want to purchase a new house and repair the damage someone else did to the property. This is why many plumbers also offer consultancy work to check a facility's water and gas systems and advise home and building owners on best practices they can perform to minimize damage to their pipes.What to Ask a PlumberHaving plumbing work done, whether it's for your home or business, can be incredibly expensive. That's why it's vital for you to ask a plumbing service the right kind of questions before you hire them. You want to do as much due diligence on your part as possible to get a professional who will not only do quality work but also charge you a fair price for it.It's best to hire a plumber to do a simple, everyday maintenance task for you first so you can judge his or her work. If you're happy with it, save their contact information so you'll have them on hand in case you need an emergency repair. This can spare you the extra worry and anxiety of having to track down a plumber if you have a broken pipe. Additionally, it can save you from being overcharged.However, what should you ask a plumbing service if you've never even hired one before? Here are a few questions that can help you identify the professional from the amateur:Are you licensed and registered?
Some states do not require plumbers to be licensed, but for the safety of your house, the people living under your roof and for your pocketbook, you'll want a licensed plumber to do the needed work.A licensed plumber means the person completed the necessary education or training required to work as a professional tradesperson. Hiring a licensed plumbing service means the people working on your building are knowledgeable about water and gas pipes. If you use unlicensed workers, you run the risk of them damaging your home even further and endangering you by doing faulty work.Check your state's laws beforehand, as hiring an unlicensed plumber could be illegal where you live.Not only do plumber apprentices have to complete their training and education to receive their licenses, they also are required to pass a criminal background check and carry liability insurance. Hiring just anybody can make you vulnerable to fraud since unlicensed plumbers might not know what they're doing or could pretend to fix something and end up charging you for the incomplete work.Are you insured and bonded?
A trustworthy plumber will have both commercial liability insurance as well as be bonded. The insurance and the bond protects the plumber from paying for any damages made to your house out of pocket. Having professionals that carry both of these policies can protect all of you from any mishaps that could occur while they work on your building. Remember, not all plumbers are the same and not all of them carry the necessary insurance and bonds to protect themselves and your home from damage or shoddy work.How many years have you been in business?
Not only do you want a licensed and trustworthy professional, you'll want one who's been in business for a few years. More experience also means the plumber will have a prior work history you can check. A more inexperienced plumber might not have many customer reviews or examples of his or her work to show you.What, if any, professional associations do you belong to?
It can never hurt to ask plumbers if they're part of a professional association, whether it's a state or national group. Being a part of a professional organization provides an extra guarantee that the person you hire is licensed and offers you a warranty for their labor.May I have a list of references?
While it's advisable to ask friends, family and neighbors if they can recommend a good plumber, they might not have anyone you can call. With that said, it's best to ask a plumbing service for a list of references that you can contact to get a good picture of the kind of work their business does and if it's quality or not.Before you hire a plumber, contact their past customers if you're able to. These people can be a wealth of information if you ask them the right questions. Pose the following queries to these former patrons when you get the chance:Were you pleased with the work done?Was the project completed on time?Did the plumber give you a written warranty and guarantee his or her work?Were there any unexpected costs that arose?Would you hire this plumber again? If not, why?Do you offer a written warranty for your work?
Whenever you make a large purchase, you always request a receipt, right? Well, you will want a written warranty for any work or repairs done to the plumbing in your house. You want someone that's doing major maintenance or repair work on your house or commercial building to stand by his or her labor. Before you hire a plumber, ask him or her if they offer written warranties.Will I need a permit for this work?
If a plumber needs to do major repairs to your house, the work could call for a permit. You'll want this since a permit provides added assurance that the work is done correctly. Having this added measure in place means an inspector will check the work your contractor or plumber does to ensure he or she did the job correctly. If you ever plan on putting your house or commercial building on the market, a real estate agent and prospective buyers will also want to check any large work you did to make sure it was done properly.Avoiding a ScamTo keep yourself safe from fraud or a possible scam, always remember to ask plumbers for their license along with a written warranty for their labor. Besides this, further safeguard yourself by checking their references and ensure they or their company is insured and bonded to do their work.How to Get the Most From Your PipesWhile it's smart to get maintenance work done on your pipes every once in a while, there are a number of prevention tips that will not only prolong the life of your pipes but also help you save on your water bill. Here are a few you should keep in mind:Water Conservation
Be mindful of how much water you use in your bathroom, kitchen and even outdoors when watering your lawn. Make sure your toilet handle works properly and doesn't stick. You don't want it continuously flushing. Replace your old shower heads with more efficient low-flow options that can cut down on the gallons of water you use each morning.Simple things such as turning off the sink while you brush your teeth or only running your dishwasher or clothes washer when you have a full load to clean can make more efficient use of water.Prevention Tips
You won't always need to call a plumber to help you fix a nasty clog if you treat your pipes right. Don't use your toilet or kitchen sink like a trash can by stuffing hard to flush material down the drain or pouring fats and oils down the pipe. Throw coffee grounds and eggshells in the garage instead of in your sink. Also, only use your toilet to flush human waste and toilet paper, because any other materials could clog your commode.Seasonal Tips
Frozen pipes are hazardous and can cause massive amounts of damage to your home. To prevent your pipes from freezing during the winter, run your faucets at a trickle and keep your house's heater at 55 degrees Fahrenheit or above to keep the water flowing.Common Plumbing ProblemsPlumbing problems come in all shapes and sizes. The following are some of the most common, as well as how to fix them:Discolored Water
If you turn on your bathroom or kitchen sink in the morning to find brown or rust-colored water coming out of your faucet, don't panic. The discoloration is most likely due to old iron pipes or recent use of a hydrant or water main that disturbed the usual flow of water. Keep your water running for a minute or so and it should run clear after a while.Leaky and Dripping Faucets
Having a leaking or dripping faucet can run up your water bill. To fix it, first shut off the water under the sink then remove any decorative parts of the faucet and replace the washer and O-ring before reassembling everything.Water Heater
Your water heater could be the cause of a lot of issues around your home, from a lack of hot water to foul smells and popping sounds. Hire a professional plumber to take care of the more complex jobs that a heater can require. However, if you're having hot water issues, you can simply examine the thermostat and adjust it accordingly.If you hear odd sounds coming from your water heater, it could be due to sediment building up. To get rid of this, make sure you clean out the heater every few months. However, if you hear a boiling noise, it could mean the heater is overheating and you should call a plumbing professional as soon as possible.Drain and Toilet Clogs
Before calling a plumber, try to unclog your drains and toilets yourself by using a plunger. Make sure you use a standard bell-shaped plunger for your sink and shower drains and a plunger with a flanged end for your toilets. If neither type can loosen the pipe blockage, put a plumber's snake to use. Ratchet the snake down the pipe to eliminate any clogs.
