Cetera Advisor Networks is an independent broker-dealer that was founded in 1983 as Financial Network Investment Corporation, a pioneer on the emergent independent-contractor broker-dealer scene. It was built on the belief that financial advisors could enjoy even greater success by joining high-performance teams offering local support and guidance, while sharing best practices across a nationwide network. From that belief, the firm's hallmark regional model was born – a model that built the firm into one of the nation's largest and most successful independent broker-dealers.

 FINRA Rules 2090 & 2111








Welcome! Your financial representative may have referred you to this page to learn more about an upcoming regulatory rule change, intended to help protect investors, that is scheduled to go into effect later this year. As your financial representative's broker-dealer, Cetera Advisor Networks plays an important role in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and adapting to rule changes. Although this upcoming rule change will not become effective until July 9, 2012, we are working to facilitate the transition in advance of the regulation deadline to ensure that both our firm and your financial professional are fully prepared.BackgroundIn 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved two new rules, both modifications of existing rules, that were proposed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA is the largest independent regulator of the U.S. securities industry (previously known as the National Association of Securities Dealers, or NASD). As summarized in its mission statement, “FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation of the securities industry.”These new rules, Rules 2090 and 2111 (described below under More about the Rules), expand upon previous industry regulations. As a result, your financial representative may need to ask you for updated or additional information in order to ensure he or she is in full compliance with the new rules.What type of information might I need to provide to my financial representative, and why?Included in the information that must be collected and maintained in order to comply with the new rules are a customer’s risk tolerance, liquid net worth, account liquidity needs andinvestments held elsewhere. Your representative will explain to you the exact information needed.What if I’ve already given my representative this information?Even if you have already provided this information to your representative in the past, you may be asked for it again, as this information must be captured and maintained in a newly required format.Will I notice any other changes?In the coming months, you may also notice that paperwork needed to create a new account or update information on an existing account has been expanded and updated. If you receive letters periodically confirming your financial status or account needs, you will notice they have been expanded and updated.How can I ensure I’m protected?There are a number of steps you can take to help protect yourself and your information. When providing information or discussing your account over the phone, be absolutely certain you are speaking with your representative or someone from their office. If you ever suspect that an individual who has called you is not from your representative’s office, simply tell them you need to call back, then hang up and call the office using the number you have on file.Other steps you can take to help protect yourself and your information can be found here on our Security page. Additional resources to help protect against fraud, scams and identity theft can be found on the following websites:FINRA — Protect YourselfFederal Trade Commission — ID Theft and Data SecurityMore about the RulesFINRA Rules 2090 and 2111 are two interrelated rules that are modifications of two former rules, NYSE 405 and NASD 2310, but also expand on those rules. By requiring firms, or “members,” to collect and maintain a range of information about customers’ financial status and account needs, these rules are designed to help ensure that financial representatives have the information necessary to make recommendations that are suitable to their individual customers.Below is the wording of the new rules. Complete details and background information on the rules can be found in FINRA’s Regulatory Notice 11-25. Though this language is geared toward industry professionals rather than individual investors, it may help you understand the essence of the rules.Rule 2090 (Know Your Customer)Every member shall use reasonable diligence, in regard to the opening and maintenance of every account, to know (and retain) the essential facts concerning every customer and concerning the authority of each person acting on behalf of such customer.Rule 2111 (Suitability)(a) A member or an associated person must have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security or securities is suitable for the customer, based on the information obtained through the reasonable diligence of the member or associated person to ascertain the customer’s investment profile. A customer’s investment profile includes, but is not limited to, the customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information the customer may disclose to the member or associated person in connection with such recommendation.(b) A member or associated person fulfills the customer-specific suitability obligation for an institutional account, as defined in NASD Rule 3110(c)(4), if (1) the member or associated person has a reasonable basis to believe that the institutional customer is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to particular transactions and investment strategies involving a security or securities and (2) the institutional customer affirmatively indicates that it is exercising independent judgment in evaluating the member’s or associated person’s recommendations. Where an institutional customer has delegated decision-making authority to an agent, such as an investment adviser or a bank trust department, these factors shall be applied to the agent.Additional InformationPlease contact your financial representative if you have questions.

 529 Plan Disclosure








A 529 plan is a college savings plan that allows individuals to save for college on a tax-advantaged basis. Every state offers at least one 529 plan.Before buying a 529 plan, you should find out about the particular plan and its fees and expenses. You should also consider that certain states offer tax benefits and fee savings to in-state residents. Whether a state tax deduction and/or application fee savings are available depends on your state of residence. For tax advice, consult your tax professional. For information concerning 529 plans, including information comparing the performance of different states’ 529 plans, contact your financial professional.If you purchase a 529 plan through Cetera Advisor Networks, both Cetera Advisor Networks and your financial professional receive compensation from the 529 plan program sponsor in much the same manner as it does when you purchase mutual funds.

Cetera Advisor Networks LLC Key Developments

Cetera Financial Group Names Thomas B. Taylor President of Cetera Advisor Networks
Jan 25 17
Cetera Financial Group announced that it has named Thomas B. Taylor to the position of President of Cetera Advisor Networks. Mr. Taylor, currently Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Cetera Advisor Networks, will replace Douglas S. King as President effective immediately. Mr. King is departing the firm to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. Mr. Taylor with over 26 years of financial industry experience, joined Cetera Advisor Networks in 1997 and worked across a series of management roles, becoming Chief Operating Officer of the firm in 2006. During that time, he has been instrumental in developing many of the company's new operational, technological and sales initiatives. Before joining Cetera Advisor Networks, Mr. Taylor spent five years as a top-producing registered representative at Liberty Securities Corp./IFMG before being promoted to sales manager. Mr. King joined Cetera Advisor Networks as the firm's President in April 2012.


Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Fines Eight Firms a Total of $6.2 million for Supervisory Failures Related to Variable Annuity L-Shares
Nov 2 16
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that it has fined eight firms, including VOYA Financial Advisors, five broker-dealer subsidiaries of Cetera Financial Group, Kestra Investment Services, LLC, and FTB Advisors, Inc., a total of $6.2 million for failing to supervise sales of variable annuities (VAs). FINRA also ordered five of the firms to pay more than $6 million to customers who purchased L-share variable annuities with potentially incompatible, complex and expensive long-term minimum-income and withdrawal riders. FINRA imposed sanctions against the firms as: VOYA Financial Advisors Inc. was fined $2.75 million, Cetera Advisor Networks LLC was fined $750,000, Cetera Financial Specialists LLC was fined $350,000, First Allied Securities, Inc. was fined $950,000, Summit Brokerage Services, Inc. was fined $500,000, VSR Financial Services, Inc. was fined $400,000, Kestra Investment Services, LLC was fined $475,000 and FTB Advisors, Inc. was fined $250,000. FINRA ordered the firms to pay the to investors as: Voya was ordered to pay at least $1.8 million to customers in this category and Cetera Advisors Networks, First Allied, Summit Brokerage Services and VSR were collectively ordered to pay customers at least $4.5 million. The L-share VAs at the heart of this action are complex investment products combining insurance and security features designed for short-term investors willing to pay higher fees in exchange for shorter surrender periods. L-shares also had the potential to pay greater compensation to the firms and registered representatives than more traditional share classes. Each of the firms in this action lacked an adequate system to supervise variable annuities with multiple share classes, and failed to provide its registered representatives and principals with reasonable guidance regarding the narrow class of customers for whom the costs and features of L-share variable annuities were suitable. These failures were compounded by the fact that the short-surrender L-Shares were often sold with complex and expensive guaranteed income and withdrawal riders that provided benefits only over longer holding periods. These actions also included additional violations by Voya, Cetera Advisors Networks, Cetera Financial Specialists and VSR for failure to monitor rates of variable annuity exchanges at their respective firms.


Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Orders 12 Firms to Pay Restitution Totaling More than $4 Million and Fines Totaling More than $2.6 Million for Failing to Apply Available Sales Charge Discounts to Customers’ Purchases of Unit Investment Trusts and Related Supervisory Failures
Oct 20 15
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that it has ordered 12 firms to pay restitution totaling more than $4 million and fines totaling more than $2.6 million for failing to apply available sales charge discounts to customers’ purchases of Unit Investment Trusts (UITs), and related supervisory failures. FINRA imposed sanctions against the following firms: First Allied Securities, Inc. of San Diego, CA, was ordered to pay $689,647 in restitution and fined $325,000. Fifth Third Securities, Inc. of Cincinnati, OH, was ordered to pay $663,534 in restitution and fined $300,000. Securities America, Inc. of La Vista, NE, was ordered to pay $477,686 in restitution and fined $275,000. Cetera Advisors LLC of Denver, CO, was ordered to pay $452,622 in restitution and fined $250,000. Park Avenue Securities LLC of New York, NY, was ordered to pay $443,255 in restitution and fined $300,000. Commonwealth Financial Network of Waltham, MA, was ordered to pay $357,521 in restitution and fined $225,000. MetLife Securities, Inc. of New York, NY, was ordered to pay $349,748 in restitution and fined $300,000. Comerica Securities of Detroit, MI, was ordered to pay $197,757 in restitution and fined $150,000. Cetera Advisor Networks LLC of El Segundo, CA, was ordered to pay $151,108 in restitution and fined $150,000. Ameritas Investment Corp. of Lincoln, NE, was ordered to pay $128,544 in restitution and fined $150,000. Infinex Investments, Inc. of Meridian, CT, was ordered to pay $109,627 in restitution and fined $150,000. The Huntington Investment Company of Columbus, OH, was ordered to pay $60,973 in restitution and fined $75,000. A UIT is a type of investment company that offers redeemable units of a generally fixed portfolio of securities that terminate on a specific date. UIT sponsors generally offer sales charge discounts to investors, known as "breakpoint discounts" and "rollover and exchange discounts." A breakpoint discount is a reduced sales charge based on the dollar amount of the purchase—the higher the amount the greater the discount. Breakpoints generally function as a sliding reduction in the sales charge percentage available for purchases, usually beginning at $25,000 or $50,000 (or the corresponding number of units). A rollover or exchange discount is a reduced sales charge that is offered to investors who use the termination or redemption proceeds from one UIT to purchase another UIT. In March 2004, FINRA issued a Regulatory Notice to firms titled, Unit Investment Trust Sales, to remind broker-dealers that they should develop and implement procedures to ensure customers receive appropriate sales charge discounts for UITs. In concluding these settlements, the firms neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA’s findings.
