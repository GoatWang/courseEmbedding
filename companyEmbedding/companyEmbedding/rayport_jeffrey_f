Jeffrey F. Rayport is a strategic advisor in marketing services, online media, and e-commerce, with a focus on new business opportunities enabled by emerging digital technologies.
Rayport currently serves on the Faculty of the Harvard Business School in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit, where he teaches in both MBA and Executive Education programs.
Prior to his affiliation with HBS, Rayport was as an Operating Partner at Castanea Partners, a mid-size private equity firm specializing in retail, consumer brands, and marketing services, and a Special Advisor to Bain Capital Ventures. He was also Founder and Managing Partner of Marketspace LLC, a digital strategy and advisory firm. As a spin-off of that business, he co-founded and grew a custom executive development and e-learning business, which he established as an affiliate of Monitor Deloitte, where he was a Senior Partner. In related pursuits, Rayport was a co-founder and faculty member of several corporate universities, including at Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC); Bertelsmann AG; and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). As a keynote speaker, he is represented exclusively by Washington Speakers Bureau.
Previously, Rayport was a Faculty member at HBS for nearly a decade, teaching and doing research in Marketing and Service Management. While at HBS, he developed and delivered the first graduate-level e-commerce course in the nation, enrolling nearly 2,000 MBA students. In building the course, Rayport authored nearly a hundred case studies and related materials. Business plans written by students gave rise to dozens of start-ups, including Yahoo! Prior to his taking a leave from HBS, Rayport coined the term “viral marketing.” He was also voted Outstanding Professor for three years in a row by the HBS Students Association.
Rayport has published a series of leading MBA-level textbooks on strategy in the networked economy with McGraw-Hill/Irwin (e-Commerce, Cases in e-Commerce, and Introduction to e-Commerce) with co-author Bernard J. Jaworski. He and Jaworski also published a bestselling trade book for Harvard Business Review Press on reinventing service businesses, Best Face Forward: Why Companies Must Improve Their Service Interfaces with Customers.

He has contributed to other publications, including Bloomberg BusinessWeek, CIO Magazine, Financial Times, Fast Company, Forbes.com, Harvard Business Review, MarketWatch, McKinsey Quarterly, Strategy & Business, and MIT Technology Review.
He has served as a director of both public and private corporations. These include International Data Group; Hanley Wood; MediaMath; Monster Worldwide (NYSE:MWW); and Shoprunner.

Advertising's New Medium: Human Experience
Standard ad messaging and conventional creative executions and placements are rapidly becoming outmoded. To win consumers' attention and trust, marketers must think less about what advertising says to its targets and more about what it does for them. Rather than conceive ad campaigns that hammer home a point, they must think about advertising-- as well as the offerings it promotes -- as a sustained and rewarding presence in consumers' lives.



















Moving From Engagement to a Real Marriage of Brand and Customer
Customers have more power than ever before in the history of economic life in this country or any country in the developed world. Because there is way too much product and not enough demand and not enough customers to go around, we see an increadingly empowered customer. This represents a dramatic shift that has been taking place over the past 50 years....

                           "Based on extensive research inside both start-up and established businesses across many industries, Best Face Forward proposes
                              ways that companies can radically reengineer their front-office operations to deploy three types of service interfaces - people-dominant,
                              machine-dominant, and hybrids of the two." "This book shows how new roles for technology and people will radically reshape
                              business and competition - and ultimately create a "people-rich" workplace that benefits customers, employees, and shareholders."--Jacket

                              New products and services--some "real" and some "virtual"--Are being created wich dramatically affect how business is being
                                 transacted, and, as a consequence, where value will increasingly be created. We call this a transition from the marketplace
                                 to the marketspace. The transition is occurring at three levels of economic activity. The first is products and services,
                                 which will be reshaped to accommodate a marketspace whose salient characteristic is that it is information-based. The second
                                 level is marketing management systems. The third level is the markets themselves, affected as a consequence of the changes
                                 at the first two levels. Ultimately, we believe, the marketspace will supplant the marketplace for the simple reason that
                                 it will prove to be a more effective means of responding to customer needs and executing related transactions. Since we believe
                                 that it is inevitable, our purpose here is to chart the territory and encourage managers to venture forth

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREE Commerceby Rayport, Jeffrey F./ Jaworski, Bernard J.Once every decade a book comes along that becomes the standard in a field of study, the indispensable reference that every thoughtful practitioner must have on the shelf. Like Samuelson in Economics, Drucker in Management, and Porter in Strategy, Rayport and Jaworski have written what leaders in the New Economy are calling the standard in e-commerce strategy formulation.         > Finally someone has put it all together! These leading thinkers have put in one place a brilliant and comprehensive framework for thinking through, planning, teaching and managing e-Business. And   beyond that   this book is a portal to a stream of the most complete set of online, video, and other resources for e-Business learning to date. Great insights. Powerful tools.  Ralph Oliva, Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of Business Markets and Professor of Marketing, Pennsylvania State University>  < e-Commerce is the first textbook to show how firms gain competitive advantage in the New Economy. The authors introduce a number of new and innovative concepts, frameworks, and tools that benefit both students and managers. This book is destined to become the standard New Economy text in leading MBA programs.  John Quelch, Dean, London Business School>  < This is a wonderfully designed pedagogical device. The chapters build foundationally, so as to empower the student to deal with unique New Economy concepts, like the DCF approach to valuation etc., towards the end. The chapters are filled with case vignettes, viewpoints, and thought bytes that draws the self-selected reader in, and engages them in a sophisticated debate regarding the Internet economy. The highlight of the book, for me, was the way linkages were provided to existing management concepts. Thus the reader is not left wondering what the connection to the old paradigm is, in fact the reader gets a working dose of those ideas in the book chapters. This makes the book a stand-alone, comprehensive text with a cutting-edge tone and content.  Kastori Rangan, Eliot I. Snider and Family Professor of Business Administration Harvard Business School>Electronic CommerceCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Career[edit]
Rayport is a currently a member of the faculty in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at Harvard Business School. He is an authority on information-intensive industries such as media and entertainment, retail, and financial services. Prior to re-joining the HBS faculty, he founded or co-founded businesses in digital strategy and advisory services, executive development, e-learning, and software simulation, while he served as a senior partner at Monitor Deloitte.
He has published a series of MBA-level textbooks on e-Commerce and a bestselling business book on integrating multi-channel customer experiences.[1] In 1996, his Fast Company article "The Virus of Marketing"[2] introduced the concept of, and coined the term, "viral marketing."
Previously a faculty member at Harvard Business School, where he was voted outstanding professor in 1997, 1998 and 1999.[3] At HBS, Rayport developed and taught the first graduate-level e-commerce course in the United States, "Managing Marketspace Businesses" in 1995.[3] Business plans produced by Rayport's students resulted in various high-tech start-ups, including Yahoo! [3]
Rayport earned an A.B. from Harvard College, an M.Phil. in International Relations at the University of Cambridge (U.K.), and an A.M. and Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization at Harvard University.[4] He was the John Harvard Scholar at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge.
He has served as a director of several public and private corporations; current directorships include Andrews McMeel Universal, GSI Commerce (NASDAQ:GSIC), International Data Group, Conversant (part of Alliance Data), MediaMath, Monster Worldwide (NYSE:MWW), and ShopRunner. He also serves on the advisory boards of advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky and public relations firms FleishmanHillard and Brodeur Partners (both units of Omnicom Group; NYSE: OMC). In addition, he is a trustee of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA; a director of the Nantucket Preservation Trust in Nantucket, MA; and chairman of the board at From the Top (a classical music program distributed in the United States by National Public Radio) in Boston, MA.
e-Commerce[edit]
In his 2000 book e-Commerce, with Bernard Jaworski, Rayport formulates a set of design principles for e-Commerce websites, called the "7 C's":[5]

Context: Site's layout and design
Content: Text, pictures, sound and video, that the web pages contain
Community: The ways sites enable user to user communication
Customization: Site's ability to self-tailor to different users or to allow users to personalize the site
Communication: The ways sites enable site-to-user communication or two way communication
Connection: Degree site is linked to other sites.
Commerce: Site's capabilities to enable commercial transaction

Customization: Site's ability to self-tailor to different users or to allow users to personalize the site
Communication: The ways sites enable site-to-user communication or two way communication
Connection: Degree site is linked to other sites.
Commerce: Site's capabilities to enable commercial transaction

About the Book
+
-

   Once every decade a book comes along that becomes the standard in a field of study, the indispensable reference that every thoughtful practitioner must have on the shelf. Like Samuelson in Economics, Drucker in Management, and Porter in Strategy, Rayport and Jaworski have written what leaders in the New Economy are calling the standard in e-commerce strategy formulation. e-Commerce presents managers and strategists with road-tested frameworks for competing in the New Economy. This presentation is organized to facilitate the decision-making process for formulating e-commerce enterprise strategy. The text progresses from framing market opportunities to a discussion of New Economy business models, customer interfaces, and communication and branding issues through to implementation, evaluation, and valuation of the online enterprise. The textbook and companion casebook, E-Commerce and Cases in E-Commerce, are the first volumes produced for the McGraw-Hill/MarketspaceU learning series on e-commerce. McGraw-Hill/MarketspaceU have formed an alliance to develop and deliver exceptional higher education teaching materials on the latest business practices and theories by leading thinkers in the field of e-commerce. McGraw-Hill/MarketspaceU aim to equip present and future executives, managers, and strategists in becoming successful creators of value in the new economy. To accomplish this goal the alliance offers a multi-media suite of cutting-edge tools to help navigate the world of e-commerce. These tools include E-Commerce and Cases in E-Commerce, MarketspaceU.com, the McGraw-Hill Online Learning Center (OLC), and the McGraw-Hill E-Business Power Web. MarketspaceU is part of Marketspace, a Monitor Group company. Monitor Group is a family of professional services firms linked by shared ownership, management philosophy and assets. Monitor's roots can be traced back to the Harvard Business School - where a number of its founders studied and taught in the 1980s. Marketspace was founded in 1998. Jeffrey Rayport and Bernie Jaworski (two of its founders) are the principal authors of the first books produced by the McGraw-Hill/MarketspaceU alliance. e-Commerce has already received early critical acclaim from academic and Internet business leaders: "Rayport and Jaworski have defined the 'space'. e-Commerce is a primary weapon in the e-business frontier. Do not let your competitors read this book--buy every copy..." Jeff Taylor, Founder and CEO, Monster.com "Finally someone has put it all together  These leading thinkers have put in one place a brilliant and comprehensive framework for thinking through, planning, teaching and managing e-Business. And - beyond that - this book is a portal to a stream of the most complete set of online, video, and other resources for e-Business learning to date. Great insights. Powerful tools." Ralph Oliva, Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of Business Markets and Professor of Marketing, Pennsylvania State University "e-Commerce is the first textbook to show how firms gain competitive advantage in the New Economy. The authors introduce a number of new and innovative concepts, frameworks, and tools that benefit both students and managers. This book is destined to become the standard New Economy text in leading MBA programs." John Quelch, Dean, London Business School "This is a wonderfully designed pedagogical device.The chapters build foundationally, so as to empower the student to deal with unique New Economy concepts, like the DCF approach to valuation etc., towards the end. The chapters are filled with case vignettes, viewpoints, and thought bytes that draws the self-selected reader in, and engages them in a sophisticated debate regarding the Internet economy. The highlight of the book, for me, was the way linkages were provided to existing management concepts. Thus the reader is not left wondering what the connection to the old paradigm is, in fact the reader gets a working dose of those ideas in the book chapters. This makes the book a stand-alone, comprehensive text with a cutting-edge tone and content." Kastori Rangan, Eliot I. Snider and Family Professor of Business Administration Harvard Business School

Career[edit]
Rayport is a currently a member of the faculty in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at Harvard Business School. He is an authority on information-intensive industries such as media and entertainment, retail, and financial services. Prior to re-joining the HBS faculty, he founded or co-founded businesses in digital strategy and advisory services, executive development, e-learning, and software simulation, while he served as a senior partner at Monitor Deloitte.
He has published a series of MBA-level textbooks on e-Commerce and a bestselling business book on integrating multi-channel customer experiences.[1] In 1996, his Fast Company article "The Virus of Marketing"[2] introduced the concept of, and coined the term, "viral marketing."
Previously a faculty member at Harvard Business School, where he was voted outstanding professor in 1997, 1998 and 1999.[3] At HBS, Rayport developed and taught the first graduate-level e-commerce course in the United States, "Managing Marketspace Businesses" in 1995.[3] Business plans produced by Rayport's students resulted in various high-tech start-ups, including Yahoo! [3]
Rayport earned an A.B. from Harvard College, an M.Phil. in International Relations at the University of Cambridge (U.K.), and an A.M. and Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization at Harvard University.[4] He was the John Harvard Scholar at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge.
He has served as a director of several public and private corporations; current directorships include Andrews McMeel Universal, GSI Commerce (NASDAQ:GSIC), International Data Group, Conversant (part of Alliance Data), MediaMath, Monster Worldwide (NYSE:MWW), and ShopRunner. He also serves on the advisory boards of advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky and public relations firms FleishmanHillard and Brodeur Partners (both units of Omnicom Group; NYSE: OMC). In addition, he is a trustee of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA; a director of the Nantucket Preservation Trust in Nantucket, MA; and chairman of the board at From the Top (a classical music program distributed in the United States by National Public Radio) in Boston, MA.
e-Commerce[edit]
In his 2000 book e-Commerce, with Bernard Jaworski, Rayport formulates a set of design principles for e-Commerce websites, called the "7 C's":[5]

Context: Site's layout and design
Content: Text, pictures, sound and video, that the web pages contain
Community: The ways sites enable user to user communication
Customization: Site's ability to self-tailor to different users or to allow users to personalize the site
Communication: The ways sites enable site-to-user communication or two way communication
Connection: Degree site is linked to other sites.
Commerce: Site's capabilities to enable commercial transaction
