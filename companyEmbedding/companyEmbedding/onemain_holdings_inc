Scott+Scott, 
      Attorneys at Law, LLP (“Scott+Scott”), a national shareholder and 
      consumer rights litigation firm, reminds investors that it is 
      investigating OneMain Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:OMF) (“OneMain” or the 
      “Company”) to determine whether OneMain’s officers and directors 
      breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company and its 
      shareholders. If you are a current OneMain shareholder, you are 
      encouraged to contact Scott+Scott for additional information.
    

      OneMain is a consumer finance company that provides consumer finance and 
      insurance products and services as well as personal loans secured by 
      consumer household goods, and other personal property, unsecured loans, 
      and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages. In 
      November 2015, OneMain announced that it would be merging with 
      Springleaf Holdings, Inc. (“Springleaf”), after obtaining approval from 
      the Department of Justice. OneMain subsequently touted in press releases 
      and in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) 
      the projected net income to be achieved by the Company following, and in 
      large part due to, the combination of OneMain Financial with Springleaf, 
      and the purported synergies achieved by the combined company.
    

      On November 7, 2016, the Company drastically lowered its guidance for 
      its consumer insurance adjusted EPS and its receivables growth for 2016 
      and 2017. On this news, shares of OneMain common stock plummeted 
      approximately 38%, from $27.57 on November 7, 2016, to $16.90 on 
      November 8, 2016.
    

What You Can Do


      If you are a current OneMain shareholder, you may have legal claims 
      against OneMain’s officers and directors. If you wish to discuss this 
      investigation, or have questions about this notice or your legal rights, 
      please contact attorney Joe Pettigrew at (844) 818-6982, or at jpettigrew@scott-scott.com.
