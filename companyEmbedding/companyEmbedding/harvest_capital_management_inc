Wealth and investment management

Harvest Capital specializes in wealth and investment management services, business transition planning, and for those who have achieved significant wealth, we offer family office services. We are a privately-owned firm that believes in promoting family continuity, educating family members about financial matters, and managing the “business of the family,” while protecting and growing assets.
We help people attain life goals, as well as financial objectives – while maintaining a sustained, comfortable lifestyle for you and your loved ones.
We help you write  the next chapter in your life’s story.






You are the main character

Ten years ago, where you thought you'd be today may be a far cry from where you are, or you may be precisely on target. The point is, all narratives evolve in their own unique way. No two are the same.
Yours may comprise a large cast of characters – spouse, family and close friends, business partners – and include many plot twists and turns. You may be the leader of a family business, the beneficiary of an estate, or a corporate executive. We recognize that your history, your goals and dreams for the future, are unique and personal, and because we are independent, we are free to help write the story that truly reflects your goals.










As your story evolves, things change



Planning
Transitions
Enjoyment

Perhaps your grandparents founded a business and passed it to your parents, who later transitioned it to you.  You’ve grown the business and achieved success, and now you’re considering what’s next.  Our team of professionals has the expertise to help you confidently transition your business and turn the page to your next adventure.
Or maybe you’ve reached the point in life where your children have graduated and married. You delight in your grandchildren, and begin to imagine life in retirement. How will you share your hard-earned wealth with your family, and who will you trust to manage it to realize the life you envision?
Perhaps you’ve inherited wealth from a loved one, and you’re not sure what to do. Your dream is to live comfortably, travel and support in a meaningful way the causes that you are passionate about. We understand. We’re passionate, too – about helping our clients define and reach their goals, about our team and our families, and about our community.

Regardless of the catalyst that led you to us, we listen closely to understand how you define success and create a financial strategy to help you flourish financially as you continue life’s adventure.






Every family experiences milestones

Many are anticipated and joyous, some are not. Planning is essential, but discussing family matters can be daunting to even the most harmonious family because money and emotions go hand-in-hand. 
Harvest Capital helps you navigate the ‘human’ side of wealth management. Family relationships are at the core of financial goal-setting, and clients turn to us as trusted advisors to craft strategies around their common family values and goals.























You've "arrived"

And Harvest Capital can help you write the next chapter in your life story.
We offer conflict-free wealth management and family office services to discerning clients throughout the country, and help business owners transition their companies to the next generation or third parties.  But more than that, we invest in your family – we learn who you are, what your financial goals and life dreams are. Our relationship helps you prosper as your life story unfolds.








	                			Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.
	                			


—Benjamin Franklin

My family, both my wife and children and those who came before me, help define who I am.  I come from a long history of entrepreneurs and business owners.  Most important were my many grandfathers in Gloucester who supported America’s fishing industry.  One fought in the battle of Bunker Hill and one was a Privateer in the War of 1812.  Their descendants operated a chandlery and also a sail loft in Gloucester.  My great grandfather’s business made the sails for the largest pure sailing vessel ever built (in 1902).  His son, my grandfather, graduated from MIT in 1906 as an electrochemical engineer and worked for Edison before starting his own commercial lighting business in Boston during the early 20th century. My father was a naval architect and marine engineer from MIT who helped design and build the SS United States, the largest and fastest passenger ship built in the U.S.  I am proud to have founded a successful business that delivers important value to our client families and carries forward my family’s entrepreneurial tradition.

Director, Client Services
JaneBates
1999


Jane has worked in the trust/investment business for 36 years, nearly half of them with Harvest Capital.  She oversees client account set up, funding and administration; trust coordination; investment asset and money transfers; tax reporting; retirement account distributions; and client communications.  Prior to joining Harvest, Jane worked at First NH Investment Services (now Citizens Bank) as an Assistant Trust Operations Officer.
























Areas of expertise

Jane’s early professional experience was more focused on back-office operations, but with Harvest she has embraced a critical, client-facing role and is instrumental in providing our clients with exceptional, personal service. 
 
Family / Hobbies / Interests

The youngest of four, three older brothers; married to John for 37 years; and has a dog named Hannah. She loves baking, hiking, camping, travel and geocaching.  Jane likes to read all kinds of books but thinks “Unbroken,” by Laura Hillenbrand, is “pretty amazing.”  

On success

For me: Success is being happy, and, most importantly, healthy (hopefully), enjoying friends and family, and every day. And I hope to retire one day and travel!
For our clients: Everyone is different. Our clients care about their money, of course, and are thankful to have the means to live comfortably  but just like me, most just want to enjoy life, and I am happy to help them do so! 

Favorite childhood memory

The most fun memories were when I was fairly young, six to eight years old.  We had a camp on Camp Island on Lake Winnipesaukee and we always had fun up there; we fished and of course did a lot of swimming and boating.  My father built boats so we never knew what we would be riding in.
My father also converted a bus (think Greyhound, not school) into basically an RV; it had everything we needed; we took that to Florida several times and up to the 1967 World’s Fair/Expo in Canada among many other places. Worked great for traveling with four kids!

My family is big on skiing. In winter, we would travel from Massachusetts to Franconia, NH every Friday night so we could spend the weekend skiing at Cannon Mountain. There was always that one Sunday in winter when a big storm would come through, and the forecast for the next day was just so promising that we would stay the extra day, play hooky from school, and ski to our hearts’ content. The only thing better than a great ski day, was a great ski day when I was supposed to be in school. Those special family ski days are my favorite childhood memory!

Business Transition Planning
Every business owner faces the challenge: take control of your business transition, or let other forces control the outcome.



Scroll to Learn more












You are the main character

Running your business is second nature to you– the central plot in your life’s story. You are the main character, and it may be difficult to envision someone else taking your place. But planning for the eventual transition of your business and for life after the business – your next chapter – is the culminating achievement of your career.
Harvest Capital can guide the successful transition of a family business to new owners and management, from within the family or the outside, and develop a financial strategy to help outgoing owners sustain a lifestyle to which they are accustomed. 








Helping families navigate the "human side" of transition

Preparing to transition a family business is everyone’s business; participation and input from the entire family is essential. For many families, this is the most intimidating aspect of the entire process. Our team specializes in helping families navigate the “human side” of transition. We facilitate family meetings in which all members of the family have an opportunity to share their thoughts, concerns and ideas for the transition and a family vision for the future.  When family members have opposing views, we help them identify mutual interests on which they can agree, and a common, united way forward.
We’ve made it a bit easier to understand by writing a whitepaper titled "Family Business Transition Planning". We invite you to download the PDF here





We bring your entire team together
Whether the transition involves transfer to a new generation of family members or sale to a third party, we access the full capabilities of our network of professional advisors to define and carry out the decisions necessary to balance both family and business transition goals. We bring your entire team – family, colleagues, advisors, other professionals – together to work toward common goals.
Together, we outline the plot and draft the narrative for your family’s future.

Family values

My family, both my wife and children and those who came before me, help define who I am.  I come from a long history of entrepreneurs and business owners.  Most important were my many grandfathers in Gloucester who supported America’s fishing industry.  One fought in the battle of Bunker Hill and one was a Privateer in the War of 1812.  Their descendants operated a chandlery and also a sail loft in Gloucester.  My great grandfather’s business made the sails for the largest pure sailing vessel ever built (in 1902).  His son, my grandfather, graduated from MIT in 1906 as an electrochemical engineer and worked for Edison before starting his own commercial lighting business in Boston during the early 20th century. My father was a naval architect and marine engineer from MIT who helped design and build the SS United States, the largest and fastest passenger ship built in the U.S.  I am proud to have founded a successful business that delivers important value to our client families and carries forward my family’s entrepreneurial tradition.

Director, Client Services
JaneBates
1999


Jane has worked in the trust/investment business for 36 years, nearly half of them with Harvest Capital.  She oversees client account set up, funding and administration; trust coordination; investment asset and money transfers; tax reporting; retirement account distributions; and client communications.  Prior to joining Harvest, Jane worked at First NH Investment Services (now Citizens Bank) as an Assistant Trust Operations Officer.
























Areas of expertise

Jane’s early professional experience was more focused on back-office operations, but with Harvest she has embraced a critical, client-facing role and is instrumental in providing our clients with exceptional, personal service. 
 
Family / Hobbies / Interests

The youngest of four, three older brothers; married to John for 37 years; and has a dog named Hannah. She loves baking, hiking, camping, travel and geocaching.  Jane likes to read all kinds of books but thinks “Unbroken,” by Laura Hillenbrand, is “pretty amazing.”  

On success

For me: Success is being happy, and, most importantly, healthy (hopefully), enjoying friends and family, and every day. And I hope to retire one day and travel!
For our clients: Everyone is different. Our clients care about their money, of course, and are thankful to have the means to live comfortably  but just like me, most just want to enjoy life, and I am happy to help them do so! 

Favorite childhood memory

The most fun memories were when I was fairly young, six to eight years old.  We had a camp on Camp Island on Lake Winnipesaukee and we always had fun up there; we fished and of course did a lot of swimming and boating.  My father built boats so we never knew what we would be riding in.
My father also converted a bus (think Greyhound, not school) into basically an RV; it had everything we needed; we took that to Florida several times and up to the 1967 World’s Fair/Expo in Canada among many other places. Worked great for traveling with four kids!

The youngest of two – one older sister; married to DJ who is a web designer, for 13 years; two children – Micah and Mahalie.  Loves spending time outdoors with her family and their canine companion, running, mountain biking, hiking and skiing. Sarah’s all-time favorite book is “Where the Sidewalk Ends,” by Shel Silverstein, and her favorite author is Bill Bryson whose “A Walk in the Woods” and “The Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid” are among her favorites.  

Favorite childhood memory

My family is big on skiing. In winter, we would travel from Massachusetts to Franconia, NH every Friday night so we could spend the weekend skiing at Cannon Mountain. There was always that one Sunday in winter when a big storm would come through, and the forecast for the next day was just so promising that we would stay the extra day, play hooky from school, and ski to our hearts’ content. The only thing better than a great ski day, was a great ski day when I was supposed to be in school. Those special family ski days are my favorite childhood memory!

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Investment Management Strategy









A Common Sense Investment Philosophy
Depending on where you look for guidance in directing your investment strategy, it's likely that you'll find one of the following philosophies:
 High risk: Competing in the market - betting that at some point the market will offer you more for your assets than you paid, thereby achieving a payoff.
 Technical Analysis: Hoping that past performance can indicate future performance. 
Your assets are too important to gamble with. You want a partner that takes a common sense approach to managing your investments. Harvest Capital Advisors focuses on  fundamental investment strategies in the earnings.
With an eye toward generating return for you, your Harvest Capital team looks for the following:
 Great companies
Growth industries/sectors
Strong historical and projected future earnings growth
 Low debt
Proven management
Companies who produce multiple products
Barriers to competitive entry
Stock prices that aren't inflated by "irrational exuberance"

Our four point approach to managing your investments ensures that your interests come first. Our goals are to:
 Preserve your assets.
Help you create the income you need to achieve your financial goals (and a few dreams).
Position your assets for reasonable and sustainable growth.
Actively monitor your portfolio so that you don't face unnecessary risk and can maximize performance - for the long term.
