GH Solutions has the breakthrough process that the nutraceutical, functional beverage, and health food markets have been waiting for. As the exclusive licensee of US patent 6080401, we are the sole source of a method that supercharges the benefits of botanicals like hemp seed oil with the incredible health effects of probiotics. Working with us, manufacturers can finally integrate probiotic-enhanced botanicals into their health and wellness products.
Using our molecular probiotic formula, the body absorbs hemp oil more quickly and effectively. Our method— licensed from one of the world’s leading probiotic researchers—positions clients to develop custom probiotic-fueled botanical formulations to add to their nutritional supplements, foods, and beverages.
Partnering with GH Solutions is the pathway to developing products that offer the therapeutic benefits of hemp oil and probiotics synergistically, in a new, more effective way.

 ("GH Solutions") a company focused on creating and offering nutritional products with hemp supplements, today announced the company's KOIOS Raspberry Wonder with Hemp beverage is now available in stores nationwide for immediate purchase.


                                        








"KOIOS Raspberry Wonder is a combination of nature and science," stated John George Michak III, COO of GH Solutions. "The beverage industry is going through major shifts right now, with the majority of consumers looking for beverages that are not only organic and use wholesome ingredients, but also have added functionality," he continued. "Consumers are also willing to pay a premium for these new beverages, which allows us to make a very high quality product for this market," Mr. Michak concluded.


                                        








The drink will be available for purchase through two of Koios' biggest distributors: Europa and WishingUWell. 


                                        








Europa is one of the largest distributors of sports nutrition products in the country. They service over 50,000 retail locations -- have 8 distribution centers and over 300 employees.


                                        








WishingUWell is one of the top portals on the internet for health and wellness. They are also one of Amazon's largest and most preferred partners. 


                                        








"KOIOS Raspberry Wonder is a beautiful combination of functionality and organic ingredients," said Chris Miller, CEO of KOIOS. "We use earth grown nootropics to create a product to stimulate brain function, endurance, focus, clarity and to create all day functionality with no stimulants," Chris continued. "KOIOS Raspberry Wonder uses Hemp because it is one of nature's great super foods. It is balanced with Omega 3's and Omega 6's; and it contains vitamins, minerals, healthy fats and protein. We believe that the addition of Hemp to this formulation may boost immunity, improve brain function and may help reduce cholesterol. KOIOS Raspberry Wonder is an innovative product and is the only nootropic/Hemp Oil infused beverage on the market," Chris concluded.

GH Solutions expects to issue additional updates in the future.


                                        








About GH Solutions (Greenhouse Solutions, Inc.)


                                        








GH Solutions is a science-based company focused on offering products to consumers within the burgeoning hemp health products industry. The Company has formulations that offer the benefits of botanicals like hemp seed oil in nutitional products for consumers, and plans future products incorporating a licensed probiotic application, when developed. We are in a joint venture with Koios LLC, which had its own formulaes for nutritional products, and we decided to combine hemp oil into the Koios formulations with new tastes for our Raspberry Wonder drink. GH Solutions encourages all current and prospective shareholders to visit our website at:         www.ghsolutionsinc.com
 or Greenhouse's Facebook page at         https://m.facebook.com/Greenhousesolutionsinc

The KOIOS product creators began developing their own nootropic formulas to combat ADHD and to eliminate harmful stimulants out of their lives. After several years of study, they formulated the initial KOIOS drink formulation. KOIOS encourages people to visit their website to learn more:

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Announces First Product in Their New Healthcare Line for Pain in Companion AnimalsMarketwiredFebruary 25, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareGREENWOOD VILLAGE, CO--(Marketwired - February 25, 2015) - Greenhouse Solutions Inc. (OTC PINK: GRSU) today announced their plans to manufacture, market and sell a proprietary product for the alleviation of pain in companion animals utilizing Cannabidiols (CBDs) and Probiotics. Greenhouse Solutions previously announced that they were creating products for both the personal health and companion pet markets utilizing a licensed probiotic delivery system (US Patent #6,080,401). Today's announcement marks the first product to be developed in the Company's new division that takes advantage of new research in CBD."I have been working with Dr. Reddy to formulate products that utilize the best aspects of the new research and licensed technologies," commented Rik J Deitsch, CEO of Greenhouse Solutions. "I'm very excited to get this first product underway as we create new paradigms with the use of Cannabidiols and probiotics for the wellness marketplace," he continued. "We know that the pain market in companion animals is large and mostly unmet. This will be a necessary product that will make a real difference for millions of pets," he concluded.According to The American Pet Products Association (APPA) there are 83 million dogs and 95 million cats in the US. These companion animals are as susceptible as humans to ailments that require pain-relieving solutions. The total market for companion animals in the US reached an estimated $58.5 billion in 2014. Of these expenditures, over $13 billion was spent on medication for the animals. Additionally, a 2009 survey conducted by Virbac Pharmaceuticals puts the annual US market for companion animal pain relievers at more than $250 million."Unlike the pain in the human beings, which he or she can communicate to get medication, the animals specifically , companion animals (dogs and cats) suffer thru the pain," Stated Dr. M.S Reddy. "Only person that can perceive the pain of the pet is the pet owner. Due to severe pain, the dogs and cats do not eat properly , do not rest and thus develop other serious complications such as, constipation, pruritis (severe itching of the anal area) and restlessness etc. etc," he continued. "This all natural patented approach of Green House Solutions using Cannabidiols (CBDs) and species specific Probiotics will alleviate the pain thru the synbiosis. In this particular preparation, Probiotics not only help the activation of the Cannabidiols to enhance the pain relieving property (even at a small dose) but also improve the overall Gastro Intestinal Health of the animals. These all natural products of Green House Solutions does not give any serious side effects (unlike the other Allopathic medicines), which will hurt the health of the companion animals," he concluded.Greenhouse Solutions expects the product to be finalized and sent to manufacturing within the first quarter with an expected launch in the second quarter of this year.About Greenhouse Solutions, Inc. Greenhouse Solutions operates three distinct business units within the burgeoning cannabis market: Greenhouse Solutions' Design & Consulting Service offers an all-inclusive solution to the expansion and efficiency of hydroponic and agricultural businesses nationwide. The Company is able to supply a comprehensive solution to the design, build, implementation, production, and expansion of all variations of indoor, outdoor and greenhouse agricultural business; Greenhouse Solutions' Product Development develops, markets, produces and sells cannabidiol ("CBD") products for both the personal health and companion pet markets utilizing a licensed probiotic delivery system (US Patent #6,080,401) and other licensed formulas.
