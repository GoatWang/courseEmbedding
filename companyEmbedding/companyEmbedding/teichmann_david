ARTISAN STARTUP STORIES 


								STARTUP STORY: SAN FRANOLA GRANOLA							

April 23, 2014
1 Comment



 



San Franola Granola‘s recipe is simple: They use a proprietary roasting technique that gives their granola a robust flavor and those giant clusters we all love. This technique also allows them to use natural ingredients like almonds, cinnamon, and ginger to flavor their granolas, resulting in less sugar and 10 grams of protein per serving.
Co-founders Matt Teichmann & David Miskie started San Franola in 2010.  Dave’s Dad, who spent 12 years developing his own granola recipe in an effort to improve his health, inspired Matt and Dave to quit their corporate jobs and build a brand that will bring a healthy crunch to snacking.

They’re currently serving up 5 flavors of granola:

California Raisin
Cinnamon Almond
Ginger Snap
Lemon Zest
Toasted Chia

Think granola is just for breakfast? Think again. In addition to the traditional 12 oz Multi-Serve bag, San Franola comes in 1.55 oz Single Serve Boxes, making their granola perfect as an all-day snack on the go, too.  Here’s their creative twist on a green smoothie: The San Franola Kale + Peanut Butter Smoothie

SO HOW DID THEY DO IT?
Who are the business founders and when did you launch the business?
Matt Teichmann and David Miskie started San Franola Granola in 2010
What inspired you to start your business?
All stories have a hero. In this case, it was Dave’s Dad. After being diagnosed with pre diabetes, he spent 12 years tinkering with and perfecting his own granola recipe. Granola was previously one of the many “healthy” foods he had been eating which in fact had been laden with sugars and fats. His transformation inspired Matt & Dave to build a brand around healthy snacking.
Did you have a background in the food/drink industry when you started?
Nope – Matt worked in web startups, and David in private equity. But, as lifelong athletes, they started the business understanding the positive impact eating well has on the body – both mentally and physically.
How do you stay motivated in the face of competition?
We’re inspired by all the amazing health & wellness brands we see every day. Learning more about what other companies are doing motivates us to keep improving.
Whats your main business goal for 2014?
This year is all about growth. We launched 5 new flavors in January, and we’ll be rolling out with retailers nationwide and internationally!
Where do you see your business in 10 years?
We want to be a healthy solution for people looking for a delicious snack that doesn’t compromise on flavor, texture, or quality. Our goal is to develop product lines and flavors that reach as many eaters as possible.
Your dream celebrity endorsement?
Jeremy Lin – he’s cool, he’s smart, and he could definitely use some San Franola in his training regimen!
What’s your team or company motto?
“Good food, without compromise”
