(HDGE) Ranger Equity Bear ETF


Overview


How HDGE Works
The investment objective of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (NYSE Arca: HDGE) is capital appreciation through short sales of domestically traded equity securities.  HDGE is sub-advised by Ranger Alternative Management, L.P. ("Portfolio Manager"). The Portfolio Manager implements a bottom-up, fundamental, research driven security selection process. In selecting short positions, the Fund seeks to identify securities with low earnings quality or aggressive accounting which may be intended on the part of company management to mask operational deterioration and bolster the reported earnings per share over a short time period. In addition, the Portfolio Manager seeks to identify earnings driven events that may act as a catalyst to the price decline of a security, such as downwards earnings revisions or reduced forward guidance.

Why Invest in HDGE

As a Tool to Hedge Equity Exposure - HDGE can be used as part of a long/short strategy in which an investor may synthetically integrate by pairing HDGE with a long-index ETF (or an investor’s portfolio of long positions), providing the investor with a “buy and hold” option to hedge their long domestically-traded equity exposure.
For Diversified Portfolio Construction - The Portfolio Manager's portfolio construction process emphasizes diversification across a number of industries and specific companies with a special focus on catalysts that drive lower stock returns.  The portfolio typically consists of between 20-75 equity short positions, with an average position size of between 2% and 7% of the portfolio exposure.
For a Fundamental Investment Process - The Portfolio Manager utilizes accounting metrics across the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet to identify companies with low earnings quality or possible aggressive accounting practices. These factors may suggest operational deterioration in a company’s business. Qualitative analysis is also considered. An assessment of the management team, accounting practices, corporate governance and the company's competitive advantage are analyzed before a company is included as part of the HDGE portfolio.


Key Attributes

Disciplined, Repeatable Investment Process - The forensic accounting based methodology the Portfolio Manager utilizes is a disciplined, consistent investment approach to both security selection and risk management. Like an investigative auditor, a forensic accountant dissects a company’s financial statements, crunching the numbers searching for evidence in the data that may suggest operational deterioration or manipulative sales and revenue recognition, rather than focusing on fad products or broken business models to identify domestically-traded equity stocks that are expected to underperform.
Experience - The Portfolio Manager has experience trading and managing short portfolios with the ability to tactically allocate to liquid, low short interest stocks of companies which may be masking operational deterioration.
Market Analysis - Top-down technical evaluation of broader market liquidity, sentiment and breadth is utilized to help identify short and intermediate term market trends, manage exposure and mitigate risk.
Specialized Strategy - Effectively shorting individual securities requires an approach very different from a traditional long-only strategy.  HDGE is a very specialized product managed by investment professionals with years of short selling experience as opposed to another fund that might not have the HDGE ETF Product Manager’s shorting expertise.

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested.  The Fund may invest in (or short) ETFs, ETNs and ETPs. In addition to the risks associated with such vehicles, investments, or reference assets in the case of ETNs, lack of liquidity can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio investment. Other Fund risks include market risk, equity risk, short sales and leverage risk, large cap risk, early closing risk, liquidity risk and trading risk.  Short sales involve leverage because the Fund borrows securities and then sells them, effectively leveraging its assets.  The use of leverage may magnify gains or losses for the Fund.  See prospectus for specific risks and details.
Downward earnings revisions is when an investment analyst or a company’s management revises their earnings projections for the company below the consensus estimate.  Reduced forward guidance is when a company’s management reduces previously disseminated earnings projections for an upcoming time period. Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole.
The NYSE Composite Index is designed to measure the performance of all common stocks listed on the NYSE, including ADRs, REITs and tracking stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a widely used indicator of the overall condition of the stock market, a price-weighted average of 30 actively traded blue chip stocks, primarily industrials.

Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost. Returns less than one year are not annualized.
The performance for periods before 07/01/16 is for the AdvisorShares TrimTabs Float Shrink ETF (the “Predecessor Fund”) which was renamed the AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF on 07/01/16. The Predecessor Fund had different portfolio managers and investment strategy than the Wilshire Buyback ETF. Performance prior to 07/01/16 reflects the Fund’s performance prior to the change in manager and investment strategy and may not be indicative of the Fund’s performance under the new manager and revised investment strategy. Performance since 07/01/16 reflects actual Wilshire Buyback ETF performance.

Why Invest in TTFS

For Core Diversification - Allocating to a buyback focused US Core strategy can further diversify your manager risk and potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. TTFS can provide an  alternative core allocation that may replace or complement market cap, fundamental, dividend or other index weighting methodologies you employ in your portfolio allocation.
To Achieve a Differentiated Approach to Harnessing Buyback Alpha - The Portfolio Manager’s approach to security selection and portfolio construction is unique relative to other buyback focused strategies, with the goal of delivering a differentiated portfolio and a lower correlation of excess returns (alpha) relative to its peers.
For a Potentially Higher Quality Equity Exposure - Companies that are able to buy back stock are generally on financially firmer footing than companies that do not have buyback programs in place.


Where can TTFS Fit in a Traditional Portfolio?

TTFS can provide an alternative core allocation that may replace or complement market cap,  fundamental, dividend or other index weighting methodologies you employ in your portfolio allocation.


5 Key Attributes

Supply/Demand Philosophy - The Portfolio Manager believes that the prices of stocks are influenced by supply and demand, and that stocks should perform best when their outstanding shares decrease. All else being equal, if the same amount of money is chasing a smaller number of shares, then the share price increases.
Quality Filtering - The Portfolio Manager invests in companies that are not increasing leverage and have positive free cash flow.
Buyback Strength-Based Weighting - Positions are sized based on Wilshire’s proprietary buyback strength signal, which is calculated based on a normalized measure of the reduction in
shares outstanding relative to other securities in the portfolio.
Extensive Stock Screening - The Portfolio Manager screens approximately 3,000
companies, narrows that universe to approximately 750 of the most liquid securities, and invests in approximately 100 stocks that have a reduction in outstanding shares, are not increasing leverage, and have positive free cash flow.
Innovative Research - Wilshire Associates has a history of innovation since its inception in 1972. The firm’s research team regularly reevaluates quantitative factors to continue to enhance
its investment solutions to adapt to evolving financial markets.

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested.  Investing in mid and small capitalization companies may be riskier and more volatile than large cap companies. Other Fund risks include market risk, equity risk, large cap risk, liquidity risk and trading risk. Please see prospectus for details regarding risk.
Alpha is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating," is calculated for managed products with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars, and the bottom 10% receive one star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three- and five-year Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns.

ETF Glossary


Actively Managed ETF
An actively managed ETF uses an active investment strategy to meet its investment objective. The investment strategy is not based on an index, however an actively managed ETF may have an index-based benchmark.  The investment strategy is based on the portfolio manager’s expertise and is described in the prospectus for the ETF.
After Tax Return
The return from an investment after all income taxes have been accounted for and deducted. The SEC has adopted a number of amendments requiring mutual funds to disclose standardized after-tax returns. The amendments require a disclosure of standardized after-tax returns for 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods in the risk/return summary of the prospectus.
Asset Class
Refers to the categorization of an asset. Examples of key asset classes include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, real estate, and cash.
Authorized Participants
This term typically refers to large financial institutions, such as specialist firms and market makers, which are involved in the creation and redemption activity of exchange-traded funds.
Benchmark
A standard index used for measuring the performance of an investment.  
Commissions
Investors purchasing ETF shares in the secondary market through a brokerage account or with the assistance of a broker or registered representative may be subject to brokerage commissions and charges
Creation Unit
The smallest block of ETF shares that can be bought or sold from the ETF at net asset value (NAV). Only Authorized Participants such as market makers or institutions can purchase or redeem shares directly from the Fund. All other investors can buy or sell ETF shares at the market price, over an exchange.   The creation unit size can vary by ETF and ranges from 25,000 to 600,000 shares.
Creations/Redemptions
The process by which Authorized Participants transact directly with the fund on an "in kind" basis. Creations/Redemptions occur in Creation Unit aggregations or multiples thereof and involve delivering a specified basket of securities to the fund in exchange for ETF shares and vice versa. Creations/Redemptions occur at the end-of-day Net Asset Value of the fund to avoid dilution of existing fund shares. Creations/Redemptions involve an "in kind" transfer of securities, a transaction that is not a taxable event for the fund. This allows imbalances between supply and demand for ETF shares to be satisfied without having an adverse taxable effect upon existing ETF shareholders.
Discount to NAV
Different than non-exchange traded mutual funds, which are bought and sold directly from the fund company at the NAV at the end of the day, ETFs trade at prices determined by the market forces of supply and demand. A fund that trades at a price less than its NAV is said to trade at a discount to its NAV.
ETF Administrator
The ETF Administrator is responsible for several activities for an ETF, including calculating the daily NAV, acting as transfer agent, and providing the reporting necessary for financial reporting and filings with the SEC.
ETF Custodian
Most ETFs have an independent third party custodian who is responsible for holding all of the securities in an ETF.  This role is segregated from the investment advisor and portfolio manager and provides an additional layer to help mitigate risks.
ETF Exchange Listings
Investors can purchase and sell shares on the secondary market through a broker. Secondary-market transactions occur at, above or below the ETF indicative NAV at market prices that change throughout the day, based on the supply and demand of Fund shares and on changes in the prices of the Fund’s portfolio holdings (see Indicative Value). The market price of shares can be different from the NAV of the Fund. 
Exchange-traded funds (ETF)
ETFs are open-ended registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which have received certain exemptive relief from the SEC to allow secondary market trading in the ETF shares.
Exchange Traded Note
ETNs are debt securities and are linked to stock, bond, currency, or commodity indexes. Investors that keep their ETN to maturity receive a cash payment calculated from the beginning trade date to the maturity date. Applicable fees are deducted and can reduce the value of the payment. ETNs can also be sold before maturity on the exchange where they trade or they can be redeemed in large blocks. ETNs carry issuer credit risk and another risk is taxation as the IRS could change the tax rules affecting ETNs.
Expense ratio 
The annual fee that all funds  and/or ETFs charge their shareholders.  The fee is usually expressed as a percentage of the fund's average daily net assets. This ratio includes the management fee, trustee's fee, index license fee, and 12b-1 fee, among others. It does not include the commissions you pay to buy and sell ETF shares, or the costs incurred by the fund in trading its securities.
FINRA
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), is the largest non-governmental regulator for securities firms doing business in the United States and is dedicated to investor protection through regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services.
Fund of  Funds or ETF of ETFs
A fund seeking to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in other funds or exchange-traded funds.
Indicative Value
A measure of the intraday net asset value (NAV) of the exchange-traded fund (ETF), which gives an updated measure of the value of the investment based on its assets less its liabilities. An investment's NAV is usually calculated at the end of the trading day, but the indicative NAV measure gives a more real-time view of this value. Note that indicative NAV is not the price at which you can purchase the instrument; it is only used as a reference for the investment's underlying value. In many cases, the ETF may trade at a premium or discount to the NAV due to various factors such as supply and demand, and expectations.  The symbol for most indicative values is the ETF ticker symbol with an “.IV” (ETF.IV) 
Investment Style
Indicates the approach of an investment manager in selecting securities. For example, a certain manager may be value oriented, whereas another may emphasize growth.
Lead Market Maker
Lead market makers are firms responsible for providing continuous, two-sided markets and liquidity.
Liquidity
Ability to rapidly buy or sell an asset without substantially affecting the asset's price. Liquidity also refers to the relative ease with which an asset can be converted into cash.
Market capitalization
Total value of a company. Total number of shares multiplied by the price of a share.
Market Return
The total return of an ETF based on its market price at the beginning and end of the holding period. 
Market Price
The market price of an ETF is the price at which it can be bought or sold.  This price is mostly determined by an indicative value that is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout the day.  It can be affected by the market forces of supply and demand.
Net Asset Value
Or NAV is the value of each share of a fund as determined by the value of its underlying holdings, including any cash in the portfolio. NAV is calculated by dividing a fund's total net assets by its number of shares outstanding. Shares in ETFs (with the exception of creation units) are bought and sold at the market price, which can differ from NAV.  In calculating NAV, a Fund generally values its investment portfolio at market price.
Net Asset Value (NAV)  Return
The total return of an ETF based on its NAV at the beginning and end of the holding period. 
Premium to NAV
Unlike regular mutual funds, which are bought and sold directly from the fund company at the net asset value of their portfolio securities, ETFs trade at prices determined by the market forces of supply and demand. A fund that trades at a price higher than  its NAV is said to trade at a premium to  its NAV.
Prospectus
Required by securities laws and issued by mutual fund companies and ETFs, the prospectus is a legal document that discloses the investment objectives of the fund, operating history, fund management, management fees, portfolio holdings, and other related financial data. Brokers are required to give a prospectus to investors before they invest in an ETF.
Risks
Principal risks that may affect ETFs include but are not limited to liquidity risks, trading risks, early close risk, fund of funds risk, underlying ETF risk, equity risk, fixed income risk, foreign currency risk, and/or foreign securities risk.  Risks are typically disclosed in the fund’s prospectus.
Securities & Exchange Commission
Federal agency that regulates U.S. financial markets, also known as SEC.
Transaction Fees
These are fees to offset the fund’s transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units of shares.  These are disclosed  in the fund’s prospectus.
Transparency
An ETF whose holdings are disclosed daily after the close of trading on the listing Exchange and prior to the opening of trading on the Exchange the following day.
Ticker
The lettering system used to identify a stock, mutual fund, or ETF on an exchange. Every ETF has one.
Total Net Assets
Indicates the total amount of assets, including cash, that a fund holds as of a certain date.

ETF History


ETFs were first introduced in the early 1990s in the United States and Canada and over the ensuing years the number of ETFs traded worldwide and the value of their assets under management have increased substantially. 
ETFs are now a global product tracking the performance of broad-based equity indices, sector specific indexes and other asset classes such as fixed income, metals and commodities. 
Actively managed ETFs are new investment vehicles that will allow investors to participate in an actively managed portfolio strategy that could range from tactical to traditional asset allocation and from sophisticated currency strategies to emerging markets.

History[edit]
The firm launched its first active ETF fund in 2009.[2] By 2014 it had 24 active ETFs and $1.83 billion under management.[3] AdvisorShares is a subsidiary of Fund.com, which has a 60% ownership interest.[4]
AdvisorShares partners with third party financial advisers who already manage clients’ assets to package their investment strategy using exchange-traded funds. As part of promoting its funds it also provides educational support to help financial advisors and investors understand actively managed ETFs and their underlying investment strategies.[5][6]
In October 2012 Esposito Securities LLC sued AdvisorShares, claiming that the parties signed a mutual nondisclosure agreement and that subsequently Dan Ahrens, an officer of AdvisorShares, began sharing confidential information with Esposito's clients and told them not to do business with Esposito.[7]
Funds[edit]
The DENT Tactical ETF[edit]
The Dent Tactical ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 15, 2009 under the NYSE: DENT. The first product of AdvisorShares Investments, LLC, DENT was actively managed by HS Dent Investment Management, LLC, an independent economic research and forecasting company and publisher of The Dent Method.[8]
HS Dent Investment Management was managed by financial author, Harry S. Dent Jr. Previously, HS Dent had raised and managed a $2.0 billion mutual fund, AIM Dent Demographic Trends, which was merged into another fund after it lost 80% of its assets.[9] According to Morningstar, Inc., DENT had highest expense ratio among ETFs, 1.5% of assets, as of July 2011.[10]
DENT closed in August 2012.[11] Its last day of trading was August 8, 2012 and remaining investments were returned to shareholders on August 15, 2012.[12]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF (NYSE symbol: GRV)[edit]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 9, 2010 under the NYSE Ticker: GRV and was managed by Mars Hill Partners, LLC. GRV was the industry's first actively managed long/short ETF.[13]
While GRV managed to raise $38 million a month after it launched, investors fled until the fund had only $3.2 million left. On December 1, 2011, Accuvest Global Advisors took over management of the fund and changed the name and ticker to AdvisorShares Accuvest Global Long Short ETF (AGLS).[13]
The Global Echo ETF (NYSE Symbol: GIVE) and partnership with Philippe Cousteau Jr.[edit]
In May 2012, AdvisorShares launched the AdvisorShares Global Echo ETF on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: GIVE focused on sustainable investing; the fund also said it would donate a portion of the fund expense fees to Global Echo Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by Philippe Cousteau, Jr. focused on social issues impacting women and children to environmental conservation, as well as supporting social entrepreneurship.[14] The fund's expense ratio is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off.[15]

In May 2012, AdvisorShares launched the AdvisorShares Global Echo ETF on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: GIVE focused on sustainable investing; the fund also said it would donate a portion of the fund expense fees to Global Echo Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by Philippe Cousteau, Jr. focused on social issues impacting women and children to environmental conservation, as well as supporting social entrepreneurship.[14] The fund's expense ratio is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off.[15]

AdvisorShares Trust(NYSE:HDGE): In Focus As Equities Pull Back | ETF Daily News

































 





























































Bearish Funds In Focus As Equities Finally Pull Back


 May 17, 2017 12:59pm  NYSE:HDGE  



 




Bearish days in the market, which are far and few in between these days, remind us of Actively Managed “Bear” ETFs in the marketplace that tend to shine during such periods.




We have profiled HDGE (AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear, Expense Ratio 1.75%, $176 million in AUM) in the past in this column, with the fund having debuted back in early 2011, and the ETF is substantially off of its early 2016 highs where we see it trading at high as $13.19 (it has a $9 handle currently).
Year-to-date, HDGE has seen modest inflows of about $17 million, and has noticeably experienced a run here since late April. It traded at a 52-week low of $8.59 seventeen trading sessions ago, but has bounced more than 6% since to present levels.
HDGE is a short-sale oriented equity only strategy, not employing futures in order to be bearish on the market, and fund literature states the following:
“The Portfolio Manager implements a bottom-up, fundamental, research driven security selection process. In selecting short positions, the Fund seeks to identify securities with low earnings quality or aggressive accounting which may be intended on the part of company management to mask operational deterioration and bolster the reported earnings per share over a short time period. In addition, the Portfolio Manager seeks to identify earnings driven events that may act as a catalyst to the price decline of a security, such as downwards earnings revisions or reduced forward guidance.”
Presently the fund has a heavy cash component and its top “short equity” positions are in the following names: 1) DDR, 2) CBL, 3) MDSO, 4) AYI, and 5) DATA. Note that DDR has really tumbled lately, trading at a new 52-week low today as are CBL and AYI.
HDGE is the largest “non-index” equity ETF classified in the “Inverse Equity” space behind such funds like “Bear” ETFs from ProShares that are meant largely for aggressive trading and/or hedging, because the funds are designed to deliver the daily inverse return of a benchmark index, i.e. SH (ProShares Short S&P 500, Expense Ratio 0.89%, $1.9 billion in AUM), RWM (ProShares Short Russell 2000, Expense Ratio 0.95%, $342 million in AUM), PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ, Expense Ratio 0.95%, $269 million in AUM), and DOG (ProShares Short Dow 30, Expense Ratio 0.95%, $258 million in AUM).

The AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (NYSE:HDGE) was trading at $9.10 per share on Wednesday afternoon, up $0.12 (+1.34%). Year-to-date, HDGE has declined -1.62%, versus a 6.24% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
HDGE currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of C (Neutral), and is ranked #13 of 19 ETFs in the Alternative ETFs category.

AdvisorShares Debuts YieldPro ETF [AdvisorShares Trust] | ETF Daily News - Part 2



































 



























































AdvisorShares Debuts YieldPro ETF [AdvisorShares Trust]


 March 7, 2014 5:44pm  NYSE:YPRO  



 




Sweta Killa: AdvisorShares, the Maryland-based ETF issuer leading the active ETFs space, continues its expansion of innovative products in accordance with the small investment firms.




The issuer has rolled out AdvisorShares YieldPro ETF providing investors a new play in the high yield space with enhanced protection from volatility. Its latest foray into the space comes from The Elements Financial Group, which is acting as the portfolio manager for YPRO. The latest addition raises the existing active ETFs line-up to 24.
YPRO in Focus
The new ETF is a fund of funds that looks to offer investors current income and capital appreciation by investing in both long and short positions across a variety of fixed income ETFs or other income producing ETFs.
In the portfolio construction of YPRO, the manager will pursue attractive yield and handle volatility through a quantitative approach to risk budgeting, which also includes the use of options to hedge residual equity and interest rate risk when needed. Due to this unique selection of bond ETFs, the fund seeks to provide diversification benefits across multiple fixed income segments.
Currently, this strategy produces a well-diversified fund of funds that has long positions in over two dozen ETFs. Top three holdings, at the time of writing, include PowerShares Preferred Portfolio (PGX), Peritus High Yield ETF (HYLD – ETF report) and Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT) with 15.04%, 13.84% and 12.45% share, respectively (read: HYLD: The Best Choice Among High Yield Bond ETFs?).
Investors should note that the fund has a somewhat-high expense ratio when compared to index funds as the net expense comes in at 1.42%.
How does this fit in a portfolio?
The new product appears an interesting choice for investors seeking yield maximization in the current low interest environment while targeting a lower level of risk. This is because YPRO’s unique combination of risk budgeting and hedging provides less volatility, high flexibility and low correlations to the equity market.
With modest tapering underway, a cushion against rising rates has become necessary. With the launch of YPRO, investors could smartly manage interest rate risk given the fund’s innovative approach and risk-adjusted returns with competitive yields.
Competition
Though this new actively managed ETF of ETFs does not have any direct competitor due to its unique long and short strategy, it might still face tough competition from several products available in the high yield space.
The most popular is iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) that has accumulated nearly $13.8 billion and charges 50 bps in fees a year from investors. The fund has average maturity and effective duration of 4.23 years and 3.90 years, respectively.
Another product is SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), which has $10.4 million in AUM and 0.40% in expense ratio. The ETF targets intermediate end of the yield curve with average maturity of 6.65 years and modified average duration of 4.08 years.
Apart from these, First Trust High Yield Long/Short ETF (HYLS) could pose a strong obstacle to the new entrant. This fund seeks to provide a high level of income while reducing the interest rate risk to some extent (see: all High Yield ETFs here).
HYLS intends to maintain both long and short positions – long positions in high-yield debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. corporate debt obligations, bank loans and convertible bonds, and short positions in high yield U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds. The fund charges 1.28% in annual fees.
Bottom Line
The new ETF from AdvisorShares could see big inflows if it can manage to generate stronger yields than the other choices. Though the cost of the product is bit expensive, it is probably far less than the ‘traditional’ hedge funds. However, active management and need to understand the fund’s insight might restrict volume levels at the initial stage, suggesting wide bid ask spreads.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account.

Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.

Best In The Business!!!

Bob Morgan and his team are amazing!  When my father passed away unexpectedly, they stepped in and helped us through all the paper work and logistics of settling my fathers estate.  Emotions were high and there were a lot of different decisions to make.  Bob was a crucial part in settling everything and helping our family through a very difficult time.  His team is reliable, fair, and trustworthy.  We have used Morgan Law Office for other situations since, along with other friends and family, and it has been a great experience each time!

History[edit]
The firm launched its first active ETF fund in 2009.[2] By 2014 it had 24 active ETFs and $1.83 billion under management.[3] AdvisorShares is a subsidiary of Fund.com, which has a 60% ownership interest.[4]
AdvisorShares partners with third party financial advisers who already manage clients’ assets to package their investment strategy using exchange-traded funds. As part of promoting its funds it also provides educational support to help financial advisors and investors understand actively managed ETFs and their underlying investment strategies.[5][6]
In October 2012 Esposito Securities LLC sued AdvisorShares, claiming that the parties signed a mutual nondisclosure agreement and that subsequently Dan Ahrens, an officer of AdvisorShares, began sharing confidential information with Esposito's clients and told them not to do business with Esposito.[7]
Funds[edit]
The DENT Tactical ETF[edit]
The Dent Tactical ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 15, 2009 under the NYSE: DENT. The first product of AdvisorShares Investments, LLC, DENT was actively managed by HS Dent Investment Management, LLC, an independent economic research and forecasting company and publisher of The Dent Method.[8]
HS Dent Investment Management was managed by financial author, Harry S. Dent Jr. Previously, HS Dent had raised and managed a $2.0 billion mutual fund, AIM Dent Demographic Trends, which was merged into another fund after it lost 80% of its assets.[9] According to Morningstar, Inc., DENT had highest expense ratio among ETFs, 1.5% of assets, as of July 2011.[10]
DENT closed in August 2012.[11] Its last day of trading was August 8, 2012 and remaining investments were returned to shareholders on August 15, 2012.[12]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF (NYSE symbol: GRV)[edit]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 9, 2010 under the NYSE Ticker: GRV and was managed by Mars Hill Partners, LLC. GRV was the industry's first actively managed long/short ETF.[13]
While GRV managed to raise $38 million a month after it launched, investors fled until the fund had only $3.2 million left. On December 1, 2011, Accuvest Global Advisors took over management of the fund and changed the name and ticker to AdvisorShares Accuvest Global Long Short ETF (AGLS).[13]
The Global Echo ETF (NYSE Symbol: GIVE) and partnership with Philippe Cousteau Jr.[edit]
In May 2012, AdvisorShares launched the AdvisorShares Global Echo ETF on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: GIVE focused on sustainable investing; the fund also said it would donate a portion of the fund expense fees to Global Echo Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by Philippe Cousteau, Jr. focused on social issues impacting women and children to environmental conservation, as well as supporting social entrepreneurship.[14] The fund's expense ratio is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off.[15]

History[edit]
The firm launched its first active ETF fund in 2009.[2] By 2014 it had 24 active ETFs and $1.83 billion under management.[3] AdvisorShares is a subsidiary of Fund.com, which has a 60% ownership interest.[4]
AdvisorShares partners with third party financial advisers who already manage clients’ assets to package their investment strategy using exchange-traded funds. As part of promoting its funds it also provides educational support to help financial advisors and investors understand actively managed ETFs and their underlying investment strategies.[5][6]
In October 2012 Esposito Securities LLC sued AdvisorShares, claiming that the parties signed a mutual nondisclosure agreement and that subsequently Dan Ahrens, an officer of AdvisorShares, began sharing confidential information with Esposito's clients and told them not to do business with Esposito.[7]
Funds[edit]
The DENT Tactical ETF[edit]
The Dent Tactical ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 15, 2009 under the NYSE: DENT. The first product of AdvisorShares Investments, LLC, DENT was actively managed by HS Dent Investment Management, LLC, an independent economic research and forecasting company and publisher of The Dent Method.[8]
HS Dent Investment Management was managed by financial author, Harry S. Dent Jr. Previously, HS Dent had raised and managed a $2.0 billion mutual fund, AIM Dent Demographic Trends, which was merged into another fund after it lost 80% of its assets.[9] According to Morningstar, Inc., DENT had highest expense ratio among ETFs, 1.5% of assets, as of July 2011.[10]
DENT closed in August 2012.[11] Its last day of trading was August 8, 2012 and remaining investments were returned to shareholders on August 15, 2012.[12]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF (NYSE symbol: GRV)[edit]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 9, 2010 under the NYSE Ticker: GRV and was managed by Mars Hill Partners, LLC. GRV was the industry's first actively managed long/short ETF.[13]
While GRV managed to raise $38 million a month after it launched, investors fled until the fund had only $3.2 million left. On December 1, 2011, Accuvest Global Advisors took over management of the fund and changed the name and ticker to AdvisorShares Accuvest Global Long Short ETF (AGLS).[13]
The Global Echo ETF (NYSE Symbol: GIVE) and partnership with Philippe Cousteau Jr.[edit]
In May 2012, AdvisorShares launched the AdvisorShares Global Echo ETF on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: GIVE focused on sustainable investing; the fund also said it would donate a portion of the fund expense fees to Global Echo Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by Philippe Cousteau, Jr. focused on social issues impacting women and children to environmental conservation, as well as supporting social entrepreneurship.[14] The fund's expense ratio is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off.[15]

CWS ETF-  Eddy Elfenbein, portfolio manager of the AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF (NYSE Arca: CWS) appeared on CNBC's "Halftime Report" and discussed his investment approach employed in CWS as well as the actively managed ETF’s innovative fulcrum fee structure.

Innovation
AdvisorShares ETFs offer operational and tax efficiencies, which lower investment expenses and typically improve the overall investment return.  ETFs are, however, subject to commission costs each time you buy or sell.


Transparency
AdvisorShares ETFs offer daily transparency and liquidity, which provides investors the ability to understand what the ETF owns and know the true value of their investment.  Although liquid, ETFs fluctuate in value.


Diversification
AdvisorShares offers a variety of investment strategies by investment managers who are experts in their field.

The Dent Tactical ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 15, 2009 under the NYSE: DENT. The first product of AdvisorShares Investments, LLC, DENT was actively managed by HS Dent Investment Management, LLC, an independent economic research and forecasting company and publisher of The Dent Method.[8]
HS Dent Investment Management was managed by financial author, Harry S. Dent Jr. Previously, HS Dent had raised and managed a $2.0 billion mutual fund, AIM Dent Demographic Trends, which was merged into another fund after it lost 80% of its assets.[9] According to Morningstar, Inc., DENT had highest expense ratio among ETFs, 1.5% of assets, as of July 2011.[10]
DENT closed in August 2012.[11] Its last day of trading was August 8, 2012 and remaining investments were returned to shareholders on August 15, 2012.[12]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF (NYSE symbol: GRV)[edit]
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 9, 2010 under the NYSE Ticker: GRV and was managed by Mars Hill Partners, LLC. GRV was the industry's first actively managed long/short ETF.[13]
While GRV managed to raise $38 million a month after it launched, investors fled until the fund had only $3.2 million left. On December 1, 2011, Accuvest Global Advisors took over management of the fund and changed the name and ticker to AdvisorShares Accuvest Global Long Short ETF (AGLS).[13]
The Global Echo ETF (NYSE Symbol: GIVE) and partnership with Philippe Cousteau Jr.[edit]
In May 2012, AdvisorShares launched the AdvisorShares Global Echo ETF on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: GIVE focused on sustainable investing; the fund also said it would donate a portion of the fund expense fees to Global Echo Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by Philippe Cousteau, Jr. focused on social issues impacting women and children to environmental conservation, as well as supporting social entrepreneurship.[14] The fund's expense ratio is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off.[15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
