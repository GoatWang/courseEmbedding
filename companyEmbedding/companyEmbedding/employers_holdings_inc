FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Where EMPLOYERS Operates

Customer Support

Glossary of Terms







 


EMPLOYERS® is a group of companies providing workers' compensation insurance and services to select, small American businesses. We understand the workers’ compensation insurance needs of independent, entrepreneurial businesspeople because we focus on only one type of customer—small businesses. We understand the small business-based risks of workplace injury and accident, and we work hard to help protect each insured business’s bottom line. Knowledgeable, responsive underwriters, loss control experts, and claims specialists work closely with the businesses we insure to develop workers' compensation coverage, services and programs that fit their business philosophy and goals.
Our workers’ compensation insurance products and services are targeted toward small businesses. Working with independent insurance agencies and our strategic distribution partners, our underwriters use their local market expertise and disciplined underwriting to select specific types of businesses and risks that allow us to provide policyholders with competitive rates.
Our financial strength and stability is recognized by the A.M. Best Company, which continues to rate the group A- (Excellent). This rating does not refer to our ability to meet non-insurance obligations and is not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by us or to buy, hold and sell our securities.
 
 

Workers' compensation insurance is offered through the following subsidiaries:


Employers Compensation Insurance Company (ECIC)
Employers Insurance Company of Nevada (EICN)
Employers Preferred Insurance Company (EPIC)
Employers Assurance Company (EAC) 

NOTE: Not all insurers do business in all jurisdictions.
