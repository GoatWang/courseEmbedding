Devon Values


HIRE THE BEST PEOPLE


ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING


DELIVER RESULTS


BE A TEAM PLAYER


BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR



Our belief that our people are our most important asset provides the foundation for all of our values and convictions. Our extensive portfolio of corporate resources is, however, not enough to make us "the best." To be the best, we need the best people – people who are always striving to obtain more and to maximize value for our company.
The most important of our values, integrity, defines the core of every relationship we have. Whether inside the company or outside the company, integrity establishes the trust that is critical to the relationships that make our values work. Embracing honesty and integrity as our most important value means we stick by our word and we will always do the right thing, even when no one is looking.
As stewards of a public company, it is our job to constantly strive to increase shareholder value. That is why we have to be results-driven with a clear focus on achievement. By conducting our business with a sense of urgency, we will remain more agile than companies a fraction of our size with the result that "big" will never mean slow.
A central value of our company is the belief that teamwork and collaboration will create a better organization, provide more fulfillment for employees, significantly reduce bureaucracy and dramatically improve results. Teamwork and cooperation increases nimbleness, enhances effectiveness and helps to create an atmosphere of trust and goodwill that directly results in better performance.
With the continued expansion of our business, the spectrum of communities that are touched by our operations continually broadens. That is why we have a fundamental respect for the environment and the people and communities in which we operate.

Energy stocks lead S&P 500 decliners as crude extends recent losses
Energy stocks led S&P 500 decliners on Tuesday, as crude oil prices extended recent losses after OPEC stopped short of more aggressive action to cut production. July West Texas Intermediate crude  declined by 35 cents, or 0.7%, to $49.46 a barrel, as traders returned to their desks after the holiday weekend. Devon Energy  was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Kinder Morgan Inc.  shed 2.6%, Hess Corp.  fell 2.4% and Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was down 2.5%. Cimarex Energy Co.  fell 2.2% and Williams Companies Inc.  was down 1.9%. Pioneer Natural Resources Corp.  fell 1.9% and Marathon Oil Corp.  was down 1.9%. Tesoro Corp.  bucked the trend to gain 0.7%, after the stock was upgraded to overweight from equal weight Tuesday at Morgan Stanley. Analysts pointed to several catalysts for the oil refiner, including its acquisition of Western Refining Inc., which they expect will diversify its growth opportunities. The S&P 500  was flat.

Energy stocks lead S&P 500 decliners as crude extends recent losses
Energy stocks led S&P 500 decliners on Tuesday, as crude oil prices extended recent losses after OPEC stopped short of more aggressive action to cut production. July West Texas Intermediate crude  declined by 35 cents, or 0.7%, to $49.46 a barrel, as traders returned to their desks after the holiday weekend. Devon Energy  was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Kinder Morgan Inc.  shed 2.6%, Hess Corp.  fell 2.4% and Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was down 2.5%. Cimarex Energy Co.  fell 2.2% and Williams Companies Inc.  was down 1.9%. Pioneer Natural Resources Corp.  fell 1.9% and Marathon Oil Corp.  was down 1.9%. Tesoro Corp.  bucked the trend to gain 0.7%, after the stock was upgraded to overweight from equal weight Tuesday at Morgan Stanley. Analysts pointed to several catalysts for the oil refiner, including its acquisition of Western Refining Inc., which they expect will diversify its growth opportunities. The S&P 500  was flat.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction  The following discussion and analysis presents management's perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.  Overview of 2016 Results  By executing on our strategy outlined in "Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties" of this report, we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow, earnings, production and reserves, all on a per debt-adjusted share basis. Despite the challenges our company and the entire upstream energy sector have faced from the sustained low commodity price environment, we have continued to execute our strategy and position our company for long-term success. Although we have seen moderate improvements in oil and natural gas prices over the course of 2016, prices for oil and natural gas were still significantly lower than 2015 and 2014 and remain under pressure due to excess supply concerns. In response to this environment, we remained committed to an approach centered on:   Maintaining a balanced portfolio of high-class assets with a focus on value and returns,   Accelerating our activity in the STACK and Delaware Basin, and preserving continuity in our other U.S. resource plays,   Driving efficiencies across our portfolio of assets by achieving operating efficiencies and cost savings and increasing capital productivity, and   Protecting and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet by investing directionally within cash flow and through use of divestiture proceeds.  To that end, in 2016 we:   Expanded our position in the STACK by acquiring approximately 80,000 net acres and assets for $1.5 billion, and increased production in this key resource play by 37% compared to 2015;   Continued the shift to higher-margin products, with oil and bitumen production representing 44% of our retained asset production mix for 2016;   Successfully divested certain non-core upstream assets in the U.S. and our 50% interest in the Access Pipeline in Canada for $3.1 billion;   Reduced exploratory and developmental capital investment by approximately 65% compared to 2015;   Replaced approximately 175% of our retained-asset production through significant reserve additions;   Reduced G&A and field operating costs by $845 million, or 25%, primarily through cost reduction initiatives, including a workforce reduction in early 2016;   Reduced Devon debt by $3.1 billion, or 31%, and have no significant long term maturities until 2021;   Raised net proceeds of $1.5 billion in an offering of our common stock; and   Exited 2016 with approximately $5 billion in cash and Senior Credit Facility capacity.  In 2017 and beyond, we have the financial capacity to further accelerate investment across our best-in-class U.S. resource plays. We are increasing drilling activity and will continue to rapidly shift our production mix to high-margin products. We will continue our premier technical work to drive capital allocation and efficiency and industry-leading well productivity results. We will continue to maximize the value of our base production by sustaining the operational efficiencies we have achieved. Finally, we will continue to manage activity levels within our cash flows. We expect this disciplined approach will position us to deliver substantial cash flow expansion over the next two years.  Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements  In addition, we recognized $267 million of restructuring and transaction costs during 2016 related to the workforce reduction and incurred $5.0 billion of noncash asset impairments as a result of the continued depressed prices for commodities but recognized $1.9 billion in gains on our divestiture transactions. While the gain on divestitures and impairments significantly impacted our earnings, they had no effect on our operating cash flow or debt covenants.  Key measures of our financial performance in 2016 are summarized in the following table:   Year Ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 (Millions, except per share and per Boe amounts) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Devon $ (3,302 ) + 77 % $ (14,454 ) N/M $ 1,607 Net earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon $ (6.52 ) + 82 % $ (35.55 ) N/M $ 3.91 Core earnings (loss) attributable to Devon (1) $ (38 ) - 104 % $ 1,044 - 48 % $ 2,017 Core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon (1) $ (0.08 ) - 103 % $ 2.52 - 49 % $ 4.91 Retained production (MBoe/d) 568 - 4 % 589 +13 % 521 Total production (MBoe/d) 611 - 10 % 680 +1 % 673 Realized price per Boe (2) $ 18.72 - 14 % $ 21.68 - 46 % $ 40.33 Operating cash flow $ 1,746 - 68 % $ 5,373 - 11 % $ 6,021 Capitalized costs, including acquisitions $ 4,191 - 33 % $ 6,233 - 54 % $ 13,559 Shareholder and noncontrolling interests distributions $ 525 - 19 % $ 650 +5 % $ 621 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,959 - 15 % $ 2,310 +56 % $ 1,480 Total debt $ 10,154 - 22 % $ 13,032 +16 % $ 11,193 Reserves (MMBoe) 2,058 - 6 % 2,182 - 21 % 2,754  (1) Core earnings and core earnings per share attributable to Devon are financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of core earnings and core earnings per share attributable to Devon, as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, see "Non-GAAP Measures" in this Item 7.  (2) Excludes any impact of oil, gas and NGL derivatives.  Our 2016 net loss and net loss per share improved compared to 2015 primarily due to more significant noncash asset impairments recognized in 2015 as a result of the large commodity price declines. Core loss, core loss per share and operating cash flow for 2016 decreased significantly compared to 2015 as a result of the continued decline in commodity prices and the expiration of certain favorable commodity hedging positions.  Business and Industry Outlook  Devon marked its 45th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 28th year as a public company during 2016. As an established company with a strong leadership team, we have experience operating in periods of challenged commodity prices. With our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets, we are prepared to successfully navigate the current environment while ensuring our long-term financial strength.  Market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. During 2016, oil prices ranged from $26.21/Bbl to $54.06/Bbl. As a result of the ongoing worldwide oversupply issue, OPEC agreed to its first oil production cut in eight years in November 2016. Following the agreements by both OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reduce output by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017, oil prices jumped approximately 10% in the fourth quarter of 2016, averaging $49.21/Bbl. Current market fundamentals indicate improved prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in 2017; however, changes in OPEC production strategies, the macro-economic environment, geopolitical risks, winter and summer temperature ranges or other factors could impact current forecasts. As such, we anticipate continued volatility into 2017.  Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements  While we expect that our industry will remain challenged by relatively low prices for the near-term, we have strategically positioned our company for continued growth and investment in our portfolio of assets. Leveraging the success of our 2016 divestiture program and other key achievements noted above, we are in a position of significant strength and anticipate expanding our exploration and development capital spend by approximately 80% in 2017. Our 2017 outlook is marked by accelerated activity across our key basins, focusing an expanded rig count in the STACK and Delaware Basin and achieving 15% growth in U.S. oil production through some of our best-in-class positions. Additionally, we ramped up our hedging program in 2016, with approximately 50% of our oil and 45% of our gas production hedged entering into 2017.  Finally, EnLink continues to be a strategic advantage for us, allowing for improved midstream growth potential. Annual distributions of approximately $270 million provide a visible cash flow stream to be further invested in our upstream capital programs discussed above.

(2) The reported Canadian gas volumes include 11, 12 and 21 MMcf/d for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, that are produced from certain of our leases and then transported to our Jackfish operations where the gas is used as fuel. However, the revenues and expenses related to this consumed gas are eliminated in our consolidated financial results. With the sale of the vast majority of the Canadian gas business in the second quarter of 2014, the eliminated gas revenues subsequently impacted our gas price more significantly.  Commodity Sales The volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil, gas and NGL sales. Oil Bitumen Gas NGLs Total (Millions) 2014 sales $ 4,773 $ 1,138 $ 2,737 $ 1,262 $ 9,910 Change due to volumes 976 584 (443 ) (23 ) 1,094 Change due to prices (2,813 ) (1,000 ) (1,034 ) (775 ) (5,622 ) 2015 sales $ 2,936 $ 722 $ 1,260 $ 464 $ 5,382 Change due to volumes (608 ) 209 (151 ) (70 ) (620 ) Change due to prices (299 ) (143 ) (159 ) 21 (580 ) 2016 sales $ 2,029 $ 788 $ 950 $ 415 $ 4,182  Volumes 2016 vs. 2015 Commodity sales decreased due to our 67% reduction in exploration and development capital related to our retained assets during 2016. While expanded drilling in the STACK and the performance of our Jackfish assets drove production increases, these production increases were more than offset by reduced completion activity in the Eagle Ford and natural production declines in the Barnett Shale and Rockies Oil. Delaware Basin production was relatively flat as natural declines offset the increases from new wells. Additionally, our production decreased as a result of our U.S. non-core divestiture program.  Volumes 2015 vs. 2014 Commodity sales increased due to volumes in 2015 because of strong production growth from our U.S. oil properties. The growth was primarily driven by the continued development of our Eagle  Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements  Ford, Delaware Basin and Rockies Oil properties. Additionally, our bitumen production increased primarily due to Jackfish 3 coming on-line late in the third quarter of 2014 and reaching nameplate capacity in the third quarter of 2015. Lower royalties resulting from the significant price decrease also increased our heavy oil production. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in our gas production, which resulted primarily from asset divestitures in 2014 and natural reservoir declines.  Prices 2016 vs. 2015 Commodity sales decreased in 2016 as a result of lower prices for oil, bitumen and gas. The decrease in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from lower average WTI crude oil index prices, which were approximately 11% lower in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decreases in gas were driven by lower North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based. These decreases were partially offset by slightly higher NGL prices at the Mont Belvieu, Texas hub.  Prices 2015 vs. 2014 Commodity sales decreased in 2015 as a result of significantly lower prices for all commodities. The decrease in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from significantly lower average WTI crude oil index prices, which were approximately 50% lower in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decreases in gas and NGL sales were driven by lower North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and lower NGL prices at the Mont Belvieu, Texas hub.  Oil, Gas and NGL Derivatives  The following tables provide financial information associated with our oil, gas and NGL hedges. The first table presents the cash settlements and fair value gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues. The subsequent tables present our oil, gas and NGL prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements. The prices do not include the effects of fair value gains and losses.   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (Millions) Cash settlements: Oil derivatives $ (41 ) $ 2,083 $ 90 Gas derivatives 35 333 (36 ) NGL derivatives (5 ) - 1 Total cash settlements (11 ) 2,416 55 Gains (losses) on fair value changes: Oil derivatives (103 ) (1,687 ) 1,721 Gas derivatives (86 ) (226 ) 213 NGL derivatives (1 ) - - Total gains (losses) on fair value changes (190 ) (1,913 ) 1,934 Oil, gas and NGL derivatives $ (201 ) $ 503 $ 1,989  Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements   Year Ended December 31, 2016 Oil Bitumen Gas NGLs Boe (Per Bbl) (Per Bbl) (Per Mcf) (Per Bbl) (Per Boe) Realized price without hedges $ 36.72 $ 19.82 $ 1.84 $ 9.81 $ 18.72 Cash settlements of hedges (0.74 ) - 0.07 (0.11 ) (0.05 ) Realized price, including cash settlements $ 35.98 $ 19.82 $ 1.91 $ 9.70 $ 18.67 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Oil Bitumen Gas NGLs Boe (Per Bbl) (Per Bbl) (Per Mcf) (Per Bbl) (Per Boe) Realized price without hedges $ 42.12 $ 23.41 $ 2.14 $ 9.32 $ 21.68 Cash settlements of hedges 29.88 - 0.57 - 9.74 Realized price, including cash settlements $ 72.00 $ 23.41 $ 2.71 $ 9.32 $ 31.42 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Oil Bitumen Gas NGLs Boe (Per Bbl) (Per Bbl) (Per Mcf) (Per Bbl) (Per Boe) Realized price without hedges $ 82.47 $ 55.88 $ 3.90 $ 24.89 $ 40.33 Cash settlements of hedges 1.56 - (0.05 ) 0.02 0.22 Realized price, including cash settlements $ 84.03 $ 55.88 $ 3.85 $ 24.91 $ 40.55  Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments. A summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in Note 3 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report. Our oil, gas and NGL derivatives include price swaps, costless collars and basis swaps.  In addition to cash settlements, we also recognize fair value changes on our oil, gas and NGL derivative instruments in each reporting period. The changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period, as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves. Including the cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives incurred a net loss in 2016 and generated net gains in 2015 and 2014.  Marketing and Midstream Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 (Millions) Operating revenues $ 6,323 - 13 % $ 7,260 - 5 % $ 7,667 Product purchases (5,133 ) - 15 % (6,028 ) - 8 % (6,540 ) Operations and maintenance expenses (359 ) - 8 % (392 ) +43 % (275 ) Operating profit $ 831 - 1 % $ 840 - 1 % $ 852 Devon profit (loss) $ (48 ) - 443 % $ 14 - 84 % $ 88 EnLink profit 879 +6 % 826 +8 % 764 Total profit $ 831 - 1 % $ 840 - 1 % $ 852  2016 vs. 2015 The overall decrease in marketing and midstream margin during 2016 was primarily due to lower margins on Devon's downstream marketing commitments, offset by EnLink's margin growth largely related to its acquisition activity in late 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We anticipate the margins on Devon's downstream marketing commitments to continue to negatively impact our marketing and midstream margins into 2017.  Table of Contents  Index to Financial Statements  2015 vs. 2014 Marketing and midstream operating profit changes were largely driven by a decrease in Devon's marketing activities due to a decrease in commodity prices. These declines were partially offset by a full year of EnLink's legacy asset operations compared to prior year and facility expansions coming online in late 2014, along with assets acquired during 2015.  Asset Dispositions and Other  During 2016, we recognized gains of $1.9 billion in conjunction with the non-core U.S. upstream asset divestitures and the divestiture of our 50% interest in the Access Pipeline in Canada. During 2014, in conjunction with the divestiture of certain Canadian properties, we recognized gains of $1.1 billion. For further discussion, see Note 2 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.  Lease Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 (Millions, except per Boe amounts) LOE: U.S. $ 1,123 - 28 % $ 1,551 - 0 % $ 1,559 Canada 459 - 17 % 553 - 28 % 773 Total $ 1,582 - 25 % $ 2,104 - 10 % $ 2,332 LOE per Boe: U.S. $ 6.44 - 14 % $ 7.52 +0 % $ 7.52 Canada $ 9.36 - 29 % $ 13.18 - 34 % $ 20.10 Total $ 7.08 - 17 % $ 8.48 - 11 % $ 9.49  2016 vs. 2015 LOE and LOE per Boe decreased during 2016 primarily due to our well optimization and cost reduction initiatives, as well as our non-core oil and gas property divestitures. On an absolute dollar basis, LOE decreased approximately $200 million as a result of our U.S. upstream divestitures, and we anticipate realizing approximately $100 million in additional LOE savings in . . .
