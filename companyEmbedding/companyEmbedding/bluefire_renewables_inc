Introduction
Based fuel have kept the production of chemicals mainly confined to producing ethanol from corn sugar - until now.

History, Technology, & Projects

enlarged flowchart

The production of chemicals by fermenting various sugars is a well-accepted science. Its use ranges from producing beverage alcohol and fuel-ethanol to making citric acid and xantham gum for food uses. However, the high price of sugar and the relatively low cost of competing petroleum-based fuel have kept the production of chemicals mainly confined to producing ethanol from corn sugar – until now.
The Company has developed significant proprietary improvements to a well-known conversion technology known as Concentrated Acid Hydrolysis such that the process is ready for commercial implementation. The Technology is unique in that, for the first time, it enables widely available cellulosic materials, or more commonly, biomass, to be converted into sugar in an economically viable manner, thereby providing an inexpensive raw material for fermentation or chemical conversion into any of a hundred different specialty and/or commodity chemicals. 
Biomass feedstocks include:

agricultural residues (straws, corn stalks and cobs, bagasse, cotton gin trash, palm oil wastes, etc.),
crops grown specifically for their biomass (grasses, sweet sorghum, fast growing trees, etc.),
paper (recycled newspaper, paper mill sludge’s, sorted municipal solid waste, etc.),
wood wastes (prunings, wood chips, sawdust, etc.), and green wastes (leaves, grass clippings, vegetable and fruit wastes, etc.).

green wastes (leaves, grass clippings, vegetable and fruit wastes, etc.).

The ability to utilize low cost feedstock, and/or those that command tipping fees, to produce products that sell into highly efficient markets provides a viable business that can be sited in almost any geographic area, urban or rural. Due to its moderate use of thermal energy, the production of minimal waste streams, its significant environmental benefits, and minimal permitting requirements, the Technology also makes an ideal “thermal host” for cogeneration facilities.
The Technology
Development History – It has been known for over 100 years that acids act as catalyst to convert (“hydrolyze”) cellulose and hemicellulose into simple sugars (hexose and pentose, or “C6 and C5” sugars). The Germans and Russians used this simple procedure in the early part of this century to produce alcohol fuels and chemicals from wood in order to supply their war efforts. During this same period, a similar plant was operated in the United States in Oregon. However they all shared a similar characteristic – they were not economically competitive with low cost petroleum products because of poor yields, high wastage, and the large volume of unmarketable by-products. Except for a few plants in Russia, the technology fell out of use after World War II.
However, interest in the conversion of biomass-to-sugars picked up in the mid 1970’s due to the oil embargo and the United States’ desire to lessen its dependence on foreign chemical and fuel feedstocks. Further interest was stirred in 1983 when DuPont published an article in Science magazine detailing the variety of chemical products that could be produced via fermentation of sugar. Since that time many universities and government laboratories have been studying the hydrolysis of cellulose, either through the application of various acids or enzymes. Most notable in regard to acid hydrolysis, had been the work undertaken at the Tennessee Valley Authority and Mississippi State University.
In 1989 Arkenol, as a related company to ARK Energy, began researching several technologies in order to develop thermal hosts for siting in conjunction with ARK Energy power plant projects that were being bid into local utilities. Arkenol determined that the Concentrated Acid Hydrolysis process could be made economically viable through the use of new technology, modern control methods, and newer materials of construction. Engineers and their consultants were able to solve the problems with the following proprietary improvements that now make the process economically viable:

efficient acid recovery and reconcentration;
high sugar concentration at high purity;
the ability to ferment C6 and C5 sugars efficiently with conventional microbes;
the ability to handle silica in biomass feedstocks; and,
all by-products are usable and marketable.

Project Developments
BlueFire is currently in the process of developing two cellulosic ethanol facilities in Lancaster, California and Fulton, Mississippi. The fully-permitted and shovel-ready Lancaster facility, BlueFire’s first U.S. commercial plant, will use post-sorted cellulosic wastes diverted from Southern California’s landfills to produce approximately 3.9 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year. BlueFire is in the detailed engineering phase for its second commercial plant in Fulton, MS, which will produce approximately 19 million gallons of ethanol per year from woody biomass, mill residue, and other cellulosic waste. These two planned facilities will create more than 1,000 construction jobs and, once in operation, more than 100 new operations and maintenance jobs. This is in addition to the hundreds of jobs created or maintained at equipment vendors and suppliers that will be involved in the company’s other projects.
BlueFire Renewables recently announced that the Department of Energy has determined that BlueFire has met the requirements necessary for Phase I completion of the application process for its Loan Guarantee and that the company has been invited to continue on to Phase II for the financing of their Fulton, MS Project.
The Process  
To demonstrate the efficacy of the technology Arkenol constructed and operated a pilot plant near its Southern California offices for roughly five years. Since 2003, the technology has been successfully used by an unrelated, independent, and internationally recognized corporation to produce ethanol for the Japanese transportation fuel market. Over the last 10 years, the initial testing on a vast array of potential feedstock has been completed both in the U.S. and at various locations throughout the world. The core technology and other related processes are protected under patents issued and pending by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
An integrated, full-scale commercial process plant consists of six basic unit operations:

Feedstock preparation
Decrystallization/Hydrolysis Reaction Vessel
Solids/Liquid Filtration
Separation of the acid and sugars
Fermentation of the sugars
Product purification

Simply put, the process separates the biomass into its main constituents: cellulose and hemicellulose (the main building blocks of plant life) and lignin (the “glue” that holds the building blocks together), then converts the cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars, ferments them and purifies the fermentation liquids into products. These unit operations require a series of material and energy inputs to produce the primary products of fermentation and the resultant by-products.
If there is no power plant present from which to obtain steam, the production facility would use natural gas or lignin as fuel for its own boilers.
Incoming biomass feedstocks are cleaned and ground to reduce the particle size for the process equipment. The pretreated material is then dried to a moisture content consistent with the acid concentration requirements for decrystallization (separation of the cellulose and hemicellulose from the lignin), then hydrolyzed (degrading the chemical bonds of the cellulose) to produce hexose and pentose sugars at the high concentrations necessary for commercial fermentation. Insoluble materials, principally the lignin portion of the biomass input, are separated from the hydrolyzate by filtering and pressing and further processed into fuel or other beneficial uses.
The remaining acid-sugar solution is separated into its acid and sugar components by means of chromatographic separation.  BlueFire uses commercially available ion exchange resins to separate the components without diluting the sugar. The separated sulfuric acid is re-circulated and re-concentrated to the level required by the decrystallization and hydrolysis steps. The small quantity of acid left in the sugar solution is neutralized with lime to make hydrated gypsum, CaSO4 · 2H2O, an insoluble precipitate which is readily separated from the sugar solution and which also has beneficial use as an agricultural soil conditioner. At this point the process has produced a clean stream of mixed sugars (both C6 and C5) for fermentation.
In an ethanol production plant, naturally-occurring yeast, has been specifically cultured by a proprietary method to ferment the mixed sugar stream, is mixed with nutrients and added to the sugar solution where it efficiently converts sugars to fermentation beer (an ethanol, yeast and water mixture) and carbon dioxide. The yeast culture is separated from the fermentation beer by a centrifuge and returned to the fermentation tanks for reuse. Ethanol is separated from the now clear fermentation beer by conventional distillation technology, dehydrated to 200 proof with conventional molecular sieve technology, and denatured with unleaded gasoline to produce the final fuel-grade ethanol product. The still bottoms containing principally water and unfermented pentose sugar is returned to the process for economic water use and for further conversion of the pentose sugars.

The Real Power
“UNLESS THE LORD BUILDS THE COMPANY, WE LABOR IN VAIN WHO BUILD IT” 







The Real Power of BlueFire
Arnold Klann Founder & CEO, BlueFire Ethanol
“UNLESS THE LORD BUILDS THE COMPANY, WE LABOR IN VAIN WHO BUILD IT”
Psalms 127:1
As CEO of BlueFire Ethanol, I spend most of my time guiding and promoting the company to its final destiny of being the solution to man’s pollution and supplying the best transportation energy for the world. I talk to stakeholders all over the globe, from strategic partners in Europe and Asia Pacific to engineers in Omaha, about how to produce the lowest cost fuels and maximize carbon credits in the market. I talk to investors about the political and economic environment around alternative fuels and why our approach is the best investment. I talk to shareholders about how BlueFire is uniquely positioned to become the world leader in Biofuels production, and explain the strategic direction of the company and the return on investment they can expect as a result of my leadership. These are the types of discussions that fill the day of the typical CEO.
There is another discussion I have daily that is not typical of CEOs. I seize every opportunity to talk about the REAL POWER of BlueFire.
What do I mean by REAL POWER? What do the words stand for? How does this concept influence my leadership of the company?
REAL POWER is my stand for the following beliefs…
The company vision was supplied by God. My decisions and actions must be guided by God. All of the glory goes to God.
THE COMPANY VISION WAS SUPPLIED BY GOD
In September, 1989, I received a vision and a mandate:
MANAGE THE ENERGY RESOURCES OF THE EARTH ACCORDING TO GOD’S DESIGN.
Take a moment to imagine what God’s intended design for energy resources would be. If we would just follow God’s mandate to use the resources properly, it would lead to peace and prosperity.
Today we are running out of low cost petroleum, it is a finite resource. Because most oil is produced in areas of the world that are politically unstable at best and dangerous at worst, the USA spends billions of dollars a year protecting supply with its military. Because the world is growing economically, the demand for more oil is outstripping supply so competition is increasing and non-indigenous oil producing nations are spending more of their GDP on energy. This is destroying the ability of nations to grow and for their populations to feed themselves.
Yet most countries that don’t produce oil are agrarian based. By redirecting the agricultural model in these countries by increasing food production and creating an energy resource crop to offset their oil imports, it keeps more of the countries GDP in-country for economic development.
The key to economic growth is to create a consumer base. This can only be accomplished when the population has money to buy consumables beyond food. That requires jobs and industry.
BlueFire does all these things by first creating a supply chain for feedstock to its production plants by enabling farmers to grow energy crops that also produce food and can be used for export beyond internal consumption. Second, by producing a compatible transportation fuel for the country from the feedstock, it offsets capital that flows out of the country to buy oil thereby keeping the money in country for industrial development. Third, BlueFire can produce chemicals beyond fuels that would create the feedstock for the next industry like bio-disposable plastics, or food additives like citric acid. In the Garden of Eden, it was all about agrarian growth, let’s go back to God’s model.
At BlueFire, we believe that the company’s purpose is to create the opportunities for change that can make a difference in the lives and economies of nations through the deployment of technologies that can be low tech yet at the same time create new opportunities for the indigenous population. By giving farmers and the lowest economic level of the population the opportunity to earn more money and increase personal productivity leads to the increase for the whole nation. BlueFire changes the paradigm from a petro based econometric model to an agrarian based econometric model and the possibilities for the nation are endless, just like God had originally intended. The countries are no longer held hostage to oil.
BlueFire’s near-term mission is to free the U.S. from the turmoil and crisis of being held hostage by oil producing nations. Our long-term mission is to improve the living conditions of impoverished people in the developing world. I have participated in mission trips and have ministered to families living in waste dumps in places like Tepic, Nargarit, Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia and elsewhere. As a pastor and graduate of Cottonwood Leadership College, I see the vision and have the heart to help and change the conditions of the people society values the least. BlueFire’s technology deployment will immediately improve their living conditions through employment, and at the same time we will create a sustainable econometric model to lift them out of the dumps–literally–and help them break free of economic bondage and the spiritual oppression that comes with it.
MY DECISIONS AND ACTIONS ARE GUIDED BY GOD
My primary job is to ensure that the investment made in the company is put to the best possible use to grow the company and manage its success. This includes the investment of hard work and creativity from the team of people that work for the company, the investment of prayer from those who believe in us and are committed to our success, and the investment of those who finance the company. This is a huge responsibility.
To prepare myself for this responsibility, I completed the program at Cottonwood Christian Leadership College. This training prepared me to make decisions based on Biblical principles and minister to those who seek to establish a closer relationship with God.
ALL THE GLORY GOES TO GOD
Our team is very experienced and has been successful in commercializing technologies and running companies in the past, but it is God that uses us and gives this company success. As senior management and employees of BlueFire, we see ourselves as God’s agents here on earth to implement His vision and achieve His growth plan. God is the true builder of this company, and our security, growth and success are because of Him.

About BlueFire Renewables
BlueFire Renewables, Inc’s (“BlueFire”) use of the Arkenol patented process positions it as the only viable, world-wide cellulose conversion company with demonstrated production experience from wood wastes, urban trash (post-sorted MSW), rice and wheat straws and other agricultural residues.

BlueFire was established to deploy the proven Arkenol Process Technology (“Technology”) for the conversion of cellulosic waste materials into renewable fuels and other products. BlueFire is the exclusive North America licensee of the technology and its goal is to develop and operate high-value cellulose conversion facilities. These “biorefineries” will convert widely available, inexpensive, organic materials such as agricultural residues, high-content biomass crops, wood residues, and cellulose in municipal solid wastes into valuable and renewable end products.


BlueFire’s technology is extremely versatile, both in its ability to utilize a wide variety of feedstocks and in the end-products that it can produce. This versatility enables BlueFire to consider a wide variety of feedstocks and locations in which to develop facilities to become the lowest cost producer of renewable products from cellulosic sugars.
With the research and development work completed, patent protections in place, the product markets researched, and several full-scale BioEthanol projects currently in various stages of development, BlueFire is uniquely positioned to become the world leader in the development, ownership and operation of these biorefineries.

Profile data is unavailable for this security.About the companyBlueFire Renewables, Inc. is engaged in developing, owning and operating carbohydrate-based transportation fuel plants, or bio-refineries, to produce ethanol, and to provide professional services to bio-refineries. The Company's bio-refineries convert organic materials, such as agricultural residues, high-content biomass crops, wood residues and cellulose from municipal solid wastes into ethanol. Its Arkenol Technology's use ranges from producing beverage alcohol and fuel-ethanol to making citric acid and xantham gum for food uses. The process separates the biomass into two main constituents: cellulose and hemicellulose (the main building blocks of plant life), and lignin (the glue that holds the building blocks together), converts the cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars, ferments them and purifies the fermentation liquids into ethanol and other end-products. It is in the development-stage of building bio-refineries in North America.Revenue in USD (TTM)0.00Net income in USD-1.12mIncorporated2006Employees5.00LocationBluefire Renewables Inc31 MusickIRVINE 92618United StatesUSAPhone+1 (949) 588-3767Fax+1 (949) 588-3972Websitehttp://bfreinc.com/More ▼Peer analysisKey InformationKey InformationStock PerformancePer Share DataEfficiencyManagement EffectivenessProfitabilityFinancial StrengthGrowth RatesCompanyRevenue (TTM)Net income (TTM)Market capEmployeesPrice/earnings (TTM)Price/book value (MRQ)Price/cash flow (TTM)Price/sales (TTM)EPS (excl. extraordinary items, TTM)EPS (incl. extraordinary items, TTM)Revenue per share (TTM)Book value per share (MRQ)Asset turnover (TTM)Inventory turnover (TTM)Receivables turnover (TTM)Revenues per employee (TTM)Return on avg assets (TTM)Return on avg assets (5 yr avg)Return on investment (TTM)Return on investment (5 yr avg)Gross margin (TTM)Gross margin(5 yr avg)Net profit margin (TTM)Net Profit margin(5 yr avg)Quick ratio (MRQ)Interest coverage (TTM)Total debt to capital (MRQ)Payout ratio(5 yr avg)Revenue(YOY change %)Revenue(5 yr growth rate)Net income(YOY change %)Net income(5 yr growth rate)Capital expenditure(5 yr growth rate)Dividend(5 yr growth rate)Crailar Technologies Inc6.55m-12.18m243.09k27.00------0.0371-0.186-0.1860.1012-0.13720.370510.005.57---68.91-79.70-94.91-105.47-2.84---186.00-1,023.540.3935--2.04--614.59--6.58--83.78--IGENE Biotechnology, Inc.3.90k-2.38m313.08k18.00------80.28-0.0015-0.00150.00-0.00280.0009--0.0019216.67-52.30-37.60-98.29-99.070.00---60,905.13-59.84---------48.22--151.32------United Energy Corp.1.32m-618.01k315.04k8.00------0.2386-0.0196-0.01960.0419-0.00941.455.5813.52165,027.50-67.80------60.06---46.67--0.208-10.09----46.91---9.51------Flameret, Inc.0.00-352.90k356.30k4.00---------2.05-2.050.00-3.860.00----0.00-22,477.71-----------------22.13--------94.49------Angstrom Technologies Inc644.00k-650.00k356.92k8.00------0.5542-0.0273-0.02730.02710.06470.34620.51734.9280,500.00-24.030.3044-25.480.334839.7559.21-69.410.44756.15--0.00--26.042.3842.13---11.85--American Resources Corp118.54k-788.13k404.20k--------3.41-0.9419-0.83120.1414-0.01340.206218.80-----127.43---381.22--17.13---618.04--0.6316--2.05--135.91---96.84------BlueFire Renewables Inc0.00-1.12m449.02k5.00---------0.0027-0.00270.00-0.01120.00-------1,465.25-234.22------97.28---129.52---8.49-----100.00--6.86------China Clean Energy Inc.73.48m10.38m472.68k120.000.04560.00960.03460.00640.32930.32932.331.561.3616.8823.42612,333.0019.21--22.54--21.32--14.12--2.67--0.1247--270.02--2,062.92------New America Energy Corp0.00-259.28k498.46k0.00---------0.0049-0.00490.00-0.00470.00-------304.50-1,982.05---------------49.69--------31.38------Asia Carbon Industries Inc31.61m3.79m504.51k202.000.12640.01350.08940.0160.07120.07120.58710.66780.80789.468.09156,499.309.68--10.90--23.59--11.98--2.4535.000.0355---6.48---11.74------US Rare Earth Minerals Inc222.41k-306.30k576.12k2.00------2.59-0.0116-0.01160.0081-0.01495.60-------771.34-829.98----58.1152.44-137.72-544.740.0079-36.00-----3.6426.4366.82------Hypower Fuel Inc738.76k73.64k583.41k--8.100.30834.620.78970.00020.00020.00220.00550.2904--1.54--2.89-2.953.10-3.05----9.97-10.443.614.990.1901--7.07-4.76406.83------Data as of Jul 26 2017.

Description




BlueFire Renewables, Inc. is engaged in developing, owning and operating carbohydrate-based transportation fuel plants, or bio-refineries, to produce ethanol, and to provide professional services to bio-refineries. The Company's bio-refineries convert organic materials, such as agricultural residues, high-content biomass crops, wood residues and cellulose from municipal solid wastes into ethanol. Its Arkenol Technology's use ranges from producing beverage alcohol and fuel-ethanol to making citric acid and xantham gum for food uses. The process separates the biomass into two main constituents: cellulose and hemicellulose (the main building blocks of plant life), and lignin (the glue that holds the building blocks together), converts the cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars, ferments them and purifies the fermentation liquids into ethanol and other end-products. It is in the development-stage of building bio-refineries in North America.

WHY WE HAVE THE EDGE.
BlueFire Renewables holds the key to a better future.


BlueFire Renewables, Inc. was established to deploy a patented Concentrated Acid Hydrolysis Technology Process for the conversion of cellulosic (“Green Waste”) waste materials to ethanol, and other viable alternatives to petroleum derived fuels. BlueFire’s technology has demonstrated production of ethanol and other petroleum displacing fuels from urban trash (post-sorted MSW), rice and wheat straws, wood waste and other agricultural residues.
BlueFire is one of four ethanol companies awarded funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to construct a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol production facility. Its biorefineries will be located in markets with the highest demand for renewable transportation fuels thereby dramatically reducing delivery costs while simultaneously increasing the areas biofuel supply and reducing the waste streams sent to landfills.
