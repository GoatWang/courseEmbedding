NetSuite and Epiphany
Epiphany Inc. is a Solution Provider and a BOS Developer Program partner of NetSuite Inc. (NYSE: N). NetSuite is a leading vendor of on-demand, integrated business management software suites that include Accounting / Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Ecommerce software for small and mid-sized businesses and divisions of large companies.
NetSuite BOS (Business Operating System)
"The vision for NS-BOS is to allow developers, ISVs and solution providers to build their unique vertical-specific knowledge and services into NetSuite and deploy it in a repeatable manner to customers in that industry," said Mini Peiris, VP of Product Management of NetSuite Inc. "We are extremely pleased to see Epiphany leverage NetSuite to effectively realize the vision behind NS-BOS to address the unique needs of four distinct industries."
"The NetSuite Business Operating System opens a whole new avenue for my business," said Brenda Brinkley, CEO of Epiphany Inc. "With NS-BOS we are able to create vertical solutions for businesses that we have built best practices in, and we are also able to deliver these vertical solutions to our customers in an easy repeatable fashion without error prone, manual recreation on a per customer basis. In addition to the four vertical solutions announced today, we have many more to come — the possibilities are limitless NetSuite."
NetSuite OpenAir
In today's ultra-competitive professional services industry, you cannot afford to manage your services operations across spreadsheets and disparate point solutions. Put an end to over budget projects, revenue leakage, lengthy billing cycles, and inaccurate time and expense tracking.
NetSuite Consultants
Epiphany Inc. is a NetSuite partner creating unique software applications that provide key functionality to extend NetSuite and allows customer to utilize the best business practice and matching the NetSuite function to that business practice. Our goal is to give small and medium-sized companies the flexibility and sophistication they need from their technology to compete in the global marketplace.
Enterprise
With a single, integrated platform for CRM, ERP and Ecommerce, business functions can be automated across all departments, including sales, marketing, service, finance, inventory, order fulfillment, purchasing, and employee management. Employees no longer have to re-enter data in different systems, rectify inconsistent or inaccurate data, or wait for batch updates. Instead, all employees view and share accurate data in real time, leading to greater collaboration among departments and increased productivity throughout the company. NetSuite Total Cost of Ownership
Featured Product: NetSuite Accounting
Accounting software should streamline everyday tasks like paying bills, invoicing customers, filling out purchase orders, tracking sales tax, etc. These records should be organized and easy to retrieve — for instance, during tax time. It should also generate reports to show the financial flow and strengths of a company. These capabilities would allow the company to work more productively and be able to make informed decisions.
Featured Product: NetSuite Customer Relationship Management
A comprehensive CRM application will allow for a variety of functions – including applications for sales force automation, marketing automation, and customer service and support — that helps you manage your complete customer lifecycle. Having the entire company share a single, 360-degree view of customers will increase productivity, decrease misinformation, and make customers feel like people, not numbers.

NetSuite Inc. is an American cloud computing company based in San Mateo, California, that sells a group of software services used to manage a business's financials, operations and customer relations.[3] NetSuite's services are aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, although larger enterprises can also benefit from the consolidated ERP, CRM and e-commerce features.[4] Oracle Corporation offered to purchase NetSuite for approximately $9.3 billion USD in July 2016, with the deal finalizing in November 2016.

History[edit]
NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled.[5] NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company’s 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition.[2]
In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO.  Nelson had deep background in sales and marketing, holding a variety of executive positions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.  Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp.[6]  This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite.  Nelson led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp.[7]
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Moneyball General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[8]
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007.[9] Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 [10] it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.[2]
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.[2]
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Relationship with Oracle Corporation[edit]
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.[11] Both founder Goldberg and CEO Nelson worked at Oracle Corp. prior to forming NetSuite.[12][13]  Goldberg joined Oracle immediately after graduating from Harvard College in 1987, and held a variety of positions in R&D. Nelson joined Oracle in 1992 as Vice President of Marketing, ultimately working directly for Larry Ellison.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison,[14] founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures.[15] Other initial investors were StarVest Partners[16] ADP and UBS PaineWebber.[17] The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.[18]
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."[19]
Products[edit]
NetSuite groups its services into four main suites plus NetSuite OneWorld:[citation needed]

History[edit]
NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled.[5] NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company’s 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition.[2]
In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO.  Nelson had deep background in sales and marketing, holding a variety of executive positions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.  Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp.[6]  This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite.  Nelson led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp.[7]
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Moneyball General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[8]
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007.[9] Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 [10] it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.[2]
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.[2]
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Relationship with Oracle Corporation[edit]
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.[11] Both founder Goldberg and CEO Nelson worked at Oracle Corp. prior to forming NetSuite.[12][13]  Goldberg joined Oracle immediately after graduating from Harvard College in 1987, and held a variety of positions in R&D. Nelson joined Oracle in 1992 as Vice President of Marketing, ultimately working directly for Larry Ellison.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison,[14] founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures.[15] Other initial investors were StarVest Partners[16] ADP and UBS PaineWebber.[17] The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.[18]
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."[19]
Products[edit]
NetSuite groups its services into four main suites plus NetSuite OneWorld:[citation needed]

E-commerce - SuiteCommerce is intended as a platform for online sales and integration with traditional phone and Point of Sale (POS) tools. SuiteCommerce platform is currently in use by over 1600 websites online.[21]
Professional services automation (PSA) - NetSuite PSA manages the operations of service-based, project-oriented businesses.[22]
Human Capital Management (HCM) - NetSuite SuitePeople securely weaves people data throughout the Suite, giving businesses complete control over their Core HR & payroll processes.[23]
NetSuite OneWorld offers the above services plus additional capabilities for multinational companies such as the ability to manage multiple subsidiaries, currencies, accounting standards and tax requirements.[24]

History[edit]
NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled.[5] NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company’s 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition.[2]
In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO.  Nelson had deep background in sales and marketing, holding a variety of executive positions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.  Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp.[6]  This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite.  Nelson led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp.[7]
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Moneyball General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[8]
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007.[9] Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 [10] it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.[2]
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.[2]
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Relationship with Oracle Corporation[edit]
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.[11] Both founder Goldberg and CEO Nelson worked at Oracle Corp. prior to forming NetSuite.[12][13]  Goldberg joined Oracle immediately after graduating from Harvard College in 1987, and held a variety of positions in R&D. Nelson joined Oracle in 1992 as Vice President of Marketing, ultimately working directly for Larry Ellison.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison,[14] founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures.[15] Other initial investors were StarVest Partners[16] ADP and UBS PaineWebber.[17] The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.[18]
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."[19]
Products[edit]
NetSuite groups its services into four main suites plus NetSuite OneWorld:[citation needed]

Human Capital Management (HCM) - NetSuite SuitePeople securely weaves people data throughout the Suite, giving businesses complete control over their Core HR & payroll processes.[23]
