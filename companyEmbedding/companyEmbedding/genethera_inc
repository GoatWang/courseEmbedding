 JOHNE'S & CROHN'S DISEASE
 JOHNE'S DISEASE FACTS



GeneThera is a biotechnology company, dedicated 	to improving food safety by applying the latest molecular technologies to 	eradicate "cross over"(zoonotic) diseases such as Johne's Disease, 	Mad Cow Disease, Chronic Wasting Disease, and E.coli. Diseases of terrestrial, 	avian and aquatic life animals influence a number of economic and global 	security issues; food for an increasing world population, access to 	international trade, species conservation and protection of those endangered, 	and economic growth in developing and re-organizing nations. Because many 	animal disease agents are zoonotic (transmissible between humans and animals, 	causing infection in both species), their management and prevention are crucial 	to improving public health on a global scale.  The company focuses on 	developing molecular diagnostic tests, therapeutics, and vaccines in the belief 	that better technologies and methodology need to be implemented to help control 	emerging diseases in animals and in humans, if not these diseases in animals 	will likely continue to cause serious and growing problems in terms of 	economics, human health and biodiversity.
GeneThera’s focus is on the diagnostic and 	treatment of Johne’s disease.
Johne’s disease is a worldwide problem of 	domestic animals primarily dairy cattle, sheep and goats and a great public 	health concern Johne's disease (JD) results from infection 	with bacteria called Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. This organism grows very 	slowly, causes a gradually worsening disease condition, and is highly resistant 	to the infected animal's immune defenses. Therefore, infected animals harbor 	the organism for years before they test positive or develop disease signs.
Major Factors related to JD:


Worldwide Infection
Reduction in milk production 	to 25%+.
High culling rate which 	increases costs.
JD affects trade and hinders 	exports.
Link between JD and Crohn’s 	disease.
Reduction in quality wool 	production in sheep.
Paratuburculosis causes in 	excess $ 5 billion in economic damages worldwide to the dairy industry alone.

 JOHNE'S & CROHN'S DISEASE
 JOHNE'S DISEASE FACTS



JOHNE'S & CROHN'S DISEASE
An overwhelming number of 	studies point to a relation between Johne’s disease and Crohn’s. 80% of the 	patients with Crohn’s are positive for Mycobacterium Paratubercolosis (MAP) 	infection when examined by intestinal biopsy. (Fouad A. K. El-Zaataria, Michael S. Osatob and David Y. Graham, a 	Inflammatory Bowel Disease Laboratory, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and 	Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, 2002 Holcombe Blvd, Rm 	3A-320, Houston, TX 77030, USA)
Drinking milk from cows infected with Johne’s disease is how people are exposed 	to paratuberculosis infection. Milk is the "logical" focus of 	exposure because cows with Johne's disease secrete MAP abundantly in their 	milk. Milk studies done in Europe, among them a study from Switzerland in 2003, 	where 1,384 bulk milk samples from different regions were tested for M. 	paratuberculosis using DNA probe methods, show that 19.7 percent were 	positive for the bacteria. Intriguingly, the cows from Swiss farms were 	predominantly asymptomatic – they were apparently ill, but not producing the 	massive diarrhea that characterizes the latter stages of M. paratuberculosis infection.
In 1984 Dr. Rodrick Chiodini, at Brown University demonstrated that m. 	paratuberculosis sheds its cell wall in humans, and takes a new form, 	called a spheroblast. In a landmark study, Dr. Chiodini cultured Mycobacteria 	from children infected with Crohn's.
Further establishing the 	causative link, M. paratuberculosis isolated from Crohn's patients was 	found to cause a similar disease when fed to farm animals. It is therefore 	evident that individuals that are genetically predisposed can be contracting 	the disease through digestion of Johne’s disease –infected milk "I am 	absolutely certain that some strains of MAP can be pathogenic for humans and 	can cause Crohn's disease in susceptible people. Since MAP is known to be a 	primary specific cause of chronic inflammation of the intestine in many 	different species, including primates, it would be remarkable if it did not 	cause disease in humans."  -John Hermon-Taylor, Professor, St. 	George's Medical School, London, England and a leading world expert on Crohn's 	Disease.

 JOHNE'S & CROHN'S DISEASE
 JOHNE'S DISEASE FACTS








PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
GeneThera  provides a 	comprehensive Johne’s solution that allows to diagnose, treat and manage herds 	at risk or already infected with Johne’s disease.
Our proprietary Integrated 	Product Development Platform (IPDP)is design to prevent the spread of Johne’s 	disease to healthy animal and at the same time allow to better control the 	disease in those herds where the disease is already present.
More importantly GeneThera 	platform  prevents the spread of the Mycobacterium into the food chain. An 	important part of this strategy is GeneThera ability to detect the presence of 	a low  number of infected particles in milk tested for the presence of the 	Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis. Therefore our IPDP not only is able to 	detected  Johne’s infected animals but can also prevent potential human 	infections.
 

 
HERD GUARD
Herd Guard™ is our 	comprehensive Johne’s management solution which includes a diagnostic 	(HerdCheck™), a therapeutic (HerdSafe™), and a management system (HerdSoft™) to 	eradicate or mitigate Johne’s disease.

HERDCHECK™ (Molecular 	Test)
HerdCheck is our diagnostic 	product. Samples are collected using a 	Field Collection System with includes specific collection tubes and ship to a Genethera laboratory for processing.
The major features of the 	testing system are:

High throughput system
Capable of more than 20,000 	tests/month.
Highly defined and structured 	testing system.
Proprietary Real Time PCR 	technology


HERDSAFE™ (Genetic 	Therapy)
HerdSafe is our therapeutic 	product. HerdSafe combines an immunotherapy treatment (LIPOSTIM™) and 	large-scale purification and recombinant based DNA vaccine using Adenovirus and 	AVV genetically engineered viruses. (PURIVAX™)
 
HERDSOFT™ (Software 	Management)
HerdSoft™ is our 	comprehensive Johne’s disease management solution which is a web-based product 	connected to our data center. The management system will deliver results, 	collect data and incorporate environmental analysis to guide the client on 	therapy and management of their herd to control Johne’s disease in their 	facility.

GENETHERA SECURES NEW LABORATORY FACILITIES TO EXPAND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS




















January 25, 2016 12:33 ET

 | Source: GeneThera





WESTMINSTER, Colo., Jan. 25, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GeneThera Inc. (OTC: GTHR) announced today that it has secured a new laboratory facility. Dr. Tony Milici, CEO of GeneThera, stated; "This is an important step towards expanding our molecular robotics and DNA therapeutic vaccine platforms". The 8,000 square feet facility will be a fully integrated molecular robotics laboratory, which will house GeneThera IRSA robotic equipment to test milk products. It will also test Chron's disease to detect Mycobacterium Para tuberculosis in a highly sensitive way. In addition, we will have a "state-of-the-art" DNA vaccine laboratory fully dedicated to the development of Johne's and Chron's disease therapeutic vaccines." GeneThera is planning to move to the new laboratory facility once space renovation is completed. The projected moving date is presently scheduled for March 31st 2016.

	Mycobacterium Avium Para tuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's disease also known as Para tuberculosis. Johne's disease (JD) is a globally devastating incurable chronic inflammatory intestinal disease of dairy cow, sheep, and goats. It has been estimated that over 70% of the dairy cowherd in the US alone are infected with MAP. A large number of studies have shown a relation between JD and Crohn's disease; a severe and possibly, lethal chronic inflammatory disease of the human intestine. MAP is resistant to standard pasteurization procedures. Recent studies have also shown baby formula samples were positive for MAP infection.

About GeneThera, Inc. 

	GeneThera, Inc. is a molecular biotechnology company located in Denver, Colorado. The Company's proprietary diagnostic solution is based on a genetic expression assay, GES and Johne's disease management system, HERDCHECK, designed to function on a highly automated molecular robotics platform. This platform enables GeneThera to offer tests that are presently not available from other technologies. The GES and HERDCHECK systems are designed for a host of individual diseases, the current priority being Johne's disease.
