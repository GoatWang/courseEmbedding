VictorOps Introduces New Integration Hub
Dec 1 16
VictorOps has released its new Integration Hub and Integration Guarantee to support new and existing customers as they onboard and expand their usage of the product. Through partnerships, the Integration Hub provides a rich ecosystem that connects, extends and enhances the VictorOps solution. These integrations extend the functionality of the platform by enriching alerts within VictorOps and making the VictorOps Timeline more contextual and visual.


VictorOps Announces New Incident Creation and Routing Features Focused on Maximizing Flexibility and Resolution Efficiency
Nov 15 16
VictorOps announced a sophisticated set of features that provide ultimate flexibility and control in incident routing and resolution. VictorOps’ Manual Incident Creation and Manual Re-Routing (to an individual, team, and/or an escalation policy) make it possible to easily involve and collaborate with the right people when the ultimate goal is uptime. Aided by these features developers and operations professionals can work together as a single collaborative team, regardless of when or how the alert originated. The ability to route issues to specific domain experts for lightning-fast incident resolution is increasingly more important. Alerts are often machine-created, which can then result in floods of automated alarms—many of which are irrelevant and fail to reach the best possible responder. With this feature, users who are paged have the ability to route an existing incident to individual users, teams of users, and/or escalation policies. Rather than routing obscure, confusing alerts via email, manual incident creation provides the ability to notify the right people or teams and have them immediately focused on the incident with a single click. With this feature, users explain the parent problem and synthesize one-off, noisy alerts into a single, comprehensive incident, delivered directly to the developers and other experts who can take action. VictorOps’ Manual Incident Creation and Manual Re-Routing features are available in both Standard and Enterprise editions of the VictorOps product. They enable users to: Manually create new incidents from the web client, iOS, and Android devices; Use human generated “eventing” to give context to noisy alerts, reducing alert fatigue and quieting noise; and Route or re-route incidents to individuals, teams, escalation policies, or a combination thereof.

The Most Flexible DevOps Incident Management Platform | VictorOps















































VictorOps







Everyone's got a plan. Until they get punched in the mouth.






IT and DevOps teams are now the backbone of a company’s ability to deliver on agile’s promise of providing working software to customers quickly. Ensuring these teams not only know when there’s a problem, but have the information and tools they need to quickly solve it are essential. VictorOps is the real-time incident management platform that combines the power of people and data to embolden DevOps pros to handle incidents as they occur.
VictorOps does more than just alerting, it provides teams with a virtual environment where they can prepare for, react to and recover from each incident regardless of location or device.
It’s both real-time and thoroughly agile incident management.






How it Works



VictorOps integrates with enterprise monitoring systems (ie. Nagios, New Relic, Zabbix, Pingdom, and AppDynamics), and ingests information in order to intelligently route actionable incidents to the right team for real-time response (via SMS, email or phone call).



During an incident, teams can collaboratively troubleshoot using native chat or bi-directional integrations with Slack and HipChat.



Incoming alarms can be annotated with links to documentation from internal Wikis, runbooks, graphs (i.e. Boundary, DataDog), or links to past retrospective reports. Reports, also easily created within VictorOps, ensure teams can adapt and learn from each incident.







How We’re Different

VictorOps increases situational awareness so that collaboration and problem solving can happen in real-time. As the Swiss Army Knife of DevOps, VictorOps combines data, alerting and remediation functionality to provide a complete and live view of your system – the good, bad and ugly.


VictorOps helps you sort through the noise and get to what’s important. With functionality specific to DevOps practices and agile incident management, you can annotate incoming alerts with potential solutions and intelligently route incidents to specific team members based on the content within the alert itself.


VictorOps better mobilizes people in a virtual environment where problems can be solved in real-time as a single collaborative team, regardless of role. Your data paired with your interactions flowing through VictorOps increases communication to ensure everyone has access to the right information at the right time.










Each incident has a life of its own. Here’s how VictorOps works through each phase of the incident lifecycle to help you solve the problem faster.Learn more

Our Team | VictorOps












































VictorOps







Your team keeps the machine running. That's why we're here. 









Today every technology enabled business is 24/7. Keeping the machines running at this pace no longer affords the luxury of a nine to five workday. VictorOps was co-founded in 2012 by a team of passionate technologists that know what it’s like to be responsible for 24/7 uptime.
The VictorOps founders, Todd Vernon, Bryce Ambraziunas, and Dan Jones built the product they needed at their past companies – a better way to troubleshoot problems, get the team engaged faster and save the business money. Together they have over 30 years of DevOps experience working in the trenches to keep their companies always-on.
We’re located in the heart of downtown Boulder, where we feature views of the flatirons from our office windows and local craft beer flowing from our kegerator.





Founders



Todd Vernon
CEO / Founder
Todd started his engineering career at NASA before he realized he liked software more than hardware. Since then, Todd’s been the co-founder / CTO of Raindance Communications, helping take the company public and lead its eventual acquisition by West Corporation in 2006. After that, he was co-founder / CEO of Lijit Networks (now sovrn), which has grown into one of the largest real-time ad exchange platforms on the internet. In addition to VictorOps, Todd spends time mentoring TechStars companies and writes a startup column for Inc.
You can follow Todd on twitter @toddvernon.



Bryce Ambraziunas
COO / Founder
Bryce has spent over 17 years in the trenches developing and operating real-time communications services where “downtime just isn’t an option.” This has been Bryce’s mantra throughout his entire career, spanning various roles including Founder, COO and SVP of Operations. Most recently Bryce was the Founder and COO at Affinity VideoNet, a 24×7 videoconferencing company working with some of the most demanding customers on the planet.



Dan Jones
CTO / Founder
With almost 30 years in the software industry, Dan has spent the last 20 years architecting and building scalable 24×7 internet services designed to be “always on.” Having served as Chief Architect and VP of Engineering at two successful start-ups in this space (Raindance Communications and Lijit Networks), he is intimately familiar with what it takes to keep a business running when the slightest outage means lost revenue and unhappy customers.






Management Team



Lauren Bocci
VP of Marketing
With over a decade of experience in tech marketing and SaaS,Lauren leads a revenue focused marketing organization by generating happy customers, building a strong brand, and being joined at the hip to her product and sales counterparts. She brings a blend of solid business execution and strategic
vision to her success in marketing technology products and solutions. Previously, Lauren held positions supporting global growth and market strategy at Rally Software (now CA). There she managed the successful entry into international markets and lead marketing teams across 18 timezones.



Mark Chessler
VP of Finance
Mark has more than 20 years of experience in a variety of Finance roles. Before joining VictorOps, he spent 5 years as VP of Finance for Lijit Networks (now Sovrn), managing the Accounting and Finance functions from pre-revenue through its acquisition in 2011. Prior to Lijit Networks, Mark held a variety of Finance positions within small to mid-sized technology companies, including Director of Financial Planning and Analysis for Raindance Communications which was a NASDAQ-traded public company before being acquired in 2006.



Tom Hart
VP of OPS/Support
Tom is a passionate advocate for customer success. Having started his career as a Human Rights advocate in Northern Ireland, Tom gained advanced communication skills and the compassionate ability to resolve exceptionally challenging problems. A CU graduate, Tom joined serial entrepreneurs (and VictorOps founders) Todd Vernon, Bryce A, and Dan Jones as part of Raindance Communications, Sovrn, and now VictorOps. Outside of work, Tom is an extremely proud father of two Leprechauns, an accomplished ultra-marathon runner, a fanatical skier, a backcountry adventurer and an “all-things-mountain” advocate and enthusiast.










Dan Hopkins
VP of Engineering
Dan has worked in technology for 15 years. Many of them as an Engineer and now, recently, in an Management role. He was one of the original Engineers at VictorOps and is responsible for much of the backend code. He now happily spends his time listening to and coaching the Engineering team as well as helping to improve the SDLC.



Joni Klippert
VP of Product
Joni has helped grow VictorOps from seed-stage startup to formidable tech company, serving Fortune 500 and DevOps-oriented organizations worldwide. Passionate about solving complex problems, Joni built her product career in highly technical SaaS companies, most recently at StandingCloud (now a division of AppDirect). A regular contributor to Fortune Online on topics ranging from successful teams to brutal prioritization, Joni holds an MBA from the University of Colorado Boulder and is a frequent speaker at technology conferences. Outside of work, you can find her enjoying food and wine and spending time with her partner, Jason, and Master Q, her whippet puppy.



Brad Norris
VP of Sales
With 25 years of enterprise software experience, Brad has shaped the go-to-market and sales strategies for pioneering organizations such as Dataware Technologies, Object Design, netLibrary, Rally Software and VictorOps. Brad’s collaborative leadership approach helps build sales organizations that emphasize continuous improvement, high integrity, and sustainable growth. Prior to VictorOps, Brad ran worldwide field operations for Rally Software, the trailblazer of Agile software development philosophies that led to a successful IPO and acquisition by CA Technologies. Brad holds a bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering from The Ohio State University with a minor in Philosophy. 










Shannah Van Winkle
VP of Customer Success
While we build great technology, Shannah’s passion is ensuring every member of the VictorOps team is waking up and talking about the customer! With more than 20 years in high tech, Shannah is an accomplished leader with diverse experience leading teams and initiatives across customer success, solution selling, product, and marketing organizations. Her sweet spot is building high performing teams to solve complex problems for high growth SaaS organizations and their customers.

VictorOps: REST Endpoint - Knowledge Base

Integrations






VictorOps: REST Endpoint






Search For



Search







Contents 
 




VictorOps: REST Endpoint


The VictorOps REST Endpoint accepts alerts from any source via an HTTPS POST request in JSON format. As long as you can configure the content of the request, you can trigger, acknowledge, or resolve incidents in VictorOps.
Enable the Integration:
In VictorOps, click on Settings >> Alert Behavior >> Integrations >> Legacy REST.

If the REST endpoint integration has not been enabled, click the green Enable button to generate your endpoint destination URL.

Routing Key:
The routing key that will be used for this integration should be included in the destination URL.  It is essential that you replace what you see here with the actual routing key you intend to use.  Everything after the final forward slash must be replaced with you your key.  For example, assuming a routing_key value of “database”:
………36437/$routing_key    ==>   ……..36437/database
Routing keys in VictorOps can be set up and associated by clicking on Settings >> Alert Behavior >> Route Keys.
For more information on routing keys and best practices, click HERE.

Required / Recommended Fields:
Technically, only the message_type field is absolutely required.  You could use {“message_type”:”critical”} as the body and generate an incident.  However, in order to get the most out of the integration, we recommend including the fields listed below.  These fields help establish the workflow and lifecycle of an incident in VictorOps, but keep in mind that you can also include any number of additional, custom fields that you may find useful.



message_typeBehavior of the alert [String]

Valid values:
- CRITICAL: Triggers an incident
- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: Acks an incident
- INFO: Creates a timeline event but doesnot trigger an incident
- RECOVERY: Resolves an incident


entity_idID of the Incident [String]

This field is the identity of the incident and must remain the same throughout the life-cycle of an incident. Make sure you use the same entity_id when triggering, acking, or resolving an incident. Example: "/", i.e... "diskspace/db01.mycompany.com"

If no entity_id is included, a random string will be used.



entity_display_nameDisplay Name in the UI and Notifications [String]

This field allows you to give custom, human-friendly, summary of your incidents without affecting the life-cycle workflow. 

If you are using an entity_id value of "dskspc/db465/<0.15volumeOnDisk/this.com", a good entity_display_name might be "Disk Space is below 15% on Database Server 465. You may want to fix that"


state_messageVerbose message field [String]

 This field has a high character limit and is intended for a long, verbose, explanation of the problem. This field will be included in notifications (full content in email, truncated version in push/phone/SMS notifications) Any URL links included in this field will be rendered as clickable links in email notifications


state_start_timeTime this issue began [Number] (Linux/Unix time)

The time this entity entered its current state (seconds since epoch). Defaults to the time alert is received.



Expected Responses:
Success messages will display the result and the entity_id of the incident.
1

{
"result":"success",
"entity_id":"Your entity_id here"
}
Failure messages will display the result as well as an error message explaining the reason for the failure.

	"state_message":"The disk is really really full.  Here is abunch of information about the problem"
}
Response:
1

4
{
  "result" : "success",
  "entity_id" : "disk space/db01.mycompany.com"
}
Incident created:

Resolve an Incident:
This request will resolve the same incident opened in the example above (notice the entity_id is the same, allowing our system to identify to which incident this request should be applied)

{
	"message_type":"RECOVERY",
	"entity_id":"disk space/db01.mycompany.com",

	"state_message":"Memory was added to the disk.  All is well now"
}
Response:

{
  "result" : "success",
  "entity_id" : "disk space/db01.mycompany.com"
}
Incident Resolved:


cURL:
You can also invoke this with a cURL command by imitating this syntax (You must insert your own REST endpoint key and routing_key value):
1
curl -X POST -d {"entity_id":"ID of the incident","message_type":"critical","state_message":"hi, this is some state message."} https://alert.victorops.com/integrations/generic/20131114/alert/[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]/[ROUTING_KEY_HERE]

How does the “best price” guarantee work?
Just share evidence of your existing pricing with us and we will meet or beat the price of the comparable product you’re using today.
