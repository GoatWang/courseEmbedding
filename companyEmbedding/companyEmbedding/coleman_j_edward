 Gateway gets a new CEO--again - CNET











Gateway gets a new CEO--again
The PC maker practically changes chief executives like Italy used to swap prime ministers.
 




 




















Tech Industry






by 

Michael Kanellos

September 7, 2006 4:45 PM PDT






























 


Gateway has tapped J. Edward Coleman, a 31-year veteran of the distribution and services side of the computer business, to be its next CEO.

He is the fifth CEO (four permanent and one interim) in six years and, like his predecessors, will face the challenge of getting Gateway out of the budget end of the PC business. Although the company continues to ship PCs at a rapid rate, it has had difficulty churning out profit consistently.

During a phone interview, Coleman said he won't likely change the company's strategy in the near term, but over time will try to grow the enterprise and direct segments of the business.

He will also place more emphasis on customer service, an issue that has bedeviled Dell over the past two years.

"I come to this job with the belief that service and quality customer support (are) the key differentiators with our customers," he said. "It is a unique opportunity to lead a company that has great brand recognition and great products."


 
Coleman also noted that he's helped turn companies around before. While the CEO of CompuCom Systems in the early part of the decade, he helped turn the company from being a seller of PCs and hardware for corporations to a service provider. Many of CompuCom's competitors didn't react as quickly and faded away. After CompuCom, Coleman went to Arrow Electronics, a distributor. (Before CompuCom and Arrow, he worked at Computer Sciences Corp. and IBM.)
 
Coleman will have his work cut out for him. Over the past few years, Gateway has tried a number of different strategies--getting into consumer electronics, getting rid of its stores, selling more PCs in retail, aiming for budget customers--but it has continued stumble when it comes to profits.



The company reported a net profit during the second quarter of 2005, its first time in the black after 13 consecutive quarterly losses. It then reported profits for the next two quarters and for the the year. But so far in 2006, Gateway has lost $12.3 million in the first quarter and $7.7 million in the second quarter.



Nonetheless, the company still ships a large number of PCs. Gateway remains the third-largest PC seller in the U.S. market with a 6.2 percent market share, which is bigger than Apple Computer's. Gateway also grew shipments in the second quarter in the U.S., its main market, faster than Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Lenovo and the market as a whole, according to Gartner.



During the '90s, Gateway was one of the fastest-growing PC makers in the world. Volume shipments grew 20 to 30 percent in some quarters. Like Dell, it sold the bulk of its PCs directly to buyers, bypassing stores and integrators. 


In 1997, the company almost signed a deal to become part of Compaq, which saw direct sales as a major threat. 



Unlike Dell, however, Gateway always had difficulty selling PCs to businesses. Most of its customers were individuals or government agencies. As a result, Gateway was often stung by price cuts and the need to grow. In 1999, founder Ted Waitt stepped down as CEO and brought in Jeff Weitzen from AT&T. While Gateway grew for a while, consumers began to become angry with new, relatively stringent warranty policies.


In late 2000, Gateway was one of the first manufacturers stung by the sudden decline in demand. Subsequently, it began to close stores and lay off employees. It also retreated from international markets. 
 
Weitzen was fired in 2001 and Waitt took over again. Gateway became one of the first PC makers to move into consumer electronics. It raised eyebrows when it drastically lowered the price of plasma TVs, but the company never became a permanent rival to the likes of Samsung or Panasonic in that market. Within a few years, the company began to pare back electronics.



Then, in 2004, Gateway bought eMachines, which specialized in cut-rate PCs. Waitt subsequently resigned and turned the management of the company over to Wayne Inouye from eMachines. Inouye slashed jobs and pushed Gateway into retail. 


Inouye stepped down in February 2006. Analysts said it was his inability to move into higher-margin product categories that led to his departure.



 

Rick Snyder, board chairman, former president and CEO No. 4, came in as interim CEO.



Then, in August 2006, Lap Shun "John" Hui made an offer for $450 million cash to buy the group inside Gateway that sells PCs to retail stores. Gateway's market capitalization hovered around $725 million at the time. He was rebuffed.

After six years as CEO and chairman, Edward Coleman is leaving  Unisys Corp., effective Dec. 1.
Coleman joined the Blue Bell, Pa.-based information-technology company in October   2008, replacing Joseph W. McGrath as CEO and Henry Duques as chairman. Coleman had previously led corporate transformations and turnarounds as CEO at  Arrow Electronics,  CompuCom and  Gateway Inc. He joined Unisys in the depth of the 2008-09 financial crisis, and led a turnaround of the company, said Paul Weaver, lead independent director of the Unisys board.

“Under his leadership, Unisys strengthened its balance sheet and moved to a positive net cash position, delivered five consecutive years of profits and free cash flow, and reinvigorated its offerings, bringing to market innovative new products and services which we believe will serve as the foundation for Unisys success in the coming years,” Weaver said.





Unisys said as it focuses on its growth agenda, the board has determined “it is the right time to make a leadership change.” The board has ordered an immediate executive search firm to find Coleman’s replacement.
"It has been an honor and a privilege to lead Unisys the last six years,” Coleman said in a statement. “I am proud of our team's many accomplishments over that time. I look forward to Unisys building on its reputation for innovation, quality and customer satisfaction to create an ever stronger presence in the marketplace.”
His total compensation in 2013 was $3,896,208, according to  Forbes. 
With 700 local employees, Unisys is the  67th largest employer in the Philadelphia area.

Unisys CEO Ed Coleman Leaving Company On Heels Of Dropping Sales And Earnings

Ed Coleman



Unisys CEO Ed Coleman will be leaving as head of the solution provider, the company said Monday. The news comes on the heels of multiple quarters showing dropping revenue and earnings for the solution provider, No. 17 on CRN's SP500 list.
The changes will take effect as of Dec. 1, 2014. Coleman will remain in his positions as chairman of the board of directors and CEO until that time.
"It has been an honor and a privilege to lead Unisys the last six years. I am proud of our team's many accomplishments over that time. I look forward to Unisys building on its reputation for innovation, quality and customer satisfaction to create an ever stronger presence in the marketplace," Coleman said in a statement.
[Related: Channel Chiefs To Partners: Specialization Is Key, But You Can't Be Experts In Everything]
Unisys did not comment on the direct reason for Coleman's departure, only that it was the "right time" for a change. In response to CRN's request for additional information on the departure, a Unisys spokesperson said that Coleman was not fired and it was an "amicable parting" with Coleman's "full cooperation."
"As the company focuses on its growth agenda, the board has determined it is the right time to make a leadership change. In doing so, the board offers Ed our sincere thanks for his contributions to Unisys and its many stakeholders," Paul Weaver, lead independent director of the Unisys board, said in a statement.
Over the past few quarters, Unisys has posted dropping revenue and earnings numbers. In its most recent second-quarter earnings, reported at the end of July, the solution provider posted a loss of $12.1 million, with revenues dropping 6 percent to $806 million over the year before. The quarter before, Unisys posted even greater earnings losses of $53.5 million, following up on a loss of $33.9 million in the same quarter last year. Revenues were down 6 percent year-over-year to $762 million.
Since the beginning of 2012, Unisys has only posted gains in three quarterly reports, with seven quarters showing significant losses in earnings.
Despite these factors, Weaver said in a statement that Coleman's leadership has strengthened the company's balance sheet and cash position. He said that Coleman helped lead a turnaround, including new offerings, products and services that he said will "serve as the foundation for Unisys' success in the coming years."
Coleman came to Unisys in October of 2008, replacing former CEO Joseph McGrath. At the time, the company had been seeing declining revenues, and shareholders had been pushing for a company turnaround. Coleman was praised at the time as a turnaround specialist, fresh off the heels of a Gateway Computer revamping before its sale to Acer in 2007 for $710 million.
Coleman was also well known in the channel as the former CEO and chairman of CompuCom, a position he held for five years, as well as the senior vice president and president of Arrow Electronics' Enterprise Computing Solutions division. Near the beginning of his career, he spent 17 years at IBM.
	 
	Unisys said that it will immediately begin looking for a replacement for Coleman, with the board of directors engaging executive search firm Russell Reynolds, though it did not say if there were any particular targets at this time.

	"We are looking for a leader who will execute on the company's growth agenda," a Unisys spokesperson told CRN.

	Unisys said that it could not say what Coleman's next move would be, but that he will remain focused on leading the company for the remainder of his term there.

      J. Edward Coleman - Seasoned Technology Executive and Accomplished 
      Transformation Leader - Named Chief Executive Officer of Gateway
    







September 07, 2006 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Gateway, Inc. (NYSE: GTW) Board of Directors today announced the 
      appointment of J. Edward Coleman, 54, as chief executive officer. 
      Coleman replaces Rick Snyder, who has served as interim CEO since 
      February and will remain Chairman of Gateway's Board of Directors.
    


      A 30-year veteran of the technology industry, Coleman's broad-based 
      experience includes sales and marketing, operations, IT services and 
      finance roles with some of the world's most successful technology 
      companies. He has a proven record of helping companies to identify new 
      growth opportunities and the strategies needed to capture this growth. 
      As CEO and Chairman of CompuCom, Coleman successfully transformed the 
      company's model to a services-led business from its PC reseller legacy, 
      an achievement that led to Coleman being named one of Computer Reseller 
      News' "Top 25 Executives" in 2003 and the recipient of the VARBusiness 
      500 "Lifetime Achievement Award" in 2004.
    

      "On behalf of the Board, we are extremely pleased to have a proven 
      leader with strong experience in leading and transforming a public 
      company in the IT industry," Snyder said. "In recent months we've made 
      great strides to stabilize our overall business. Under Ed's leadership, 
      we expect to accelerate the development and execution of the strategic 
      plans for our Professional and Direct businesses, while at the same time 
      continuing to grow our successful Retail and International operations."
    

      "Joining Gateway at this critical juncture in its storied 21-year 
      history is a tremendous opportunity," said Coleman. "Gateway is one of 
      the most recognizable brands in technology. I look forward to working 
      with Gateway's employees and stakeholders to meet the challenges ahead 
      and position the company to better capitalize on its strengths."
    

      Coleman joins Gateway from Arrow Electronics, Inc., a major global 
      provider of products, services and solutions to industrial and 
      commercial users of electronic components and computer products, where 
      he served as senior vice president and president, Arrow Enterprise 
      Computing Solutions. Previously, he led CompuCom Systems, Inc., a $1.4 
      billion IT services and solutions provider headquartered in Dallas, 
      Texas, serving as CEO from December 1999 until November 2004 and as 
      Chairman from 2001 to 2004. Prior to joining CompuCom, Coleman served in 
      various leadership roles at Computer Sciences Corporation, where he was 
      instrumental in growing the IT outsourcing business and integrating the 
      company's outsourcing, systems integration and management consulting 
      capabilities. Coleman spent 17 years at IBM in various executive 
      positions, including head of IBM Credit's used equipment and channel 
      financing businesses, and led New Jersey-based integrator MTS from 1993 
      to 1995. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the College of 
      William and Mary, and holds a master's degree in business 
      administration/marketing from Indiana University.
    

      As Chairman, Snyder will work closely with Coleman and the leadership 
      team to ensure a smooth transition. Coleman will assume his new role on 
      September 18 and join Gateway's Board of Directors.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them. And if you ever want a place to discuss your passions, your knowledge, or your warnings about products, our forum is one of the more comprehensive places to do it.

So don’t take our word for it, check it out for yourself and see everything eReplacementParts.com has to offer.

						What Our Loyal Customers Have To Say					

						Just a short note to say thanks for the information and parts you provide. I have been able to resurrect and maintain a wide variety of tools thanks to the schematics and amazing array of parts you can supply.					

						Chris D.					

						Maryland, USA					


					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.
