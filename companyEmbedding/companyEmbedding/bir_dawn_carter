Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Appoints Dawn Carter Bir as Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer











IRVING, Texas, Oct.  11, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RETA) (“Reata” or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the appointment of Dawn Carter Bir as Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.
Ms. Bir joins the company with over 20 years of biopharmaceutical sales and marketing experience.  Over the past decade she served in senior leadership roles at Pharmacyclics, LLC, McKesson Corporation, and Genentech, Inc.  Most recently, Ms. Bir served as Vice President of US Sales at Pharmacyclics, LLC where she built and led their first hematology national sales organization of sales representatives, division managers, and regional sales directors, responsible for the launch of IMBRUVICA in the US and Puerto Rico.  In only 18 months, her team became an industry-recognized commercial sales presence and executed a history-making oncology launch.  Prior to joining Pharmacyclics, LLC, Dawn served as Vice President Sales & Marketing with McKesson US Pharmaceutical, SKY Pharmaceuticals, and RxPak. “We are pleased to welcome Dawn to the role of Chief Commercial Officer,” said Warren Huff, Reata’s Chief Executive Officer and President.  “Dawn is an experienced executive with a proven ability to build and lead sales and marketing organizations.  She is also ideally suited to orchestrate our anticipated product launches and collaborate effectively with our global commercial partners.” Ms. Bir received a B.S. in Biology from Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY. About Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops novel therapeutics for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases by targeting molecular pathways involved in the regulation of cellular energy production and inflammation.  Our two most advanced clinical candidates (bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone) target important transcription factors, called Nrf2 and NF-κB, to restore mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and resolve inflammation. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes certain disclosures which contain “forward-looking statements,” including, without limitation, statements regarding the success, cost and timing of our product development activities and clinical trials, our plans to research, develop and commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to obtain and retain regulatory approval of our product candidates. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “will,” “may,” “aims,” “plans” and “expects.” Forward-looking statements are based on Reata’s current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in Reata’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended from time to time, under the caption “Risk Factors.”  The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and, other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.

Students may be eligible for a tax exemption on textbooks in some states. Learn More.
