NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES and LONDON, April 11, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Brand Media & Marketing Group, Inc. (OTCQB: DBMM)
An 8-K was filed today to post disclosure as required of a public company which has undergone either a name change and/or a reverse split to make an announcement to the public when FINRA concludes approval of the reorganization.
Digital Brand Media and Marketing Group, Inc received approval for its name change and DBMM ticker symbol from FINRA effective April 8, 2013. The action is the final documentation required in order to operate in all matters under the new name and trade under the new symbol. 
The Amendment for the name change was filed with the State of Florida on March 5, 2013 coincident with the effective date of the Company's reverse split, and filed by the State on its website on March 20, 2013.
As stated in the 8-K, upon effect of the Reverse Split, the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased to 9,052,943 effective March 5, 2013. The 10-Q being prepared for the 2nd Quarter will reflect all of the approved actions above in its financial reporting.
In summary, following the reorganization which took several months, through all of the regulatory requirements, the Company is now in the best position it has ever been in terms of its financial structure and its business development progression.
"Search and Social Media are now an integral part of not only society in general but within the fabric of what businesses do every day," said Reggie James, Co-Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Marketing and Communications. "The introduction of Twitter into the Bloomberg trading platform is a testament to the reliance Wall Street now has on Social Networks." James added, "With over 30 trillion websites indexed by Google, Brands are investing heavily to enhance their position in an increasingly competitive and complex market. The need to understand customers in an era of big data is a key driver for many companies and DBMM's experience in this market paves the way to develop strong relationships and drive revenue."
