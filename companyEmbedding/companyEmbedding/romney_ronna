Ronna Romney (born Ronna Eileen Stern; September 24, 1943) is a Michigan Republican politician and radio talk show host.
Life and career[edit]
Romney was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Eileen Boyd and James Albert Stern.[1] She has twice been a candidate for the U.S. Senate. In 1994, she narrowly lost the primary to Spencer Abraham; in 1996, she defeated party favorite Jim Nicholson to win the Republican nomination, but lost the general election to incumbent Senator Carl Levin.
From 1984 to 1992, she was a member of the Republican National Committee from Michigan; she was an alternate delegate to the 1988 Republican National Convention.[2]
From 1989 to 1993, she served as Chairperson of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. From 1982 to 1985, she served as Commissioner of the Presidents' National Advisory Council on Adult Education. Romney has been on the Board of Directors of Molina Healthcare since 1999. She has also served on the Board of Directors for Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. since 1999. She is the author of two books: MOMENTUM: Women in American Politics Now (1988), and Giving Time a Chance: The Secret of a Lasting Marriage (2015, with Beppie Harrison).[3]
The sister of anti-obscenity activist Terry Rakolta, Ronna Romney was married to G. Scott Romney, brother of former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. She is the former daughter-in-law of Michigan Governor George Romney and his wife Lenore Romney. Her daughter Ronna Romney McDaniel was elected as Michigan's Republican National Committeewoman in February 2014 and chair of the Republican National Committee in 2017.
Now living in Florida, she supported her ex-husband Scott in his unsuccessful 1998 primary race for Attorney General of Michigan in 1998. She remains a close friend of Ann Romney and helped raise money for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.[4]

RNC elects Ronna Romney McDaniel as chair

	                        August 28, 2012: Scott Romney, brother of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, applauds with his daughter Ronna during the second day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida.
	                        
	                        	 (Reuters)
	                        
	                    



The Republican National Committee elected Ronna Romney McDaniel Thursday to serve as its chairwoman – making her the first female RNC chief in three decades.
McDaniel, President-elect Donald Trump’s preferred candidate, previously served as the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and played a key role in delivering the state by a thin margin to Trump in the November election.
McDaniel, 43, is the niece of 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and earned favor with Trump by supporting him despite a feud earlier this year between her uncle and the now-president elect.
"I am a mom from Michigan," she said. "I am an outsider. And I am going to do everything I can to make sure Donald Trump and Republicans everywhere are successful."
McDaniel was elected by RNC members gathered in the nation’s capital, and takes over from outgoing chairman Reince Priebus, who had served in the role for six years. Priebus is moving to the Trump White House where he will serve as chief of staff.
Priebus gave McDaniel a strong endorsement in his final address to the committee, calling McDaniel “the right woman to lead the RNC" and pointed to her ability to turn Michigan red in the election.
"It is that level of passion, along with her commitment to building out the ground, data, and digital operation the RNC has been working on for years, that gives me total confidence she is the right woman to lead the RNC," he said.
Congratulations to @RRMGOP, the new Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee! pic.twitter.com/xfM5CmqGxu— GOP (@GOP) January 19, 2017

Massachusetts GOP chair Kirsten Hughes said McDaniel’s election is part of “an honest effort” to improve the party’s standing with women. After the 2012 presidential election defeat, the RNC’s now famous “autopsy” encouraged the party to “grow the ranks of influential female voices in the Republican Party."
McDaniel herself indicated that her election could play a role in breaking down the Democratic Party’s claim to be the party of women.
"For far too long, Democrats have hailed themselves as the party of women," McDaniel said. "As Republicans, we know their so-called monopoly on being the party of women is false, and it is a mindset I intend to change."
McDaniel is expected to play a behind-the-scenes role, with a special focus on fundraising and maintaining the national field and data operation built by Priebus’ team.  She will work with new Co-Chair Bob Paduchik, who was Trump's state director in Ohio.

Can Ronna Romney McDaniel unite a fractured Republican Party?

                            WASHINGTON
                        


 On the night before the election, Pete Hoekstra stood onstage at a Michigan convention center, introducing the lineup of speakers at Donald Trump’s final rally of the campaign. 
The former congressman welcomed a professor to the podium for the Pledge of Allegiance, then a GOP county chair. But the next speaker required something of a caveat.
“She’s got a special name,” he acknowledged. “Some of you may be surprised. But we love her. Ronna” — his voice dropped conspiratorially — “Romney” — it rose again — “McDaniel.”
Out strode the then-chair of the Michigan GOP, who demanded of the rowdy crowd, “Are you ready to talk to your friends and your family, so we can make America great again?”
McDaniel, now the newly elected chair of the Republican National Committee, knows something about talking Trump with family. She publicly bucked her own famous family members — particularly Uncle Mitt — and much of the Michigan old guard with her early and enthusiastic backing of Trump, embracing the grass-roots energy that fueled his campaign while attempting to corral support from the skeptical GOP establishment. 




Ronna Romney McDaniel is the second female chair of the Republican National Committee in history
In her first major interview with a national print news organization as RNC chair, she addressed her challenge of balancing a Trump-adoring grass roots that is more loyal to him than to the Republican brand with the more traditional GOP establishment, whose support, money and talent she will need to hold on to the party’s congressional majorities in 2018.
“We have to keep this new coalition of Trump voters engaged. And they represent Democrats, more independents and people who hadn’t voted for a long time because they lost their faith in government,” she said in an interview with McClatchy.
The first step is to highlight economic promises on which Trump is delivering — like pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
“We’ve got to help share that message with those voters and then turn them into Republicans, so they support candidates aside from President Trump,” she said. “That’s going to be something we’re going to be focusing on the next two years.”



As she works toward that goal while attempting to re-engage Trump-skeptical suburban Republicans by stressing economic issues and the Supreme Court, the broader GOP effort will get a boost from Trump himself: “President Trump has committed that he is going to work to elect Republicans across the board in the midterms. He’s supportive of the RNC,” she said.
Amid preparation for the midterms and planning for 2020, the test for any RNC chair is “always trying to keep people feeling united, even when they disagree,” said Jennifer Horn, a former New Hampshire GOP chair who has worked with McDaniel and is a fan. “There’s the good and the bad, and her job is going to be to keep the party growing in the same direction regardless.”
A family balancing act 
McDaniel, the second female RNC chair in history, has had a foothold in both the grass roots and the establishment camps of the GOP from her earliest days in Republican politics.
She grew up next door to her grandfather, the late George Romney, a former governor of Michigan and a giant in Michigan GOP circles who made the Romney name synonymous with “establishment.” At a recent dinner at Sonoma, a trendy wine bar and restaurant on Capitol Hill, McDaniel regaled RNC members with stories about her grandfather, and the lessons he’d taught her about fiscal responsibility and love of country.

But McDaniel, 43, has also been shaped by the more populist politics of her mother, Ronna Romney, who worked as a conservative talk-radio host and twice ran for the Senate unsuccessfully. During her 1994 primary effort, Ronna Romney was mentioned in the same stories as firebrand radio host Rush Limbaugh, and she told The New York Times that “I am the voice of the frustrated American.”
“There are some people who consider Ronna Romney senior the original tea party person in Michigan,” said Stu Sandler, a longtime GOP operative in Michigan who has worked with McDaniel. “Ronna Romney senior — very conservative, very outsider, really considered the anti-establishment, and it got Ronna junior a lot of support when she ran for state chair. The first time people remembered her mother, saw her daughter’s political beliefs, they said, ‘This is a new generation of conservative leadership.’ ”
My Uncle Mitt and I felt a little different about this election, and we spoke about that privately, but it’s family and not all families agree in politics. Ronna Romney McDaniel
McDaniel, whom some longtime Michigan politicos still remember as “Little Ronna,” served as her mother’s driver during that 1994 campaign — her first job in politics. The race divided the Romney clan: Ronna Romney was supported by Mitt Romney but did not receive the endorsement of George Romney, who at that point was her ex-father-in-law (he cited previous commitments to her opponent, Spencer Abraham, who later won).
McDaniel named both her mother and her grandfather as her political influences in a 2015 interview, though she dismissed the idea that there were significant ideological differences between the two in her interview with McClatchy.
She downplayed those differences as they might relate to herself too. “I’m a Republican; I’d say I’m a conservative Republican. My job as RNC chair is to elect Republicans all across this country.”
McDaniel, who is Mormon, graduated from Brigham Young University and worked for a time at a Washington-area political media firm before settling in suburban Detroit with her husband, insurance executive Patrick McDaniel, and their two young children. 
She rose to political prominence in 2012, when she spearheaded a “Women for Mitt” effort on her uncle’s behalf in Michigan. From there, McDaniel’s political career took off: She was elected Michigan Republican national committeewoman in 2014, and in 2015 she won the state party chairmanship. She developed a reputation for getting along well with the donor class while prioritizing engagement of the conservative grass roots.
McDaniel is personable, fair-minded and hardworking, say people who have dealt with her. She is also deeply loyal to the party — a commitment that was put under severe strain by Donald Trump.
The Trump test 
McDaniel, like other party chairs, was neutral in the GOP primary. But she quickly understood Trump’s potential in Michigan, even as her uncle became one of the country’s foremost Trump critics. As Mitt Romney was calling Trump a “fraud” and a “phony,” McDaniel was preparing for a major push to unite her party around the GOP nominee.
“She spent a lot of time with the donor community, which was not very excited, initially, for President Trump,” said Greg McNeilly, a Michigan GOP operative who has advised McDaniel.
Many of them, who had been devoted Mitt Romney supporters, agreed with his assessment of the bombastic presidential candidate. McDaniel heard them out.
“A lot of it was patiently just letting them vent, and then as they would get that out of the system, she would start to point out things he was doing or saying that they’d agree with, or policies he was adopting that were in line with their views,” McNeilly said. “It was a very tailored approach. She must have worked to convert hundreds of donors and key activists to at least being neutral.”
She tapped a network of Michigan GOP power brokers who were out of reach for the scrappy, grass-roots-oriented Trump acolytes focused on the blue-collar voters who had few ties to the Republican Party.
“Being a Romney, being involved in Romney’s presidential campaign, being related to some of these people, her experience and connections were very, very helpful,” said Scott Hagerstrom, who was Trump’s Michigan state director.
By virtue of being a Romney, she also faced — and still faces, to some extent — skepticism from Trump loyalists over her commitment to helping him and his movement. Yet toward the end of the campaign, McDaniel made clear that she had run out of patience with party officials who were still voicing opposition to Trump: She ousted Wendy Day, a grass-roots vice chair of the state GOP and an outspoken Trump critic.
“There were a lot of people that were looking to her, because of her family name, to see how she would handle a situation like that; would she be weak on it,” said Katie Packer, Mitt Romney’s 2012 deputy campaign manager, who has deep ties to Michigan and was herself a strong Trump critic but a big fan of McDaniel’s. “She was very, very committed to Trump as the nominee of the party.”
It wasn’t always easy.
“Family means a lot to her, and I know she took pressure from her family,” said Hoekstra, adding, “She didn’t dwell on it, it was kind of like . . . ‘No bitterness, but hey, on this one, in my family we’ve got a split. I’ve got a job to do; I’m going to go do it.’ ”
Asked about those disagreements, McDaniel replied, “My Uncle Mitt and I felt a little different about this election, and we spoke about that privately, but it’s family and not all families agree in politics. I think that’s pretty normal and something a lot of people can relate to, especially this election.”
Ronna is very much her own person. Katie Packer, Mitt Romney’s 2012 deputy campaign manager
Mitt Romney was also among the first to email McDaniel with congratulations and offers to help however he could after she accepted the RNC job, she said. Asked how he could do that, she replied, “All Republicans in our party, anyone who’s held a nomination or been leaders in the party, can help us elect Republicans across this country, campaign, be a surrogate, help share our message.”
During the campaign, however, the stress of that dynamic sometimes spilled out into the open, as Trump supporters vilified Mitt Romney for his harsh criticisms of the candidate.
At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Michigan’s delegation was asked to hold back on casting its votes for Trump in order to allow New York, Trump’s home state, to put him over the top in the delegate total. When it appeared that only Michigan had been asked to stand down, McDaniel said, in earshot of reporters, “It feels like a Romney thing.” 
She later retracted the remark, but she emphasized her maiden name when she ultimately cast Michigan’s votes: “My name is Ronna Romney McDaniel, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party,” she said as she cast the bulk of her state’s votes for Trump.
Building the Ronna brand 
In Washington these days, she more often goes simply by Ronna McDaniel. The RNC news release announcing her new position did not reference “Romney.” Emails and letters that she has circulated in Republican circles are often signed “Ronna McDaniel,” a break from the political brand she established in Michigan (The names are “interchangeable,” she said. “Everyone can just call me Ronna.”).
But she has an opportunity now to build a new brand, because she was relatively unknown to many on the Republican National Committee as she started her chairmanship this year.
Rob Gleason, who served for a decade as the chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party before stepping down after the election, noted that McDaniel has served for only a short stretch of time on the national committee.
“In that period of time, I didn’t get to know her. A lot of people don’t know her,” he said.
McDaniel has several big things going for her, however, as she seeks to win over the trust and confidence of these influential Republican activists.
They know she helped oversee Trump’s Michigan win, the first victory by a Republican presidential candidate in that state since 1988. She has already proved to be a strong fundraiser. And most importantly, she has the backing of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the former RNC chair who is near-universally beloved by the 168 members of the committee.
She will need full RNC support heading into several intense years, as she works to keep Republican majorities in the 2018 midterm elections and to ready the party for the 2020 presidential re-election campaign.
She very naturally connects with a lot of people who we need to get and keep on board. Henry Barbour, GOP national committeeman, Mississippi
As part of that effort, several people who have spoken with her say she is aware of the need to re-engage those Republicans who followed in her uncle’s footsteps and did not vote for Trump.
Pressed for specifics about how to do that, she suggested Republicans should be highlighting developments like Trump’s nomination of conservative Neil Gorsuch to be a Supreme Court justice, as well as Trump’s efforts to roll back regulations and kick-start the Keystone XL Pipeline.
She added that continued investments in the RNC ground game will help officials communicate about consensus Republican achievements in Washington to moderate, affluent Republicans around the country —the same approach she took to Trump skeptics in Michigan.
“I’m a suburban mom. I grew up in Oakland County, Michigan. These are people I know well; this is my community,” she said, adding that she has seen more of them warm to Trump since his election.
Henry Barbour, the influential Republican national committeeman from Mississippi, said McDaniel was in a good position to make the case to moderate suburban voters as well as to the Rust Belt Trump supporters who backed the president but didn’t typically vote Republican.
“She very naturally connects with a lot of people who we need to get and keep on board,” he said. “Those are people in the Midwest, and I think those are suburbanite-type voters.”
For McDaniel, it’s the latest balancing act in a political life full of them. And in Washington, away from the legacies and reputations of the rest of her famous family, she’ll be handling this one on her own.
“Ronna is very much her own person,” Packer said. “She’s close with her family — she loves her family — she’s got her own values and own mind. She is just her own person.”

Ronna Romney McDaniel (born January 19, 1973) is an American political operative. A member of the Republican Party, she is the current chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party. A third generation politician, McDaniel is the granddaughter of George W. Romney and the niece of Mitt Romney.
Background[edit]
She is the third of five children born to Ronna Stern Romney and Scott Romney, the brother of Mitt Romney. She attended Lahser High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan,[1] and Brigham Young University.[2]
McDaniel and her husband, Patrick McDaniel, have two children.[1] They live in Northville, Michigan.[2]
Career[edit]
McDaniel worked for SRCP Media as a production manager. She also worked for the production company Mills James as a business manager and as a manager at the staffing firm Ajilon.[3]
McDaniel worked in Michigan for her uncle Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign for President of the United States. She was elected Michigan's representative to the Republican National Committee (RNC) in 2014.[3]
In 2015, McDaniel ran for chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, receiving support from both the party establishment and Tea Party activists. At the party's convention in February, she defeated Norm Hughes and Kim Shmina, receiving 55% of the vote in the first ballot. She succeeded Bobby Schostak as chairwoman and stepped down from her position at the RNC.[4][3]
During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, McDaniel served as a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention for Donald Trump.[4] Following the 2016 presidential election, McDaniel became a candidate to chair the Republican National Committee.[5]
On November 13, 2016, Reince Priebus, chairman of the RNC, was announced as the new White House Chief of Staff, thereby turning the RNC chairman election into an open seat election. Soon afterward, several candidates were reported as likely to seek the position, including McDaniel.[6] On December 14, 2016, McDaniel was chosen by then President-elect Trump as his recommendation to replace Priebus.[7] She was officially elected as RNC Chairwoman on January 19, becoming the second woman to hold the post in RNC history after Mary Louise Smith.[8]

Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney would be "great in any role," but it will be up to him to decide on whether he'll eventually seek Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch's seat, his niece and newly elected Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said Wednesday.
"I haven't talked to my Uncle Mitt about it," McDaniel told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" in her first interview since being selected to replace Reince Priebus, who is now President Donald Trump's chief of staff.
Hatch has been a great senator for Utah, McDaniel said, noting that her husband's first job was with the veteran senator, and it will be up to Hatch and Romney to decide what their next steps will be.
Earlier this week, Romney said he doesn't have any predictions about what he will do, but "all doors are open." Hatch, 82, was first elected in 1976 and has not said yet if he'll seek re-election. Several other potential candidates, including former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., have also been mentioned.
"I'm not looking forward to anything political at the national level," Romney said. "We've got some races coming up here in Utah that are going to be interesting. We'll see what happens on that front."
Meanwhile, Republicans have a "great opportunity" for the Senate in 2018, McDaniel said, especially considering Democrats are "obstructing every possible thing the president puts forward" and "keeping him from putting cabinet members in place."
"Now they are threatening to filibuster the Supreme Court [Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch]," said McDaniel. "So now, we're going to go to the Senate map in 2018 and say guess what? We need to get the 60 seats so we don't have to deal with this anymore and government can function."
McDaniel also spoke out against a comment made by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who said the "future is female," after women organized a march after Trump's inauguration that brought millions of protesters into the streets.
"The future is female right now in the Republican Party," said McDaniel. "Kellyanne Conway just ran the first successful presidential race in history as a woman. I am the second woman ever to lead the Republican National Committee. I'm glad Hillary Clinton is taking notice."
The RNC wants even more women to become engaged, McDaniel continued, and plans to reach out to them.
"In the end, you want the best candidate to lead and Donald Trump is always looking for the best qualified person," said McDaniel.

Life and career[edit]
Romney was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Eileen Boyd and James Albert Stern.[1] She has twice been a candidate for the U.S. Senate.

From 1984 to 1992, she was a member of the Republican National Committee from Michigan; she was an alternate delegate to the 1988 Republican National Convention.[2]
From 1989 to 1993, she served as Chairperson of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. From 1982 to 1985, she served as Commissioner of the Presidents' National Advisory Council on Adult Education. Romney has been on the Board of Directors of Molina Healthcare since 1999. She has also served on the Board of Directors for Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. since 1999. She is the author of two books: MOMENTUM: Women in American Politics Now (1988), and Giving Time a Chance: The Secret of a Lasting Marriage (2015, with Beppie Harrison).[3]
The sister of anti-obscenity activist Terry Rakolta, Ronna Romney was married to G. Scott Romney, brother of former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. She is the former daughter-in-law of Michigan Governor George Romney and his wife Lenore Romney. Her daughter Ronna Romney McDaniel was elected as Michigan's Republican National Committeewoman in February 2014 and chair of the Republican National Committee in 2017.
Now living in Florida, she supported her ex-husband Scott in his unsuccessful 1998 primary race for Attorney General of Michigan in 1998. She remains a close friend of Ann Romney and helped raise money for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
