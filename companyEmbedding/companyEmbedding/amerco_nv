Finally I have found an auto repair place with honest automotive technicians. As a woman and a car owner for over 45 years, I have been ripped off by numerous mechanics all over America. At Val Halla Automotive Service, I receive quality service at a reasonable price. They have never tacked on additional costs and, rather than suggesting repairs, Dan Olsen just tells me what he can do and lets me decide.They do a great job, right the first time, and usually it was done expeditiously. Dan runs a honest business (his dad was an honest logger) and he is always concerned about his customers needs. I simply would not go anywhere else to have my PT Cruiser serviced.Val Halla's not much to look at - a one chair waiting room and a framed photo of Clark Gable, circa 1940 on the wall - because Dan and his crew care more about cars than decor. Dan has always been honest about what needs to be done, what could wait until later, and he has given me a fair price. After stopping in just once looking for a place that would service my 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser, I left feeling that my car was in great hands, and I wasn't disappointed. Overall, Val Halla provides high quality service for a reasonable price. And they're really nice too.  For those reasons, I will continue to bring all of my car repair business to them.“An auto repair facility you can trust.” I never thought I would utter that phrase. What I love most about Val Halla is that I can trust them. They don't "sell" parts, in fact, with my older vehicle, there are times when Dan has advised me to skip a repair because it’s too expensive. I have always been kept informed during the course of repairs and have always been happy with their service. It's nice to know that there is an auto repair business on Gentry Way in Reno that provides honest service. His technicians are all highly qualified; they know what they are doing. If you love your car, it's in good hands here!If you want it done right the first time, Val Halla is your place. I had an air conditioning problem with my car and spoke to three local repair shops. I said I wanted a Freon recharge but wanted NO air conditioning check. (That’s because I have a failed $500 fan and I can’t afford the repair.) One place quoted me $125, the other quote was $135, and Val Hall quoted me $40. (It ended up costing $40.15 but Dan blew off the 15-cents.) Val Halla diagnosed the problem quickly, did the repairs for exactly what I was quoted (pus 15 cents) and I am now able to drive around Reno with blessed air! Great Service. When the Chrysler dealership closed its doors, I was very pleased to learn that Val Halla had a mechanic whose family owns three PT Cruisers. I am a female who drives a lot. I need reliable transportation and can't afford to have my car tied up for long periods of time. Dan Olsen is an honest businessman who treats his customers well. I would not go anywhere else as I have found a gem in Val Halla Auto Repair.Deano's AutomotiveRon C. ratedMy wife and I were visiting Reno for a few days, from San Jose.  On day 3 of our trip, the starter went out on my GMC Envoy and I was stranded in a casino parking lot.  On the recommendation of our cabbie that night, I had the car towed the next morning to Deano's and told them we were planning to drive back home that day and hoped it could be fixed in time. I then asked for the number of a cab company so I could get a ride back to the hotel.  The young man who helped me (Dusty), promptly said he'd give me a ride... really??  I gratefully accepted.  When he dropped me off, he said he would call after lunch and give me an update.Sure enough, just about 1pm I received a call from the shop. I was a little anxious about what Dusty was going to say.  To my pleasant surprise he said the car was finished!  He then said to meet him at the valet entry with our bags as he was coming to pick us up!  Again...REALLY???  We went back to the shop, paid what I thought was a very fair bill and we were on our way home.I was truly amazed at the extra care and concern we recieved.  They all went out of their way to make sure our needs were met.  This is truly a rare quality found in the auto repair business today.  I will make sure that all those I know who are traveling to Reno are aware of this family owned business, if they are ever in need of an auto repair.  Special kudos to Dusty, who was our personal chauffer:)  A bad day was brightened by your kind acts. Ray's tire exchangesomeone82 ratedI had 4 old tires on my car from Les Schawb.  Les Schawb is a great tire store but I didn't have the money at the time to replace all the tires.  I had 3 decent tires and one worn tire that was about to blow and was a safety hazzard.  So I checked around and the best deal around was at Ray's Tire exchange.  For less than $50.00, I could get one used tire installed and balanced on my car.  So I went for that deal.  The problem was that they accidently installed the wrong size tire.  The tire was the same rim size but it was larger in circumferance than the rest of the tires I had on the car.   If you do that on a drive wheel you can mess up your transmission or differential.  Luckly it was not on a drive wheel.   I went back the next day anyway and asked for an exchange.   They gave me some hassel for a while and suggested that I had come in with a different tire than the one they had installed yesterday.  I explained that it was no big deal and I just wanted to exchange the tire for one that is the same size as the rest of the tires on my car.  Eventually they did exchange the wrong sized tire for one that was the right size, although they did it kind of reluctantly.So my advice is if your looking for a cheap tire inbetween full replacements, try Ray's tire.  Keep an eye on them though.  Inspect the tire before they put it on and make sure that it is the right size and a tire that will work for you.  It will save you hassel later.All About CarsElise C. ratedMy experience started with a call, answered by Angel, about a coupon for my daughter's oil changes.  His customer service skills were amazing and boom--my daughter was scheduled for a service.  Wow.  My daughter was really pleased with the shop and all the staff.When my AC went out on my almost 20 year old car, I got talked into going to another local shop. After hearing great spiels, and waiting for almost two hours, the price was crazy.  My daughter said, "call Angel!"  I ended up at the All About Cars for an estimate.  The price was very reasonable, especially for original Honda parts. Jason and Angel were really patient with all my questions and we're happy to provide clear explanations of the parts, process, and costs involved.All About Cars was so nice and gave me a card with several free services to say, "thanks" for being a new customer.  Wow yet again.My car is so grateful for All About Cars quality, professional care.All About CarsSydney G. ratedI could not wait to come on here and say how much I absolutely adore this place!! I bought a 2004 Jetta from a car lot, 2 months later I find out it needs a transmission and just the transmission is 3,000 (and my warrantee covered only $3,000) I could not find a shop in town to replace it without costing me thousands of dollars out of pocket. (Plus it needed new breaks too) I brought it to all about car's and told them my situation (crying at the time by the way). Joe said he would personally take care of the situation and let me know. He called me 2 days later and told me he was going to make it work for the budget I had, and that the most he would go over was $300 and he would replace the breaks included in that price. I was so relieved!!!!!! And he said he would have it all done and ready by Saturday (And today is Thursday) These guys are the best!!!! Total life savor I will never ever go anywhere else.Sierra Automotive Repairrandy.ralston.54 ratedI have no idea who/why/what/how these other two reviewers had a bad experience.  I am not even sure of the truth of it.  This shop is one of the best repair shops I have been to in over 50 years.  They have helped some of my employees get AFFORDABLE repairs on clunkers - on two occasions allowing them to keep the car (rather than junking) and in one case still have a car.  They do excellent repair work and cost less than many others and always less than a dealer.  These guys are great.  Now, for these two other reviewers - they are the bozos and their complaints make them look foolish at best.  So try Sierra Automotive.  They do superior work always.  On second thought, they are only OK.  No need to keep them too busy.  I do not want to delay my repairs and auto work. I like their fast service.  Perhaps only go their occasionally - so they have enough business, but can still give me fast service!!  :-)  North Valley AutomotiveC J. ratedOutstanding group of guys!!Long story short....My family and I were heading back to Grants Pass, Oregon from Reno on a late Friday afternoon. Suddenly the temperature gauge pegged on High. We slowly got off the freeway and saw an  AutoZone. They recommended North Valley Automotive a mile down the road. Brent Tolley "owner" stopped what he was doing and found our water pump had failed. He worked on the vehicle until it was back online. Just after his closing time on a Friday we were on our way home. It was one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for us. I highly recommend North Valley Automotive. Great honest prices too! If you live around Reno,go there you won't be disappointed. Thanks Guys!!All About Carsmccollchristy ratedAfter an exhausting search for...After an exhausting search for the best price I ran into a starting Automotive Business Called All About Cars.  This young man "Joe" was very professional and provided me with ultimate respect and great honest and affordable place.  My grandson pays for my auto repair and since he's out of town, he could not believe the price that was given to me.  I guess I found a great deal here at All About Cars.  I don't know any better on what was wrong but my grandson Jason, came up from Sacramento to meet the manager and paid in person because he could not believe the cost.  He was so thankful his wife Misty and I baked them muffins and wanted to let everyone know, how awesome they are!All About CarsMary G. ratedAmazing Job, Amazing Prices, Amazing People!The title says it all! I found All About Cars after searching place after place after place, and what a diamond in the rough I found. I have a sebring convertible, and I LOVE that car, so I wouldn't take it anywhere except for the best. Not only do they have great prices but they always do a great job and they always answer all of my questions despite how lame they might be. And if I can't quite afford something that needs to be done they are willing to work with me and figure out a way to make sure my beloved convertible gets taken care of. On top of it all, Joe and the whole crew are just as nice as they can be! Thanks guys for all your good, honest hard work.Silver City Brake & Alignment and MoreCorinaa L. ratedWe have taken my sons Subaru to Silver city break and alignment twice now. I have to say Scott is the best mechanic I have ever met. He takes the time to explain to us what the problem is. When he repairs the vehicle ,It never exceeds what it should be. The  first time we took it there , he repaired the clutch. We haven't had any problems with it. I have never done one of these reviews. I really feel this business deserves five stars. Scott is an honest great mechanic and I would highly recommend this shop. When we take our car there we feel it's in good hands. Scott knows what he's talking about.Did You Know?Finding An Auto Repair ProfessionalThere are more than 700,000 auto service technicians and mechanics in the U.S. Finding the right one to repair a dent in your car door or fix an engine that won't start can be overwhelming, especially when it's an emergency. Review a few important facts about auto repair professionals and what you can do to get the best possible mechanic working on your vehicle's issues for a fair price.Looking For Reliability
Unlike home repair services that evaluate a property, meet with homeowners and have time to prepare before their physical work begins, auto repair businesses are often asked to make fixes on the spot. If you come into a garage with a tire issue, the expectation is the mechanic will know how to correct that problem quickly.That is why reliability is so vital when searching for a trusted auto repair shop. It may take going to several different mechanics before you find one you are truly comfortable with. Pose questions to this professional to find out what approach they will take to repair your car or what alternatives are available. Shopping around also gives you the best opportunity to find the cheapest rate or the fastest service, as some garages may be backed up with other vehicles that need repair first.A recommended way to locate a trustworthy auto repair professional is to seek out customer reviews. Online sites offer honest opinions from real customers who have used a business. Read through this feedback to learn how a business operates and what you can expect if you were to take your vehicle there. Look for reviews about how quick maintenance was completed and if prices were fair. By learning what other people have said about a garage, you can gain a better idea if it's the right place to go when you have a car problem in need of fixing.Understanding When There's An IssueIt can be difficult to know which automotive problems are serious enough to require expert assistance. A ripped seat cushion or broken radio don't involve safety and will not warrant enough of a problem that going into a garage is required. However, setbacks with brakes, lights and other parts that are vital to the safety of your car's driver and passengers, as well as others on the road, necessitate quick fixes. Many modern automobiles will notify drivers of an issue, in the form of a signal on the dashboard or a noise within the vehicle.In the event of an accident, even if your vehicle does not appear to have any damage on the outside, it is generally recommended that you see a trusted auto repair professional. Internal damage may have occurred, or an important part may have been knocked out of place. Fixing these issues before driving much further can prevent further vehicle breakdowns in the future. In the case of a serious accident, a body shop can assess the problems and determine the best course of action for repairs, as well as evaluate how much they will cost.Beyond that, regular checkups are recommended. Tires must be rotated, fluids needs to be replaced and the engine must be evaluated. After driving 25,000 miles, most auto dealers suggest having the vehicle checked out to ensure everything is running smoothly. Taking the car into the auto repair professional you trust will protect you from further problems down the road.Doing Your Own Auto RepairNot every type of auto repair work needs to be done by a certified mechanic. You can fix some of a vehicle's issues just by paying attention to how the automobile is running and having a basic understanding of auto repair. Look over the ways weather may impact your car and what preventative measures you can take to avoid having to take it into the shop. At the same time, be aware of mechanic scams that can impact your experience.Preventing Trips To The Professional
Some fixes to your car can be done without paying a specialist. Issues like replacing oil and air filters are relatively simple, with instructions provided in the owner's manual on how to make these changes. The same goes for replacing broken windshield wipers or burnt-out headlights. Such issues should be repaired quickly to guarantee safety, but don't require a visit to a garage. By handling these types of tasks on your own, you'll gain a better understanding for how your car operates and save time and money.Along with understanding how to fix manageable vehicle issues that may arise, taking preventative measures to avoid future problems is a valuable time saver. Many problem-solving best practices are related to the seasons. Your vehicle will be in different conditions in the winter than in the summer, meaning it requires a different type of preparation.In the spring and summer, you want to be sure your air conditioner and cooling systems work correctly. Given the high temperatures the vehicle will be exposed to, overheating is a common problem. Look over the system by ensuring there is enough coolant available. If it needs to be refilled, it is best to open the hood and add more to the car before it gets too warm out. Also, clean out fan ducts and other ventilation sources necessary for summertime driving.For winter driving, features such as the defroster, heater and exhaust system are paramount. Look in your owner's manual for specific directions on how features should be checked and repaired. Many newer cars have a cabin air filter that can be replaced when needed, allowing warm air to continue to flow in. Also, check your tires before winter driving, as they need to be at the proper pressure to perform well on snow and ice.Avoiding Scams
There is a common worry among many people that auto repair professionals take advantage of the general public. Because so many people are unaware of how to fix the problems in their vehicle, they are nervous of being overcharged by mechanics or worried that the improper work is being done.While the great majority of professionals in the industry are honest, hard-working people, a few bad apples can ruin everything. You should be extra careful when first visiting a mechanic to guarantee that the price you're charged and maintenance the vehicle receives are fair.Among the common scams pulled are needless repairs, where a garage charges you for work that isn't necessary. Another popular one is attracting customers through a cheap oil change or tire pressure check. Then, when you are in the shop and your car is being repaired, they give you a long list of other corrections they'd like to make, therefore boosting the total cost of your bill.The best way to combat these types of problems is getting a written estimate before work is done. That way, you can see how much repairs are expected to cost. If the final bill is higher than the estimate projected, ask to specifically see the work. Make sure information is put in writing as well. If a problem remains, you can have proof that work was not done to your satisfaction.By working closely with an auto repair professional and doing some of the tune-up work on your own, you will be less likely to fall for these scams. At the same time, you'll be able to drive out with a clean and healthy vehicle, thanks to the repairs made by a trained professional.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  General  We begin Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") with the overall strategy of AMERCO, followed by a description of, and strategy related to, our operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our businesses and the direction in which our businesses and products are moving. We then discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. Next, we discuss our results of operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015, and for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2015, which are followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial commitments in the sections entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary and Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments and a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements. We conclude this MD&A by discussing our current outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2016.  This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Quarterly Report, including the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, as discussed under the caption, Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  AMERCO, a Nevada corporation ("AMERCO"), has a third fiscal quarter that ends on the 31st of December for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have a third quarter that ends on the 30th of September for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies' financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the financial position or results of operations. The Company discloses any material events occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries' years 2015 and 2014 correspond to fiscal 2016 and 2015 for AMERCO.  Overall Strategy  Our overall strategy is to maintain our leadership position in the North American "do-it-yourself" moving and storage industry. We accomplish this by providing a seamless and integrated supply chain to the "do-it-yourself" moving and storage market. As part of executing this strategy, we leverage the brand recognition of U-Haul with our full line of moving and self-storage related products and services and the convenience of our broad geographic presence.  Our primary focus is to provide our customers with a wide selection of moving rental equipment, convenient self-storage rental facilities and related moving and self-storage products and services. We are able to expand our distribution and improve customer service by increasing the availability of moving equipment and storage rooms and portable moving and storage units available for rent, expanding the number of independent dealers in our network and expanding and taking advantage of our eMove(R) capabilities.  Property and Casualty Insurance is focused on providing and administering property and casualty insurance to U-Haul and its customers, its independent dealers and affiliates.  Life Insurance is focused on long-term capital growth through direct writing and reinsuring of life, Medicare supplement and annuity products in the senior marketplace.  Description of Operating Segments  AMERCO's three reportable segments are:   Moving and Storage, comprised of AMERCO, U-Haul, and Real Estate and the subsidiaries of U-Haul and Real Estate,  Moving and Storage Operating Segment  Moving and Storage consists of the rental of trucks, trailers, portable moving and storage units, specialty rental items and self-storage spaces primarily to the household mover as well as sales of moving supplies, towing accessories and propane. Operations are conducted under the registered trade name U-Haul(R) throughout the United States and Canada.  With respect to our truck, trailer, specialty rental items and self-storage rental business, we are focused on expanding our dealer network, which provides added convenience for our customers and expanding the selection and availability of rental equipment to satisfy the needs of our customers.  U-Haul brand self-moving related products and services, such as boxes, pads and tape allow our customers to, among other things; protect their belongings from potential damage during the moving process. We are committed to providing a complete line of products selected with the "do-it-yourself" moving and storage customer in mind.  uhaul.com is an online marketplace that connects consumers to Company operations as well as independent Moving Help(R) service providers and thousands of independent Self-Storage Affiliates. Our network of customer-rated providers and affiliates provide pack and load help, cleaning help, self-storage and similar services, all over North America. Our goal is to further utilize our web-based technology platform to increase service to consumers and businesses in the moving and storage market.  Since 1945 U-Haul has incorporated sustainable practices into its everyday operations. We believe that our basic business premise of equipment sharing helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the inventory of total large capacity vehicles. We continue to look for ways to reduce waste within our business and are dedicated to manufacturing reusable components and recyclable products. We believe that our commitment to sustainability, through our products and services and everyday operations, has helped us to reduce our impact on the environment.  Property and Casualty Insurance Operating Segment  Property and Casualty Insurance provides loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul through regional offices across North America. Property and Casualty Insurance also underwrites components of the Safemove, Safetow, Safemove Plus and Safestor protection packages to U-Haul customers. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of these products into the moving and storage market. The business plan for Property and Casualty Insurance includes offering property and casualty products in other U-Haul related programs.  Life Insurance Operating Segment  Life Insurance provides life and health insurance products primarily to the senior market through the direct writing and reinsuring of life insurance, Medicare supplement and annuity policies.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments and assumptions, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain.  In the following pages we have set forth, with a detailed description, the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments. These estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information and valuations available from outside sources and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions; such differences may be material.  We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as revenue recognition; however, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates, because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The accounting policies that we deem most critical to us, and involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments include the following:  Principles of Consolidation  We apply ASC 810 - Consolidation ("ASC 810") in our principles of consolidation. ASC 810 addresses arrangements where a company does not hold a majority of the voting or similar interests of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). A company is required to consolidate a VIE if it has determined it is the primary beneficiary. ASC 810 also addresses the policy when a company owns a majority of the voting or similar rights and exercises effective control.  As promulgated by ASC 810, a VIE is not self-supportive due to having one or both of the following conditions: (i) it has an insufficient amount of equity for it to finance its activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support or (ii) its owners do not hold the typical risks and rights of equity owners. This determination is made upon the creation of a variable interest and is re-assessed on an on-going basis should certain changes in the operations of a VIE, or its relationship with the primary beneficiary trigger a reconsideration under the provisions of ASC 810. After a triggering event occurs the facts and circumstances are utilized in determining whether or not a company is a VIE, which other company(s) have a variable interest in the entity, and whether or not the company's interest is such that it is the primary beneficiary.  We will continue to monitor our relationships with the other entities regarding who is the primary beneficiary, which could change based on facts and circumstances of any reconsideration events.  Recoverability of Property, Plant and Equipment  Our property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Interest expense,if any, incurred during the initial construction of buildings and rental equipment is considered part of cost. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line or an accelerated method based on a declining balance formula over the following estimated useful lives: rental equipment 2-20 years and buildings and non-rental equipment 3-55 years. We follow the deferral method of accounting based on ASC 908 - Airlines for major overhauls in which engine and transmission overhauls are currently capitalized and amortized over three years. Routine maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as they are incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of property, plant and equipment are netted against depreciation expense when realized. Equipment depreciation is recognized in amounts expected to result in the recovery of estimated residual values upon disposal, i.e., minimize gains or losses. In determining the depreciation rate, historical disposal experience, holding periods and trends in the market for vehicles are reviewed.  We regularly perform reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets, including estimates of residual value, may not be recoverable or that the useful life of assets are shorter or longer than originally estimated. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks and trailers. We assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles and the expected life of vehicles included in the fleet. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If asset residual values are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter or longer than originally estimated, the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.  Management determined that additions to the fleet resulting from purchases should be depreciated on an accelerated method based upon a declining formula. Under the declining balances method (2.4 times declining balance), the book value of a rental truck is reduced approximately 16%, 13%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, and 6% during years one through seven, respectively, and then reduced on a straight line basis to a salvage value of 20% by the end of year fifteen. Beginning in October 2012, rental equipment subject to this depreciation schedule will be depreciated to a salvage value of 15%. Comparatively, a standard straight line approach would reduce the book value by approximately 5.7% per year over the life of the truck.  Although we intend to sell our used vehicles for prices approximating book value, the extent to which we realize a gain or loss on the sale of used vehicles is dependent upon various factors including but not limited to, the general state of the used vehicle market, the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal and the depreciation rates with respect to the vehicle. We typically sell our used vehicles at our sales centers throughout North America, on our web site at uhaul.com/trucksales or by phone at 1-866-404-0355. Additionally, we sell a large portion of our pickup and cargo van fleet at automobile dealer auctions.  Insurance Reserves  Liabilities for life insurance and certain annuity and health policies are established to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force, and are based on mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions from recognized actuarial tables which contain margins for adverse deviation. In addition, liabilities for health, disability and other policies include estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for reported losses and estimates of losses incurred, but not yet reported. Liabilities for annuity contracts consist of contract account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders.  Insurance reserves for Property and Casualty Insurance and U-Haul take into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates and are management's best approximation of future payments. These estimates are based upon past claims experience and current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions such as changes in legal theories and inflation. These reserves consist of case reserves for reported losses and a provision for losses incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverables, resulting in a net liability.  Due to the nature of the underlying risks and high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims, the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle these liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability, especially for long-tailed casualty lines of business such as excess workers' compensation. As a result of the long-tailed nature of the excess workers' compensation policies written by Repwest during 1983 through 2001, it may take a number of years for claims to be fully reported and finally settled.  Insurance reserve adequacy is reviewed on a regular basis by management to determine if existing assumptions need to be updated. In determining the assumptions for calculating workers' compensation reserves, management considers multiple factors including the following:   Claimant longevity   Changes in environmental factors including legal and regulatory  We have reserved each claim based upon the accumulation of current claim costs projected through each claimant's life expectancy, and then adjusted for applicable reinsurance arrangements. Management reviews each claim bi-annually to determine if the estimated life-time claim costs have increased and then adjusts the reserve estimate accordingly at that time. We have factored in an estimate of what the potential cost increases could be in our IBNR liability. We have not assumed settlement of the existing claims in calculating the reserve amount, unless it is in the final stages of completion.  Continued increases in claim costs, including medical inflation and new treatments and medications could lead to future adverse development resulting in additional reserve strengthening. Conversely, settlement of existing claims or if injured workers return to work or expire prematurely, could lead to future positive development.  Impairment of Investments  Investments are evaluated pursuant to guidance contained in ASC 320 - Investments - Debt and Equity Securities to determine if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other-than-temporary. Management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment including but not limited to:  Income Taxes  We file a consolidated tax return with all of our legal subsidiaries.  Our tax returns are periodically reviewed by various taxing authorities. The final outcome of these audits may cause changes that could materially impact our financial results.  Fair Values  Fair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of short term investments, investments available-for-sale, long term investments, mortgage loans and notes on real estate, and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value.  Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets. We place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.  We have mortgage receivables, which potentially expose us to credit risk. The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by self-storage facilities and commercial properties. We have not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.  The carrying amount of long term debt and short term borrowings are estimated to approximate fair value as the actual interest rate is consistent with the rate estimated to be currently available for debt of similar term and remaining maturity.  Other investments including short term investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value.  Subsequent Events  Our management has evaluated subsequent events occurring after December 31, 2015, the date of our most recent balance sheet, through the date our financial statements were issued. We do not believe any subsequent events have occurred that would require further disclosure or adjustment to our financial statements.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In March 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The guidance is effective for interim periods and annual period beginning after December 15, 2015; however early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment in this update extends the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 from December 15, 2016.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." The amendments in ASU 2016-01, among other things, requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables); eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, these ASU's entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.  Results of Operations AMERCO and Consolidated Entities Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 compared with the Quarter Ended December 31, 2014 Listed below on a consolidated basis are revenues for our major product lines for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015: Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (Unaudited) (In thousands) Self-moving equipment rentals $ 517,403 $ 487,415 Self-storage revenues 63,164 53,503 Self-moving and self-storage products and service sales 50,038 49,081 Property management fees 8,170 7,497 Life insurance premiums 40,657 39,026 Property and casualty insurance premiums 14,105 13,584 Net investment and interest income 19,026 20,752 Other revenue 32,188 35,497 Consolidated revenue $ 744,751 $ 706,355  Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $30.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue and transactions from both our In-Town and one-way truck and trailer markets increased compared to the same period last year. During the quarter we continued to add new independent dealers and Company-owned locations to our distribution network.  Self-storage revenues increased $9.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by 14.5% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with the same period last year. The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved occupancy at existing locations as well as the addition of new facilities to the portfolio. Over the last twelve months we have added approximately 3.6 million net rentable square feet to the self-storage portfolio with over 1.2 million of that coming on during the third quarter.  Sales of self-moving and self-storage products and services increased $1.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Increases were recognized in the sales of moving supplies and towing accessories and related installations.  Life insurance premiums increased $1.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due primarily to increased life and Medicare supplement premiums.  Property and casualty insurance premiums increased $0.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due to an increase in Safestor and Safetow sales which is a reflection of increased equipment and storage rental transactions.  Net investment and interest income decreased $1.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Reduced note balances due from SAC Holdings and Private Mini resulted in decreased interest income at Moving and Storage combined with a decline at Oxford from lower option income.  Other revenue decreased $3.3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2015 caused primarily by reduced revenue in the U-BoxTM program.  As a result of the items mentioned above, revenues for AMERCO and its consolidated entities were $744.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with $706.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  Listed below are revenues and earnings from operations at each of our operating segments for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015.

ShareCategories ProcuredWhen the Federal government intends to acquire goods or services, it identifies the NAICS code that describes the principal purpose of that procurement. NAICS is production oriented (not product oriented) and categorizes businesses with others that have similar methods of production.Since FY2007, Amerco has been engaged in procurements with the following NAICS codes:

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
