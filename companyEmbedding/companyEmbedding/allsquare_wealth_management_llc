CAREERS – AllSquare Wealth Management















































 






 




CAREERS
 

 
SEEKING EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL ADVISOR
Who you are:
A financial services advisor with 5 or more years of experience and an established client base who prioritizes providing the best possible service for their clients.
You should possess several of the following characteristics:

$40 million or more of assets under management
Awareness of financial planning issues related to managing wealth
 Financial Planner™ certificants or candidates highly preferred
Sophisticated level of knowledge in estate planning, tax planning, retirement planning, and risk management
Attention to detail; strong client meeting skills; ability to complete work in a timely, accurate, and thorough manner
Must be personable and punctual
Clean disciplinary record
Planning on an exit strategy and/or retirement from your business
Interested in bringing a family member into your business

Who we are: 
AllSquare Wealth Management, LLC is an established registered investment adviser (RIA). The firm primarily serves clients in the Capital Region of New York State, but also has clients located in more than 30 states around the country.  Locally-owned, our clients are comprised of the mass affluent, high net worth individuals, trusts, pension plans, and business owners.  We utilize a planning process built on integrity, knowledge, and attention to every last detail, and seek to guide and inform our clients to successfully navigate the various phases of financial and wealth management.  We have a constantly evolving succession plan in place to ensure that we will be here for generations.
Why you want to work with us:
This is a special opportunity unlike most in the financial services industry.  First, AllSquare Wealth is completely independent, so our loyalty belongs exclusively to our clients.  Second, we offer a competitive compensation structure (salary, benefits, bonus, etc).  Third, we provide an opportunity for equity ownership for members who demonstrate hard work and leadership characteristics and support the long-term goals of the firm.  You will be a member of a collaborative and supportive team of strong individuals, all working hard to maintain and grow a profitable multigenerational business.  At AllSquare Wealth, you won’t “own a job” or be building your own practice; this is not an eat-what-you-kill position, and we are not that kind of a firm.
Advisors who meet the above criteria may inquire confidentially about this opportunity by contacting Daniel Bauer at daniel@allsquarewealth.com or 518-456-8900.

Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
