Development of the modern nappy[edit]
In 1947, after having her third child, Valerie Hunter Gordon started developing a product that could prevent the hours of drudgery and wasted resources spent on washing, drying and ironing the traditional towelling nappy. "I just didn't want to wash them," she explained. "It was awful labour."[1] Valerie created her nappies, being a two-part system, consisting of a biodegradable disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable waterproof garment (the PADDI) with press-studs that was not thrown out.




A 1950s advertisement for the PADDI and PADDI-pads system


Initially, she used old military parachutes for the garment where some lettering from the parachutes was visible on early versions.[1][2] She experienced great demand for her invention from friends, particularly other army mothers. Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies though, and Valerie made over 400 PADDIs herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table.[3][4] She sold these for 5 shillings each.[3] Latterly, the then newly created material PVC was used for the garment.
Valerie applied for the patent in April 1948, which was later granted for the PADDI garment in the UK in October 1949, but not for the disposal pad inserts. Valerie unsuccessfully approached several companies for help to make the product on a larger commercial scale.[1] A chance meeting between Valerie's father, Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and Sir Robert Robinson at a Royal Society dinner then led to her signing a contract with Robinson & Sons of Chesterfield on 8 November 1949.[5]
In 1950, Boots agreed to sell PADDI in all their branches.[1] In 1951 the PADDI patent was granted for the US and worldwide. The PADDI was displayed at the Mothercraft Exhibition in Westminster in 1950, and then at the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1952.[5] The BBC featured the invention as one of the six most interesting products at the show, and 750,000 packs had been sold by the end of that year.[4] Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Robinson & Sons. PADDI sales reached 6 million by 1960, and the product was very successful for many years until the advent of Pamper's all-in-one diapers,[4] in which plastic is thrown out together with the wadding, a concept which has been criticised by environmental groups as unsustainable.[6]
The Nikini sanitary towel system[edit]
Following the success of the PADDI, Valerie went on to have three more children and relocate to Beauly when her Scottish husband Patrick Hunter Gordon joined his father Samuel Hunter Gordon in running the family engineering business AI Welders in Inverness. From there, she travelled back and forth to the Robinsons headquarters, where she developed the PADDI design and designed other products. She also created the Nikini sanitary towel system for women, the pad for which may be considered the world's first modern sanitary towel. Rather to her surprise Nikini earned more royalties overall than Paddi, though as she reflected, “there are probably more menstruating women in the world than incontinent babies.”[7]
Personal life[edit]
Valerie Hunter Gordon was the granddaughter of inventor Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, the founder of British electrical engineering firm Ferranti,[8] great-granddaughter of Italian classical guitarist and composer Marco Aurelio Zani de Ferranti and the sister of Basil de Ferranti. Her maternal grandmother, Juliana Scott, was a concert pianist.
Valerie married the decorated Royal Engineer, Major Patrick Hunter Gordon.[9] She died on 19 October 2016 at the age of 94 and was survived by six children, 19 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

Valerie Hunter Gordon

Credit:
PETER JOLLY /NORTHPIX















Valerie Hunter Gordon, who has died aged 94, helped to deliver mothers from the daily drudgery of mangle, washing line and ironing board by inventing the first disposable nappy system.
In 1947 Valerie, the wife of an Army officer, was living in Camberley, Surrey, and expecting her third child. She was not looking forward to the prospect of washing, ironing and drying the traditional towelling nappies which were all that were available at the time. 
“I just didn’t want to wash them,” she told an interviewer last year. “You had to iron them as well. It was awful labour. I was amazed you couldn’t buy a disposable version. I enquired of the US and you couldn’t buy them there. It was extraordinary.” 
So she decided she had better do something about it herself.

After a certain amount of trial and error (initially she used old nylon parachutes, of which there were many spare after the war), and drawing on her considerable needlework skills, she came up with a pair of adjustable PVC waterproof pants fastened with poppers, with a cord around the waist, which could be wiped clean, or washed and bleached. Into these she slipped a pad of cellulose wadding with a thin layer of cotton wool next to the baby’s skin to prevent soreness. The waterproof pants prevented leakage and were shaped to ensure that the pad remained in position without safety pins.
Unlike modern all-in-one disposable nappies, Valerie’s design meant that only the biodegradable dirty pads were disposed of, while the waterproof pants could be rinsed and used again. This  system created very little permanent waste; it also significantly reduced the water and electricity consumption associated with washing cotton nappies.

The nappies were a huge success on her baby son Nigel and she soon began taking orders from the wives of other senior officers at Staff College in Camberley.
“My husband used to cut out the pads on the floor of the attic when he came home from work and I used to run them up with my mother’s old sewing machine... I would go out for tea with the wives and babies, and they would say, 'Oh Valerie, wouldn’t you make one for me?’ It became a full-time job. It was more hard work than washing the damn things.”  
The old Singer sewing machine remained in regular use in her children’s nursery until the final years of her life.
Of the pre-PVC prototypes, Valerie ended up making some 400 pairs of plastic pants in her kitchen from parachute nylon and other experimental materials and selling them for five shillings each. In 1948 she and her husband applied for a patent.
A breakthrough came when Valerie Hunter Gordon’s father, Sir Vincent de Ferranti, met Sir Robert Robinson, a director of Robinsons of Chesterfield, manufacturer of old-fashioned women’s sanitary belts, and told him about his daughter’s invention. 
In 1949, when the family moved to Inverness-shire, Robinsons agreed to start manufacturing the nappies. The pants were patented as a “Paddi”, while the “Paddi Pad” throw-away inserts were made a registered design.

They were not an immediate success. In the frugal postwar years many women found the disposable element of the Paddi wasteful and extravagant, but the idea began to catch on and the product was featured in the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1952. 
The BBC then featured the Paddi as one of the six most innovative items of the year and by the end of that year 750,000 packs had been sold. By 1960 sales had reached six million and the royalties contributed to the Hunter Gordons’  increasing household expenditure (they went on to have three more children).
Valerie Hunter Gordon travelled up and down the country to the Robinsons headquarters in Chesterfield, fine-tuning designs for Paddi and, later on, designing other products including a similar product for women, the Nikini (with “Nikini Pads”), based on the Paddi concept.
Rather to her surprise the Nikini earned more royalties overall than the Paddi, though as she reflected, “there are probably more menstruating women in the world than incontinent babies.”
The Paddi brand went into decline in the 1960s with the arrival of Proctor and Gamble’s all-in-one disposable nappy, Pampers. Robinsons fought back with Paddi Cosifits, but were unable to unable to invest sufficiently in marketing to compete with the American product.
While the Paddi’s PVC pants could be reused, the Pads were disposable, so few examples of the product in their unused, pristine form still exist. The V&A possesses a pack “found in the donor’s mother’s attic”, observing that “due to their ephemeral nature [they] are quite rare.”

Valerie Ziani de Ferranti was born at Baslow, Derbyshire, on December 7 1921, the daughter of Sir Vincent de Ferranti and Dorothy Hettie Wilson. Her grandfather, the inventor Sebastian de Ferranti, was the founder of the eponymous family electrical engineering company.
She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Woldingham, and in 1940 married Patrick Hunter Gordon, then a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, who had won an MC earlier in the year after blowing up a bridge under heavy gunfire during the retreat to Dunkirk.
He suffered post-traumatic illness and Valerie Hunter Gordon unflaggingly supported him over years of investigation and treatment, shielding her children from crises and developing her products all the while. 






She was lunching with Lord Lovat when he joked that her two daughters, in identical tartan dresses, looked like sponge bags






In 1959 she designed the family’s hi-tech house in Inverness-shire. It featured electric self-closing curtains and sophisticated heating systems. She constructed a magnificent garden and would do the weeding in an old raincoat she referred to as her “mink”.
Valerie Hunter Gordon was rarely satisfied with things as they were; she liked to make improvements. She did not believe, for example, that you could only have one Scottish tartan. She was lunching with Lord Lovat one day when he joked that her two daughters, dressed in identical Gordon tartan dresses, looked like sponge bags. 
Determined to find an alternative pattern, she consulted the thread count registers collected by the Highland Society in the 19th century and reconstructed another tartan that was recorded as having been created by Gordon weavers.
A lively pattern with shades of pink, red, green and black, it became one of the most popular Gordon tartans worldwide, marketed as Red Gordon.
Patrick Hunter Gordon died in a car accident in 1978. Valerie Hunter Gordon is survived by their six children.

                    Valerie Hunter Gordon, pictured last year, died at her home in Beauly
                

The mother-of-six who invented the disposable nappy has died at her home near Inverness aged 94.Valerie Hunter Gordon's family said she died on 16 October in Beauly.She created the first "Paddi" after having her third child, Nigel, in 1947 and becoming fed-up with washing traditional nappies.The two-part garments were initially made out of old nylon parachutes, tissue wadding and cotton wool.Mrs Hunter Gordon made hundreds of the nappies using a sewing machine at her kitchen table, supplying friends with the product and constantly modifying the design.



Her husband, Major Pat Hunter Gordon, was also pressed into helping make the nappies when he returned from fighting in Borneo.'Wretched' nappiesSpeaking to the BBC in 2015, Mrs Hunter Gordon said she had found washing nappies much too laborious and so began searching for disposables."I thought you must be able to buy them - but you couldn't, not anywhere," she said."It seemed extraordinary that it hadn't been done before. I thought, it's easy, I'll make them. But it wasn't easy. It was quite tricky."Everybody who saw them said, Valerie, please would you make one for me? And so I ended up by making about over 600 of them."I spent my time sitting at my mother's sewing machine, making these wretched things."Paddis replaced absorbent cotton towelling nappies, which had to be washed after each use."Everybody wanted to stop washing nappies. Nowadays they seem to want to wash them again - good luck to them," Mrs Hunter Gordon said last year.

The couple applied for a patent in 1948 and signed an agreement with Robinsons to manufacture the nappies in 1949. The first nappies were modelled by her son, Nigel.Possible names for the product included Valette, Snappy, Napkins, Lavnets and Drypad. The name Paddi was chosen after a meeting between Major Hunter Gordon and a group of senior executive Army officers at The Army Staff College in Surrey, according to the Paddi website.At first, there was resistance to the nappies from doctors, who thought it would harm babies' skin, and a general public not used to throwing things away in the post-war years.However, an article in Lancet written by an Army doctor who used Paddis for his baby helped change medical opinion and they began to be stocked by Boots.

They were advertised as "A really attractive garment, skilfully designed by a Mother, to make the whole-time use of disposable nappies a practical possibility".The company eventually went into decline in the 1960s, with the arrival of the American brand Pampers.Mrs Hunter Gordon's daughter, Frances Ross, said her mother had been survived by six children, 19 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren, with another due in a few months.

Valerie Hunter Gordon, who has died aged 94, designed the world’s first disposable nappy, initially in 1947 using nylon from old wartime parachutes. Awaiting the birth of her third child, she dreaded what she called the “awful labour” of washing, drying and ironing cloth nappies. Surprised there was no alternative, she determined to invent one. The result was a two-part system, the Paddi: an adjustable waterproof outer garment holding a discardable, biodegradable pad, made of cellulose wadding covered over with cotton wool. She received a patent for the invention in October 1949.
The first 400 she made at her kitchen table with a Singer sewing machine, selling them to friends for five shillings apiece. Boots began to sell her nappies in all their branches in 1950, after a Lancet article argued disposable nappies helped reduce baby rashes. Seventy-two thousand of them sold in 1950, then, in 1951, 250,000. By 1960, the number was 6m. The American company Procter & Gamble began producing the all-in-one Pampers from 1961, which, though not biodegradable, were cheaper. The Paddi entered a slow decline in sales, the last rolling of the assembly line in 1990.
Hunter Gordon’s subsequent inventions included the Nikini, one of the first modern sanitary towels, in 1954, and a house which she continually redesigned to spare household labour. Rather than ironing, she pressed shirts by placing them under the carpet. Tiring of polishing her family’s mahogany table, she made a plastic top, saying “if anybody important comes to stay, we’ll take it off”. It never came off, including during a visit to her house by Margaret Thatcher. Hunter Gordon’s drawing room became a laboratory of invention, with her children Nigel and Frances often roped in to serve as models.

  Boots began to sell Valerie Hunter Gordon’s nappies in all their branches in 1950


Daughter of Sir Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Wilson), she was born in the Peak District, in the small Derbyshire village of Baslow, into a family of inventors. Her grandfather, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, was an Italian-Liverpudlian electrical engineer. Being one of the few experts on alternating-current electricity in Britain, in 1891 he designed the world’s first modern power station, at Deptford, south-east London. Valerie’s father oversaw the expansion of the family business, Ferranti, into a major manufacturer of radios and televisions, involved too in defence electronics and early postwar computing.
Valerie was frequently in and out of her grandfather’s house, living nearby until his death in 1930. He worked often at home, and was fond of sharing with his granddaughter how his inventions worked, and his vision of the use of technology and innovation to improve daily lives. “I suspect that is where she learned if you have a need, and it’s not fulfilled, then maybe you could do something about it yourself,” said her son Nigel. “I know that he loved to tell her about all the things he was doing, and she loved to listen to it.”
She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school, in Roehampton, south-west London, run by a French teaching order of nuns. (After the second world war, the school relocated to the Surrey village of Woldingham, and presently exists as Woldingham school.) In 1940, she married a Scottish major and electrical engineer, Patrick Hunter Gordon. Both her father and husband were involved in the retreat from Dunkirk – her father leading a group home to safety on discarded motorbikes, by way of the Spanish border, arriving home just in time for their wedding.
When Patrick left the army in 1950, the family moved to Beauly, 10 miles west of Inverness. He took over a family business, AI Welders and Cable Belts. He suffered from post-traumatic illness, in which she was a constant support; he, in turn, requisitioned surplus parachute nylon for her experiments, helped her test early designs with families of army colleagues, and encouraged her to bring forward the product commercially.
Her father also was an unflagging supporter. Hunter Gordon wrote to the nappy-makers Robinsons of Chesterfield, who initially were sceptical due to a failed related experiment in the 1930s. At a Royal Society dinner, her father then found himself seated beside the company’s chairman, Sir Robert Robinson – which resulted in her getting a second hearing and an invitation to Chesterfield. She convinced the company to produce them in bulk, paying her royalties, starting in late 1949.
Those familiar with Hunter Gordon describe her as pragmatic and insightful, with a wicked sense of humour and ability to see straight to the nub of a subject. Supremely confident in her own judgment, she was nonetheless personally modest and self-effacing. She said later if she had known the amount of work involved in seeing her invention through, she “would have gone on washing the damned things”.
Patrick died in a car accident in 1978. She is survived by their six children, Hugh, Alison, Nigel – the inspiration and model for the original disposable nappy – Frances, Richard and Kit, 19 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

                    Valerie Hunter Gordon, pictured last year, died at her home in Beauly
                

The mother-of-six who invented the disposable nappy has died at her home near Inverness aged 94.Valerie Hunter Gordon's family said she died on 16 October in Beauly.She created the first "Paddi" after having her third child, Nigel, in 1947 and becoming fed-up with washing traditional nappies.The two-part garments were initially made out of old nylon parachutes, tissue wadding and cotton wool.Mrs Hunter Gordon made hundreds of the nappies using a sewing machine at her kitchen table, supplying friends with the product and constantly modifying the design.



Her husband, Major Pat Hunter Gordon, was also pressed into helping make the nappies when he returned from fighting in Borneo.'Wretched' nappiesSpeaking to the BBC in 2015, Mrs Hunter Gordon said she had found washing nappies much too laborious and so began searching for disposables."I thought you must be able to buy them - but you couldn't, not anywhere," she said."It seemed extraordinary that it hadn't been done before. I thought, it's easy, I'll make them. But it wasn't easy. It was quite tricky."Everybody who saw them said, Valerie, please would you make one for me? And so I ended up by making about over 600 of them."I spent my time sitting at my mother's sewing machine, making these wretched things."Paddis replaced absorbent cotton towelling nappies, which had to be washed after each use."Everybody wanted to stop washing nappies. Nowadays they seem to want to wash them again - good luck to them," Mrs Hunter Gordon said last year.

                    The first nappies were modelled by Mrs Hunter Gordon's son, Nigel
                

The couple applied for a patent in 1948 and signed an agreement with Robinsons to manufacture the nappies in 1949. The first nappies were modelled by her son, Nigel.Possible names for the product included Valette, Snappy, Napkins, Lavnets and Drypad. The name Paddi was chosen after a meeting between Major Hunter Gordon and a group of senior executive Army officers at The Army Staff College in Surrey, according to the Paddi website.At first, there was resistance to the nappies from doctors, who thought it would harm babies' skin, and a general public not used to throwing things away in the post-war years.However, an article in Lancet written by an Army doctor who used Paddis for his baby helped change medical opinion and they began to be stocked by Boots.

They were advertised as "A really attractive garment, skilfully designed by a Mother, to make the whole-time use of disposable nappies a practical possibility".The company eventually went into decline in the 1960s, with the arrival of the American brand Pampers.Mrs Hunter Gordon's daughter, Frances Ross, said her mother had been survived by six children, 19 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren, with another due in a few months.
