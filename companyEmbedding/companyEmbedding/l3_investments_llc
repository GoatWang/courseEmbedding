Goldman Sachs is pulling back from trading America's hottest investment product

REUTERS/Lucas

  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is pulling back
  substantially from trading that helps backstop the fast-growing
  use of U.S. exchange-traded funds, giving smaller firms an
  opportunity to grab market share.

  Goldman has told fund providers it is scaling back its role as a
  top lead market maker (LMM) for ETFs and has already slashed the
  number of funds it supports in that capacity, according to
  disclosures, fund managers and other trading firms this month.

  Relatively high regulatory and other costs of operating as an LMM
  prompted the pullback by Goldman, one of the few large banks
  remaining in that role, some people said.

  A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on the bank's
  market-making business.

  The move signals the shifting landscape of making markets in many
  assets away from traditional broker-dealers towards smaller,
  electronic-focused upstarts.





  LMMs are critical to keeping ETFs trading smoothly. While
  brokers-dealers can typically trade as they please, firms acting
  as LMMs must consistently offer competitive buy-and-sell quotes
  in their assigned ETFs, and they receive rebates on exchange
  fees. Some also provide start-up financing for the funds.

  The LMMs risk some of their own capital to buy and sell ETFs to
  help maintain their liquidity. Unlike smaller rivals, big banks
  like Goldman Sachs are subject to strict capital requirements by
  regulators, putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to costs
  in an already low-margin business.

  ETFs attracted a record $348 billion globally in the first half
  of this year, compared to $123 billion at the same point last
  year, according to research service ETFGI LLP.

  Despite the skyrocketing growth in ETFs, it can be hard to
  translate the LMM business into a high-margin operation.

  Market making is a technology business as much as a trading
  enterprise, and involves finding the right price for funds
  holding dozens of stocks or bonds in a split second while making
  other trades to manage risk.

  One industry veteran described the business as "scraping
  fractions of pennies all day."

  Goldman continues to make issuing its own ETFs through its asset
  management unit a priority, however, even as it steps back from
  providing the infrastructure to keep such funds trading. 

  Bowing out

  Since last year, the number of ETFs backed by Goldman as a LMM on
  Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE Arca trading venue has
  plunged to 178 from 380, according to documents published by
  NYSE.

  Goldman is no longer the lead market maker on major ETFs
  including the $78 billion iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, $14 billion
  Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF and $8 billion WisdomTree
  Japan Hedged Equity Fund, according to NYSE data.

  NYSE Arca is the largest exchange for ETFs by number of listings.
  Other exchanges offer similar programs to encourage market
  making.

  Bill Belden, head of ETF business development for Guggenheim
  Investments, said Goldman is no longer lead market maker on
  several of their ETFs as of last month, "as they have largely
  stepped out of the LMM business."

  Goldman continues to be a force in ETF trading even as it
  withdraws from LMM assignments at exchanges. It held a 9 percent
  market share for U.S. ETF trading at the end of the second
  quarter, up about 20 percent over the same period last year,
  according to exchange traded volume from NYSE Arca and Nasdaq.

  Stepping in

  One of Goldman's competitors, speaking on condition of anonymity,
  said the bank had "a very attractive book of assignments," adding
  that "there is high demand for [exchange-traded products] that
  Goldman is dropping."

  Lesser-known but deeply experienced trading firms, including New
  York-based Jane Street Group LLC and a subsidiary of
  Amsterdam-based IMC BV, have picked up some of Goldman's former
  LMM assignments, NYSE data shows.

  Despite Goldman's exit, some bank-owned trading operations see
  value in the business, such as RBC Capital Markets, part of Royal
  Bank of Canada, which has stepped into new LMM roles.

  Douglas Yones, NYSE's head of ETFs, said that while some of its
  liquidity providers "have narrowed their presence, it has opened
  the door for many more firms to enter the marketplace with
  positive results."

  Goldman reported overall trading revenue of $3.1 billion during
  the second quarter, a drop of 17 percent from the year ago period
  and the worst start to a year since Chief Executive Lloyd
  Blankfein took the helm of the bank.

  The bank's once-massive LMM franchise was partly the inheritance
  of its $6.5 billion acquisition in September 2000 of Spear Leeds
  & Kellogg LP, which served as lead for the first U.S.-listed
  ETF, the SPDR S&P 500, in the early 1990s.

  In 2014, Goldman wrote down the value of the market making
  operations, including its ETF lead market making rights, and
  signaled a broader change in its strategy when it sold some
  related trading operations to IMC.
