Investment Strategy[edit]
Lion Capital seeks to invest in mid and large-sized companies selling branded products, including apparel, accessories and luxury goods, food distribution and specialty retail.[4] Lion Capital’s directors have resisted diversification into other sectors, claiming that their strategy is to know more about less.[1]
Lion Capital’s team draws on its investing and operating expertise to identify consumer brands with growth potential and implement value creating strategies within these businesses, often through geographic expansion, category extension, product innovation or operating improvements.[5] While investments are first and foremost sector driven, Lion Capital focuses on companies in Europe and North America.[4]
History[edit]
Lion Capital was founded in 2004 by Lyndon Lea, Robert Darwent and Neil Richardson with the goal of creating the leading investment firm focused on the consumer sector.[3]
The firm’s predecessor, also run by Lea and Darwent, was launched in 1998 as the European affiliate of American private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst (now HM Capital).[6] Lea and Darwent separated the European affiliate from its ailing American parent, launching Lion Capital as an independent private equity firm.[7]
In 2004, Lion Capital completed fundraising for its first private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund I, with commitments from institutional investors of €820 million.[8] Over thirty institutions committed capital to Fund I.[3]
In April 2007, Lion Capital established a North American presence, opening an office in New York.[3] That same year Lion Capital raised its second private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund II, with approximately €2.0 billion of investor commitments.[9][10]
In 2010, Lion Capital formed its third private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund III, which ultimately included capital commitments of €1.5 billion.[3][11]
In October 2012, the North American office was relocated from New York to Los Angeles.[12]
Investments[edit]
Lion Capital's portfolio has included some of the world's best known consumer brands.[1] Among the firm's most notable investments are:

Bought Weetabix in 2004 for £640 million and sold 60% to Bright Food in 2012 in a deal valuing the company at £1.2 billion[13]
Acquired Jimmy Choo in 2004 for £100 million and sold the company in 2007 for £225 million[14]
Acquired wagamama in 2005 for £102 million[15] and later sold the company for £215 million in 2011[16]
Acquired Orangina Schweppes in 2006 in partnership with the Blackstone Group and later sold the company for €2.6 billion in 2009[17]
Acquired Kettle Foods in 2006 for $270 million and sold the company in 2010 for $615 million[18]
Acquired HEMA in 2007 in a deal estimated to be worth €1.3 billion[19]
Acquired the Findus and Young's brands in 2008 for £1.1 billion[20]
Acquired AS Adventure Group in 2008 for €263 million[21]
Invested $80 million in American Apparel in 2009[22]
Acquired Bumble Bee Foods for $980 million in 2010[23]
Purchased Picard in 2010 for €1.5 billion[24]
Acquired AllSaints in 2011[25]
Acquired Alain Afflelou in 2012 for €740 million[26]
Acquired John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. in 2012[27]
Acquired Good Hair Day (GHD) in 2013 for £300 million[28]
Acquired Pittarosso in 2014 for £295 million[29]

Investment Strategy[edit]
Lion Capital seeks to invest in mid and large-sized companies selling branded products, including apparel, accessories and luxury goods, food distribution and specialty retail.[4] Lion Capital’s directors have resisted diversification into other sectors, claiming that their strategy is to know more about less.[1]
Lion Capital’s team draws on its investing and operating expertise to identify consumer brands with growth potential and implement value creating strategies within these businesses, often through geographic expansion, category extension, product innovation or operating improvements.[5] While investments are first and foremost sector driven, Lion Capital focuses on companies in Europe and North America.[4]
History[edit]
Lion Capital was founded in 2004 by Lyndon Lea, Robert Darwent and Neil Richardson with the goal of creating the leading investment firm focused on the consumer sector.[3]
The firm’s predecessor, also run by Lea and Darwent, was launched in 1998 as the European affiliate of American private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst (now HM Capital).[6] Lea and Darwent separated the European affiliate from its ailing American parent, launching Lion Capital as an independent private equity firm.[7]
In 2004, Lion Capital completed fundraising for its first private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund I, with commitments from institutional investors of €820 million.[8] Over thirty institutions committed capital to Fund I.[3]
In April 2007, Lion Capital established a North American presence, opening an office in New York.[3] That same year Lion Capital raised its second private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund II, with approximately €2.0 billion of investor commitments.[9][10]
In 2010, Lion Capital formed its third private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund III, which ultimately included capital commitments of €1.5 billion.[3][11]
In October 2012, the North American office was relocated from New York to Los Angeles.[12]
Investments[edit]
Lion Capital's portfolio has included some of the world's best known consumer brands.[1] Among the firm's most notable investments are:

Bought Weetabix in 2004 for £640 million and sold 60% to Bright Food in 2012 in a deal valuing the company at £1.2 billion[13]
Acquired Jimmy Choo in 2004 for £100 million and sold the company in 2007 for £225 million[14]

Producer of frozen snacks and ready meals 
At the time of Lion Capital’s acquisition, Ad van Geloven, founded in 1960, was the leading branded producer of frozen snacks and meal components in the Benelux with a full range of products across the category and strong market positions in both the foodservice and retail channels. The company produced various meat ragout products (such as croquettes and bitterballs), minced meat products (frikandels and hamburgers), spring rolls, satay, bami and nasi products. Branded operations were anchored by flagship brand, Mora, the most recognised frozen snack brand in the Benelux region, holding leading positions in all category segments. Headquartered in Tilburg, the company employed more than 900 people across five factories in the Netherlands and Belgium. In 2014, the company generated net sales of €195 million.
During Lion’s ownership, the business faced strong headwinds from challenging consumer environments in its key markets and unprecedented raw material inflation levels. Despite this, Lion Capital continued to invest behind the Mora brand, new product development and a stronger management team. The company’s performance bounced back strongly in the most recent periods of Lion’s ownership and reached the highest level of sales and earnings in its history prior to Lion’s sale of the business in 2015 to TowerBrook Capital Partners.

OUR APPROACH FOR AllSaints
Geographic Expansion
Measured expansion in new and existing markets has accelerated AllSaints financial performance. Under Lion Capital’s ownership, the company has implemented a program to help identify new store locations in select markets across Europe, Asia and North America. During this period, AllSaints has expanded in current markets with 59 new points of sale across North America and Europe, including new flagship stores in Los Angeles, Toronto, Paris and Amsterdam, as well as new locations in South Korea, Taiwan and Dubai. Plans to roll-out the brand into other new geographies are currently underway.

SEE MORE STORIES OF Geographic Expansion >

Operating Improvements
At the time of Lion Capital’s acquisition, AllSaints was operationally and financially challenged following a period of over-expansion. Lion took several material steps to turnaround the business that included wholesale change to the management team, a new distribution centre in the U.S. and rationalisation of the supplier base.

Following an initial two years of growth under our ownership, La Senza suffered a significant decline in trading through the year-end holiday season in 2008, primarily due to the difficult high street retail environment in the U.K. In 2009, Lion Capital put in place initiatives to simplify and stabilise the business, and La Senza’s trading levels rebounded. However, the retailing environment in the U.K. deteriorated again in 2011, and La Senza’s performance declined to a point where it was unable to continue trading as a going concern. On 23 December 2011, La Senza U.K. filed for administration citing "trading conditions" as one of the conditions for closure.

Chain of informal, all-day neighborhood café-bars
Loungers is a fast-growing UK chain of informal, all-day, neighborhood café-bars, founded in Bristol in 2002. The Lounges are places where families, friends, and local residents can come for a coffee, a drink or something to eat in a relaxed and comfortable environment.  The menu is available all day and offers a wide range of dishes alongside an extensive selection of coffee and loose-leaf teas, cakes & pastries, freshly squeezed juices, wines, draught beers and cocktails. In 2010, Loungers launched a second brand, Cosy Club, which offers a slightly more formal occasion with several upscale additions to its food menu and a more extensive drinks offering. Both formats successfully combine elements of casual dining, British pub and coffee shop culture, appealing to a broad range of occasions and demographics. Loungers has grown rapidly over the past five years to nearly 100 sites across the UK. Lion Capital plans to expand its presence through further rollout into new locations.

Leading manufacturer of branded compotes and jams, as well as industrial preserves
Headquartered in France, at the time of Lion Capital’s acquisition Materne specialised in producing fruit compotes, jams and fillings for consumer products and the foodservice and catering industry. The majority of Materne’s products were sold in France, with a small export component to Benelux countries and the U.K. At the time of Lion’s ownership, Materne was the second largest producer of jams in France through the Materne, Confipote and Pom’Potes brands, and the market leader in France in the fruit snack pouches category under the Pom’Potes brand. Materne was also the market leader of the fruit compotes category within both the pouch and cup formats.
Over the course of our ownership, Lion Capital achieved a turnaround in Materne’s operational performance that led to a near doubling of its profitability by the second year of our investment. In December 2006, Lion sold the company to Activa Capital, owner of Mont Blanc, a leading manufacturer of ambient dairy cream desserts in France.

Russian juice producer
Founded in Siberia in 1998, at the time of Lion Capital’s investment Nidan was the fourth largest juice producer in Russia, selling more than 100 varieties of juices, nectars and fruit drinks, with a number one position in Siberia. Nidan’s portfolio of branded juice products was led by flagship brand, Moya Semya, and included the Sokos, Caprice, Caprice Tea, Champion and Da! brands. The company enjoyed an extensive distribution network across Russia and Eastern Europe. Headquartered in Moscow, Nidan operated 20 production lines in two plants with total capacity of more than 870 million litres of production per annum. 
Under Lion Capital’s ownership, sales growth was reinvigorated through increased investment in Nidan’s leading beverage brands along with a reinvigoration of new product development activities. Lion also undertook certain operational improvements to reduce overhead expenses and increase efficiencies within the production facilities of the business. In August 2010, Lion Capital sold Nidan to The Coca-Cola Company.

Website:
oranginaschweppes.com









Fruit-based stills and soft drinks beverage company
Headquartered in Paris, during Lion Capital’s ownership Orangina Schweppes was the number three player in the 31 billion-litre European soft drinks market. The company marketed, bottled and distributed several carbonated soft drinks, stills and other beverages across several European markets under five market-leading premium brands (Schweppes, Orangina, La Casera, Oasis and TriNa). At the time of Lion’s exit in 2009, Orangina Schweppes generated annual sales of over €1.0 billion.
Over the course of our investment, several key strategic changes were brought to bear on the operations of the company, supported by a significant number of new appointments to the senior management team.  Increased support of the key brands and investment in innovation led to a reinvigoration of the company’s core brands. Certain non-core businesses were exited whilst several complementary acquisitions expanded the company’s presence in the Ukraine, Portugal and within the French fruit concentrate category. Under the leadership of a largely new senior management team, Orangina Schweppes achieved above-market financial performance that led to Suntory Holdings acquiring the company from co-owners Lion Capital and The Blackstone Group in late 2009.

OUR APPROACH FOR Orangina Schweppes
Geographic Expansion
Driving international business expansion at Orangina Schweppes was an important component of Lion Capital’s growth strategy for the business. Under Lion’s ownership, the company established partnerships in Sweden and Norway and entered emerging markets in India, Vietnam, Russia and Ukraine. Orangina Schweppes also aligned the brand portfolio with a new strategy to focus on fruit-based drinks, specifically within the fast growing stills category, where acquisitions were also made in Portugal and France.

Operating Improvements
Prior to our acquisition, Orangina Schweppes brands were suffering declines in volumes, price per litre and market share. Lion Capital pursued change in several areas operationally, implementing cost cutting initiatives and cross-border synergies and streamlining the supply chain. These steps combined with our top line growth strategy led to a turnaround in the business. By the end of Lion's ownership period in 2009, Orangina Schweppes was the fastest-growing food and beverage company in France ahead of Danone, Coca-Cola and Heineken.

Private-label wet shaving blades and systems manufacturer
Originally founded in 1875, at the time of Lion Capital’s ownership Personna was the leading global manufacturer of private-label wet shaving razors and blades, and industrial and specialty blades. The company’s products were sold in more than 85 countries, with four manufacturing sites, nine packaging locations, and thirteen sales and distribution centres across the globe. Personna operated under two business divisions: a wet shaving division and an industrial division. The company was headquartered in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey.
After an initial few years of sales and earnings growth under Lion Capital’s ownership, Personna’s financial performance began to decline in 2009 when the company faced aggressive competition from certain private label and branded competitors. Following the loss of its largest U.S. customer and the entry into the private-label business by a large branded player (which marked a structural change to competition within the category), Personna’s financial performance deteriorated further. The company filed for protection under Chapter 11 with U.S. federal bankruptcy court in mid-2010 and later that year all of the company’s assets were acquired by Energizer Holdings, Inc.

Russia's largest producer of vodka and premixed alcoholic beverages

The company’s product range included Zelenaya Marka (Green Mark), the largest vodka brand by volume in Russia and Eastern Europe, and Zhuravli (Cranes), one of the best-performing brands in the premium vodka segment. The company was also a leader in the production of branded ready-to-drink alcoholic cocktails. Headquartered in Moscow, the brand generated sales of over $400 million in 2009.
Lion Capital supported the company through a period of exceptional growth by supplementing the founding management team with experienced international executives, simplifying operations to drive cost efficiencies and service levels, and improving reporting and process disciplines to enable the business to eventually be integrated into a multinational group. During Lion’s ownership, the company’s key brands grew strongly and gained market share. In late 2009, Central European Distribution Corporation, one of the world’s largest spirits businesses, acquired Lion’s stake in Russian Alcohol Group.

Japanese-inspired noodle bar restaurant chain
At the time of Lion Capital’s acquisition of the company, wagamama was the U.K.’s leading chain of branded Japanese-style noodle bars, offering meals based around ramen and udon noodles in broth, various noodle-based dry dishes, curries and accompaniments as well as fresh juices and smoothies. Since its establishment in 1992, the chain had grown to 32 company-owned restaurants in the U.K., with franchised operations in seven other countries in Europe, the Middle East and Australasia at the time of Lion’s initial investment.
Over the course of Lion Capital’s ownership, wagamama’s restaurant estate more than doubled through the opening of nearly 40 restaurants in the United Kingdom, three in the United States (which was the brand’s first entry into the market), and 25 franchised restaurants in 16 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Australasia. The development of a smaller restaurant format during this period supported the brand’s expansion in the U.K. Several operational improvements supported the expansion of profit margins, enabling the company to grow earnings through a challenging recessionary period. In April 2011, Lion Capital sold the company to Duke Street.

Under Lion Capital’s ownership, wagamama stepped up its penetration of current and new markets rolling out nearly 70 new restaurants worldwide.  The successful expansion led to strong and consistent sales growth and transformed the brand from a London-focused chain into an international restaurant brand.

Leading British breakfast cereal company
Founded in 1932, at the time of Lion Capital’s acquisition of the company, Weetabix was a leading manufacturer of cereal and cereal-related products under its own brands and private label in the United Kingdom, exporting to more than 80 countries and operating in North America, South Africa, Germany and Spain. The Weetabix brand was one of the most recognisable names in the grocery sector, with some of the highest levels of awareness by any consumer brand in the market. The company maintained the strongest health credentials of any major cereal manufacturer in the U.K. with a portfolio of well-recognised brands that included Weetabix, Oatibix, Minis, Ready brek, Alpen and Weetos. In 2014, Weetabix generated sales of over £490 million.
Over the course of Lion Capital’s ownership, Weetabix steadily improved its financial performance under a senior management team appointed by Lion. Extensive investment in the company’s brands and a reinvigoration of product innovation led to the launch of several new products, which drove sales growth, whilst improvements in the operations of the company supported profit margins. In late 2012, Lion Capital sold 60% of Weetabix to Bright Food, a multinational food and beverages manufacturing company headquartered in Shanghai, with Lion retaining the remainder of its equity stake in the business. In April 2015, Lion Capital sold its remaining shares in Weetabix to Bright Food.

OUR APPROACH FOR Weetabix
Product Innovation
Lion Capital saw the opportunity to drive growth by Weetabix through new product development especially in the ready-to-eat segment and with on-the-go breakfast solutions, drawing on Weetabix’s reputation for superior product quality and high nutritional profile. Under Lion’s ownership, Weetabix reinvigorated product innovation and brand development activities, launching several new products and range extensions including Weetabix Crispy Minis, Oatibix, Oatiflakes, Alpen Light Bars, Oaty bars and On The Go Breakfast Drink.

INVESTOR CODE OF CONDUCT

Lion Capital LLP (“Lion Capital” or the “Firm”) is a responsible investment fund manager that strives to maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business. The Firm encourages the furtherance of strong ethical and professional principles across all of its business activities, from its interactions with business owners and executives to its engagement of third-party advisors and its introduction to and ongoing partnership with institutions and individuals that commit capital to Lion Capital Sponsored Funds (“Investors”).
  Lion Capital acknowledges its obligations to its Investors and, in addition to applicable laws, rules and regulations that govern investment firms, Lion Capital has implemented this Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) to set forth certain guiding principles governing its interactions with its Investors and other related matters. 
  This Code of Conduct sets forth the expected standard of ethical and legal behaviour applicable to all Lion Capital Executives, emphasises the necessity of adherence to the highest standards of compliance and regulation and imposes requirements relating to transparency and accountability. All Lion Capital Executives are signatories to this Code of Conduct, which supplements the Firm’s Compliance Manual. Breach of this Code of Conduct is a serious matter for any such person and may lead to disciplinary action and, ultimately, termination of their employment with or membership of the Firm, as applicable. 
  Given the variety and complexity of the arrangements relating to Lion Capital, its business, investments, Investors and other stakeholders, this Code of Conduct necessarily only serves as a guide to the principles to be applied in any particular scenario. In case of any doubt, personnel should seek advice from the Firm’s Compliance Officer (Richard Lewis) or Lyndon Lea to ensure their actions comply with both the letter and spirit of this Code of Conduct.
  Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined, have the meanings given in Section 7.
 Section 1: Conflicts of Interest
  Lion Capital holds itself to the highest standard of conduct with respect to its interactions with Investors. In furtherance of this goal, Lion Capital prohibits activities which may contribute to or do not adequately address any conflict of interest between itself and its Investors. 
  Specifically, Lion Capital will not engage in:
  - “revolving door” employment practices with respect to former employees of its Investors, to include employing or compensating in any way any executive, employee or fiduciary of an Investor for two years after termination of such person’s relationship with the Investor;
  - the pursuit of any direct or indirect financial, commercial or business relationship with any Investor official, executive, employee or fiduciary, an employee or fiduciary of an investment adviser or consultant to an Investor, or any Relatives of such persons;
  - the extension of improper gifts to Investor officials, executives, employees or fiduciaries in breach of section 4 of this Code;
  - the misuse of confidential information supplied by Investors, but will use every effort to protect all sensitive or confidential Investor information and will use such information only for performing the services for which Lion Capital has been engaged.
  Lion Capital is mindful of conflicts that may arise between itself and its Sponsored Funds and complies with both the governing agreements of these Funds in this regard and the regulatory rules and principles applicable to the Firm and its personnel.
  All Executives are obliged to disclose to the Compliance Officer any material transaction or relationship that could give rise to a conflict of interest and may not enter into any such transaction unless and until it has been approved by the Firm. 
  Personal dealing and conflicts of interests are also specifically addressed by the Firm’s Compliance Manual.
 Section 2: Use of Third Parties to Secure Investor Commitments
  Lion Capital has used and is likely to continue to retain third parties in an advisory and/or fund-raising capacity to assist it in raising funds (“Placement Agents”).

  - is in the habitual, systematised business of soliciting capital commitments from prospective Investors; and

  - performs reasonable due diligence in respect of potential Investors commensurate with the scope of its engagement;
  - does not make or offer to make any payments or provide other consideration or benefit directly or indirectly with a view to inducing a prospective Investor to enter into contractual negotiations with Sponsored Funds; and

  B. Restrictions on Placement Agents with Respect to Public Pension Funds
  Lion Capital will not directly or indirectly hire, engage, utilise, retain or compensate any person or entity, including but not limited to any Placement Agent, lobbyist, Solicitor, intermediary or consultant, to directly or indirectly communicate for any purpose with any official, executive, employee or fiduciary of a Public Pension Fund in connection with any transaction or investment between Lion Capital and the Public Pension Fund where to do so would violate, or would cause Lion Capital or any of its Executives to violate, any laws, rules, regulations, policy statements or codes of conduct applicable to any such Public Pension Fund. Where appropriate this restriction shall include but shall not be limited to:
  - introducing, finding, referring, facilitating, arranging, expediting, fostering or establishing a relationship with, or obtaining access to a Public Pension Fund.

  - any person or entity whose sole basis of compensation from Lion Capital is the actual provision of legal, accounting or other professional advice, services or assistance that is unrelated to any solicitation, introduction, finding, or referral of clients to Lion Capital or the brokering, fostering, establishing or maintaining of a relationship between Lion Capital and a Public Pension Fund; or
  - lobbying of a government or legislature on issues unrelated to investment or other financial decisions by Public Pension Funds or their Advisors.
 Section 3: Restrictions on Campaign Contributions and Solicitations 
  Lion Capital’s policies on campaign contributions and solicitations are designed to (i) protect the integrity of Lion Capital’s fundraising activities pertaining to its Sponsored Funds by avoiding conflicts or the appearance thereof with politically connected Investors, (ii) prevent any Lion Capital Executive from attributing their personal political activities to Lion Capital and (iii) ensure that Lion Capital complies with applicable restrictions and limits on political contributions and gifts made by employees to any officeholders, candidates for office, and political action committees throughout the world. 
  In connection with the foregoing principles, Lion Capital does not make (nor encourage any Lion Capital Executive to make) Contributions to Officials and Public Pension Fund Officials. Any Lion Capital Executive wishing to make such a contribution privately must have this pre-cleared with the Compliance Officer.
  Lion Capital Executives engaged in personal political activity (e.g., election campaign work, solicitation of contributions), that are not prohibited by this Code of Conduct, must not attribute such activity to Lion Capital.

  In addition to the foregoing, Lion Capital may provide Business Entertainment to certain Investors (such as individual Investors) who are not subject to the same conflicts of interest considerations as other Investors. Any such entertainment above a de minimis value must be approved by the Compliance Officer. While any Business Entertainment provided to such Investors must be in accordance with the spirit of this Code, it is recognised that such Investors are not subject to the same constraints as individuals who themselves are subject to fiduciary obligations. Nonetheless, no Gift which is (or may be construed as) not customary business practice, or the purpose of which is to gain an unfair business advantage, shall be given or received by the Firm or any Executive. 
 Section 5: Disclosures to Investors or Prospective Investors 
  Upon request by any Lion Capital Investor, Lion will disclose all relevant information related to its engagement of Placement Agents and the qualifications of its Executives engaged in the solicitation of Investor commitments. Lion Capital will also provide a prospective Investor with the same information during such prospective Investor’s due diligence process, subject to such prospective Investor agreeing to customary confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. 
 Section 6: Education and Training 
  All Lion Capital Executives must sign this Code of Conduct as an affirmation of their commitment to the standards and principles detailed within. Lion Capital will train all new relevant Executives on the requirements set out in the Code within a reasonable time of their joining of the Firm.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 54, PART 6 OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015 (the “Act”)
  This statement relates to the financial year ended 31 December 2016 and sets out the steps that Lion Capital LLP (“Lion Capital”, the “Firm” or “we”) has taken and intends to take to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its business or supply chains.
Our structure, business and supply chains
  The Firm is a global consumer-focused investor, with offices in London and Los Angeles. The Firm provides investment management services to various investment funds established in the United Kingdom (the “Funds”), which focus on making investments in Europe and North America. 
  As a private equity investor, our immediate supply chain is relatively short, consisting mainly of professional services firms. 
  The Funds that we manage invest in a number of portfolio companies. Though these portfolio companies do not form part of the Firm’s supply chain, we are committed to taking steps to confirm that each portfolio company’s management team understands any responsibilities it has under the Act and the need for it to put in place its own effective controls and training to protect against modern slavery being present in its own business and supply chains.
  To this end, we have written to the management of those portfolio companies that we consider may be subject to the Act, to ensure that they understand their obligations under the Act. In addition, we have representation on each portfolio company board and, although not a standing agenda item, ensuring compliance with the Act and limiting the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking taking place in their business and supply chains remains a key consideration of the companies’ boards. 
Policy Statement
  In pursuit of best-in-class approach, Lion Capital is a signatory of the six UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment. The Firm is a responsible investment fund manager that strives to maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business. Lion Capital expects all of its portfolio companies and employees to comply with ESG-related legislation at a local, national and international level, including but not limited to applicable environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption and human rights legislation. 
  Lion Capital portfolio companies are actively involved in a collaboration project (“Not for Sale”) which raises awareness about human trafficking and, as an active board member of “Not for Sale”, in 2016 Lion Capital has promoted the prevention of human trafficking at various investor meetings and conferences.
Our approach to due diligence
  As part of the Firm’s standard investment due diligence process, Lion employs external advisers to conduct site visits, management interviews and public searches to diagnose any potential environmental/social liabilities, and ensure portfolio company compliance with Lion’s philosophy in these areas. At the point that a Fund acquires a portfolio
 company, we ensure that such portfolio company’s management team is aware of their potential obligations under the Act.
  We do not consider that the relationships within our immediate supply chain give rise to material risks in this area. However, we will be requiring key suppliers to confirm that their activities accord with the requirements of the Act. 
  We also have a dedicated Compliance Officer, who oversees the above process.
Training
  The Firm has provided details of this policy to all relevant staff. We ensure that all employees, on joining the Firm and periodically thereafter, review and familiarise themselves with the Firm’s policies to ensure that they can identify situations where there is a risk of modern slavery or human trafficking.
Further steps
  Additional steps that we intend to take in order to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or supply chains are:

to develop and enhance existing policies (if any) or create new policies relating to slavery and human trafficking, in order to provide a framework for identifying and monitoring activities within our business and supply chains that may be in breach of such policies; 
to review our due diligence processes to ensure that they comply with our policies on slavery and human trafficking; and
to review current training provided in respect of our policies and their implementation and ensure the applicable level of training is delivered to employees so that they are more effective in identifying the existence or risk of slavery and human trafficking as part of the investment due diligence process.

  This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Lion Capital LLP’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 December 2016. It has been endorsed by the Operating Committee on behalf of the Firm.

The Firm encourages the furtherance of strong ethical and professional principles across all of its business activities, from its interactions with business owners and executives to its engagement of third-party advisors and its introduction to and ongoing partnership with institutions and individuals that commit capital to Lion Capital Sponsored Funds (“Investors”).
  Lion Capital acknowledges its obligations to its Investors and, in addition to applicable laws, rules and regulations that govern investment firms, Lion Capital has implemented this Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) to set forth certain guiding principles governing its interactions with its Investors and other related matters. 
  This Code of Conduct sets forth the expected standard of ethical and legal behaviour applicable to all Lion Capital Executives, emphasises the necessity of adherence to the highest standards of compliance and regulation and imposes requirements relating to transparency and accountability. All Lion Capital Executives are signatories to this Code of Conduct, which supplements the Firm’s Compliance Manual. Breach of this Code of Conduct is a serious matter for any such person and may lead to disciplinary action and, ultimately, termination of their employment with or membership of the Firm, as applicable. 
  Given the variety and complexity of the arrangements relating to Lion Capital, its business, investments, Investors and other stakeholders, this Code of Conduct necessarily only serves as a guide to the principles to be applied in any particular scenario. In case of any doubt, personnel should seek advice from the Firm’s Compliance Officer (Richard Lewis) or Lyndon Lea to ensure their actions comply with both the letter and spirit of this Code of Conduct.
  Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined, have the meanings given in Section 7.
 Section 1: Conflicts of Interest
  Lion Capital holds itself to the highest standard of conduct with respect to its interactions with Investors. In furtherance of this goal, Lion Capital prohibits activities which may contribute to or do not adequately address any conflict of interest between itself and its Investors. 
  Specifically, Lion Capital will not engage in:
  - “revolving door” employment practices with respect to former employees of its Investors, to include employing or compensating in any way any executive, employee or fiduciary of an Investor for two years after termination of such person’s relationship with the Investor;
  - the pursuit of any direct or indirect financial, commercial or business relationship with any Investor official, executive, employee or fiduciary, an employee or fiduciary of an investment adviser or consultant to an Investor, or any Relatives of such persons;
  - the extension of improper gifts to Investor officials, executives, employees or fiduciaries in breach of section 4 of this Code;
  - the misuse of confidential information supplied by Investors, but will use every effort to protect all sensitive or confidential Investor information and will use such information only for performing the services for which Lion Capital has been engaged.
  Lion Capital is mindful of conflicts that may arise between itself and its Sponsored Funds and complies with both the governing agreements of these Funds in this regard and the regulatory rules and principles applicable to the Firm and its personnel.
  All Executives are obliged to disclose to the Compliance Officer any material transaction or relationship that could give rise to a conflict of interest and may not enter into any such transaction unless and until it has been approved by the Firm. 
  Personal dealing and conflicts of interests are also specifically addressed by the Firm’s Compliance Manual.
 Section 2: Use of Third Parties to Secure Investor Commitments
  Lion Capital has used and is likely to continue to retain third parties in an advisory and/or fund-raising capacity to assist it in raising funds (“Placement Agents”). When engaging a Placement Agent, Lion Capital will enter into a written contract that specifies the scope of services to be performed and the fee arrangement. In addition, Lion Capital will only engage Placement Agents who adhere to (i) the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Placement Agents Supplementary Code of Conduct, dated June 2009, as the same may be amended from time to time (the “EVCA Code”) and (ii) this Code of Conduct insofar as it pertains to Placement Agents. 
  A. General Placement Agent Standards 
  Lion Capital will only retain a Placement Agent that:
  - is registered and/or authorised with, and regulated by, as applicable, appropriate regulatory bodies in each jurisdiction in which it undertakes regulated activities; 
  - possesses the licenses or certifications required by legal, governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory organisations to which the Placement Agent or its representatives are subject;
  - is in the habitual, systematised business of soliciting capital commitments from prospective Investors; and
  - operates in an environment with established compliance and oversight processes.
  Furthermore, Lion Capital will only engage a Placement Agent that:
  - maintains high standards of probity, integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business;
  - performs reasonable due diligence in respect of potential Investors commensurate with the scope of its engagement;
  - does not make or offer to make any payments or provide other consideration or benefit directly or indirectly with a view to inducing a prospective Investor to enter into contractual negotiations with Sponsored Funds; and
  - employs appropriately qualified staff, authorised and supervised commensurate with the capacity in which they are employed and the jurisdictions in which they operate.
  B. Restrictions on Placement Agents with Respect to Public Pension Funds
  Lion Capital will not directly or indirectly hire, engage, utilise, retain or compensate any person or entity, including but not limited to any Placement Agent, lobbyist, Solicitor, intermediary or consultant, to directly or indirectly communicate for any purpose with any official, executive, employee or fiduciary of a Public Pension Fund in connection with any transaction or investment between Lion Capital and the Public Pension Fund where to do so would violate, or would cause Lion Capital or any of its Executives to violate, any laws, rules, regulations, policy statements or codes of conduct applicable to any such Public Pension Fund. Where appropriate this restriction shall include but shall not be limited to:
  - introducing, finding, referring, facilitating, arranging, expediting, fostering or establishing a relationship with, or obtaining access to a Public Pension Fund.
  - soliciting an investment from a Public Pension Fund; or
  - influencing or attempting to influence the outcome of any investment or other financial decision by a Public Pension Fund.
  For further clarity, the foregoing restrictions do not apply to:
  - any Executive of Lion Capital who is acting within the scope of his or her normal professional duties on behalf of Lion Capital;
  - any person or entity whose sole basis of compensation from Lion Capital is the actual provision of legal, accounting or other professional advice, services or assistance that is unrelated to any solicitation, introduction, finding, or referral of clients to Lion Capital or the brokering, fostering, establishing or maintaining of a relationship between Lion Capital and a Public Pension Fund; or
  - lobbying of a government or legislature on issues unrelated to investment or other financial decisions by Public Pension Funds or their Advisors.
 Section 3: Restrictions on Campaign Contributions and Solicitations 
  Lion Capital’s policies on campaign contributions and solicitations are designed to (i) protect the integrity of Lion Capital’s fundraising activities pertaining to its Sponsored Funds by avoiding conflicts or the appearance thereof with politically connected Investors, (ii) prevent any Lion Capital Executive from attributing their personal political activities to Lion Capital and (iii) ensure that Lion Capital complies with applicable restrictions and limits on political contributions and gifts made by employees to any officeholders, candidates for office, and political action committees throughout the world. 
  In connection with the foregoing principles, Lion Capital does not make (nor encourage any Lion Capital Executive to make) Contributions to Officials and Public Pension Fund Officials. Any Lion Capital Executive wishing to make such a contribution privately must have this pre-cleared with the Compliance Officer.
  Lion Capital Executives engaged in personal political activity (e.g., election campaign work, solicitation of contributions), that are not prohibited by this Code of Conduct, must not attribute such activity to Lion Capital. Lion Capital’s name, facilities, property and resources (including e-mails) may not be used in connection with political activities.
  Contributions to any political organisation must be disclosed to, and approved by, the Compliance Officer. 
  New Executives of Lion Capital will be required to disclose to the Compliance Officer all Contributions to any political organisation made by such Executive within two years prior to joining Lion Capital or such longer period of time as may be determined by the Compliance Officer.
 Section 4: Gifts and Business Entertainment 
  It is the general policy of Lion Capital to not provide any of its Investors or prospective Investors with Gifts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that Lion Capital may hold periodic meetings of (i) some or all of its Investors or (ii) members of its Funds’ Investor Advisory Boards (or equivalent bodies) and attendees at such meetings may receive meals, accommodation, refreshments, participation in customary business-related activities (e.g., a round of golf) and Portfolio Company or Lion Capital branded items (such items limited to a value of $100 in each case). 
  In addition to the foregoing, Lion Capital may provide Business Entertainment to certain Investors (such as individual Investors) who are not subject to the same conflicts of interest considerations as other Investors. Any such entertainment above a de minimis value must be approved by the Compliance Officer. While any Business Entertainment provided to such Investors must be in accordance with the spirit of this Code, it is recognised that such Investors are not subject to the same constraints as individuals who themselves are subject to fiduciary obligations. Nonetheless, no Gift which is (or may be construed as) not customary business practice, or the purpose of which is to gain an unfair business advantage, shall be given or received by the Firm or any Executive. 
 Section 5: Disclosures to Investors or Prospective Investors 
  Upon request by any Lion Capital Investor, Lion will disclose all relevant information related to its engagement of Placement Agents and the qualifications of its Executives engaged in the solicitation of Investor commitments. Lion Capital will also provide a prospective Investor with the same information during such prospective Investor’s due diligence process, subject to such prospective Investor agreeing to customary confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. 
 Section 6: Education and Training 
  All Lion Capital Executives must sign this Code of Conduct as an affirmation of their commitment to the standards and principles detailed within. Lion Capital will train all new relevant Executives on the requirements set out in the Code within a reasonable time of their joining of the Firm. On an annual basis, the Compliance Officer shall review the requirements set out within this Code with all of the Firm’s Executives and require a certification from each Executive attesting to their completion of the review.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 54, PART 6 OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015 (the “Act”)
  This statement relates to the financial year ended 31 December 2016 and sets out the steps that Lion Capital LLP (“Lion Capital”, the “Firm” or “we”) has taken and intends to take to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its business or supply chains.
Our structure, business and supply chains
  The Firm is a global consumer-focused investor, with offices in London and Los Angeles. The Firm provides investment management services to various investment funds established in the United Kingdom (the “Funds”), which focus on making investments in Europe and North America. 
  As a private equity investor, our immediate supply chain is relatively short, consisting mainly of professional services firms. 
  The Funds that we manage invest in a number of portfolio companies. Though these portfolio companies do not form part of the Firm’s supply chain, we are committed to taking steps to confirm that each portfolio company’s management team understands any responsibilities it has under the Act and the need for it to put in place its own effective controls and training to protect against modern slavery being present in its own business and supply chains.
  To this end, we have written to the management of those portfolio companies that we consider may be subject to the Act, to ensure that they understand their obligations under the Act. In addition, we have representation on each portfolio company board and, although not a standing agenda item, ensuring compliance with the Act and limiting the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking taking place in their business and supply chains remains a key consideration of the companies’ boards. 
Policy Statement
  In pursuit of best-in-class approach, Lion Capital is a signatory of the six UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment. The Firm is a responsible investment fund manager that strives to maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business. Lion Capital expects all of its portfolio companies and employees to comply with ESG-related legislation at a local, national and international level, including but not limited to applicable environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption and human rights legislation. 
  Lion Capital portfolio companies are actively involved in a collaboration project (“Not for Sale”) which raises awareness about human trafficking and, as an active board member of “Not for Sale”, in 2016 Lion Capital has promoted the prevention of human trafficking at various investor meetings and conferences.
Our approach to due diligence
  As part of the Firm’s standard investment due diligence process, Lion employs external advisers to conduct site visits, management interviews and public searches to diagnose any potential environmental/social liabilities, and ensure portfolio company compliance with Lion’s philosophy in these areas. At the point that a Fund acquires a portfolio
 company, we ensure that such portfolio company’s management team is aware of their potential obligations under the Act.
  We do not consider that the relationships within our immediate supply chain give rise to material risks in this area. However, we will be requiring key suppliers to confirm that their activities accord with the requirements of the Act. 
  We also have a dedicated Compliance Officer, who oversees the above process.
Training
  The Firm has provided details of this policy to all relevant staff. We ensure that all employees, on joining the Firm and periodically thereafter, review and familiarise themselves with the Firm’s policies to ensure that they can identify situations where there is a risk of modern slavery or human trafficking.
Further steps
  Additional steps that we intend to take in order to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or supply chains are:

to develop and enhance existing policies (if any) or create new policies relating to slavery and human trafficking, in order to provide a framework for identifying and monitoring activities within our business and supply chains that may be in breach of such policies; 
to review our due diligence processes to ensure that they comply with our policies on slavery and human trafficking; and
to review current training provided in respect of our policies and their implementation and ensure the applicable level of training is delivered to employees so that they are more effective in identifying the existence or risk of slavery and human trafficking as part of the investment due diligence process.

  This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Lion Capital LLP’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 December 2016. It has been endorsed by the Operating Committee on behalf of the Firm.

INVESTOR CODE OF CONDUCT

Lion Capital LLP (“Lion Capital” or the “Firm”) is a responsible investment fund manager that strives to maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business. The Firm encourages the furtherance of strong ethical and professional principles across all of its business activities, from its interactions with business owners and executives to its engagement of third-party advisors and its introduction to and ongoing partnership with institutions and individuals that commit capital to Lion Capital Sponsored Funds (“Investors”).
  Lion Capital acknowledges its obligations to its Investors and, in addition to applicable laws, rules and regulations that govern investment firms, Lion Capital has implemented this Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) to set forth certain guiding principles governing its interactions with its Investors and other related matters. 
  This Code of Conduct sets forth the expected standard of ethical and legal behaviour applicable to all Lion Capital Executives, emphasises the necessity of adherence to the highest standards of compliance and regulation and imposes requirements relating to transparency and accountability. All Lion Capital Executives are signatories to this Code of Conduct, which supplements the Firm’s Compliance Manual. Breach of this Code of Conduct is a serious matter for any such person and may lead to disciplinary action and, ultimately, termination of their employment with or membership of the Firm, as applicable. 
  Given the variety and complexity of the arrangements relating to Lion Capital, its business, investments, Investors and other stakeholders, this Code of Conduct necessarily only serves as a guide to the principles to be applied in any particular scenario. In case of any doubt, personnel should seek advice from the Firm’s Compliance Officer (Richard Lewis) or Lyndon Lea to ensure their actions comply with both the letter and spirit of this Code of Conduct.
  Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined, have the meanings given in Section 7.
 Section 1: Conflicts of Interest
  Lion Capital holds itself to the highest standard of conduct with respect to its interactions with Investors. In furtherance of this goal, Lion Capital prohibits activities which may contribute to or do not adequately address any conflict of interest between itself and its Investors. 
  Specifically, Lion Capital will not engage in:
  - “revolving door” employment practices with respect to former employees of its Investors, to include employing or compensating in any way any executive, employee or fiduciary of an Investor for two years after termination of such person’s relationship with the Investor;
  - the pursuit of any direct or indirect financial, commercial or business relationship with any Investor official, executive, employee or fiduciary, an employee or fiduciary of an investment adviser or consultant to an Investor, or any Relatives of such persons;
  - the extension of improper gifts to Investor officials, executives, employees or fiduciaries in breach of section 4 of this Code;
  - the misuse of confidential information supplied by Investors, but will use every effort to protect all sensitive or confidential Investor information and will use such information only for performing the services for which Lion Capital has been engaged.
  Lion Capital is mindful of conflicts that may arise between itself and its Sponsored Funds and complies with both the governing agreements of these Funds in this regard and the regulatory rules and principles applicable to the Firm and its personnel.
  All Executives are obliged to disclose to the Compliance Officer any material transaction or relationship that could give rise to a conflict of interest and may not enter into any such transaction unless and until it has been approved by the Firm. 
  Personal dealing and conflicts of interests are also specifically addressed by the Firm’s Compliance Manual.
 Section 2: Use of Third Parties to Secure Investor Commitments
  Lion Capital has used and is likely to continue to retain third parties in an advisory and/or fund-raising capacity to assist it in raising funds (“Placement Agents”). When engaging a Placement Agent, Lion Capital will enter into a written contract that specifies the scope of services to be performed and the fee arrangement. In addition, Lion Capital will only engage Placement Agents who adhere to (i) the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Placement Agents Supplementary Code of Conduct, dated June 2009, as the same may be amended from time to time (the “EVCA Code”) and (ii) this Code of Conduct insofar as it pertains to Placement Agents. 
  A. General Placement Agent Standards 
  Lion Capital will only retain a Placement Agent that:
  - is registered and/or authorised with, and regulated by, as applicable, appropriate regulatory bodies in each jurisdiction in which it undertakes regulated activities; 
  - possesses the licenses or certifications required by legal, governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory organisations to which the Placement Agent or its representatives are subject;
  - is in the habitual, systematised business of soliciting capital commitments from prospective Investors; and
  - operates in an environment with established compliance and oversight processes.
  Furthermore, Lion Capital will only engage a Placement Agent that:
  - maintains high standards of probity, integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business;
  - performs reasonable due diligence in respect of potential Investors commensurate with the scope of its engagement;
  - does not make or offer to make any payments or provide other consideration or benefit directly or indirectly with a view to inducing a prospective Investor to enter into contractual negotiations with Sponsored Funds; and
  - employs appropriately qualified staff, authorised and supervised commensurate with the capacity in which they are employed and the jurisdictions in which they operate.
  B. Restrictions on Placement Agents with Respect to Public Pension Funds
  Lion Capital will not directly or indirectly hire, engage, utilise, retain or compensate any person or entity, including but not limited to any Placement Agent, lobbyist, Solicitor, intermediary or consultant, to directly or indirectly communicate for any purpose with any official, executive, employee or fiduciary of a Public Pension Fund in connection with any transaction or investment between Lion Capital and the Public Pension Fund where to do so would violate, or would cause Lion Capital or any of its Executives to violate, any laws, rules, regulations, policy statements or codes of conduct applicable to any such Public Pension Fund. Where appropriate this restriction shall include but shall not be limited to:
  - introducing, finding, referring, facilitating, arranging, expediting, fostering or establishing a relationship with, or obtaining access to a Public Pension Fund.
  - soliciting an investment from a Public Pension Fund; or
  - influencing or attempting to influence the outcome of any investment or other financial decision by a Public Pension Fund.
  For further clarity, the foregoing restrictions do not apply to:
  - any Executive of Lion Capital who is acting within the scope of his or her normal professional duties on behalf of Lion Capital;
  - any person or entity whose sole basis of compensation from Lion Capital is the actual provision of legal, accounting or other professional advice, services or assistance that is unrelated to any solicitation, introduction, finding, or referral of clients to Lion Capital or the brokering, fostering, establishing or maintaining of a relationship between Lion Capital and a Public Pension Fund; or
  - lobbying of a government or legislature on issues unrelated to investment or other financial decisions by Public Pension Funds or their Advisors.
 Section 3: Restrictions on Campaign Contributions and Solicitations 
  Lion Capital’s policies on campaign contributions and solicitations are designed to (i) protect the integrity of Lion Capital’s fundraising activities pertaining to its Sponsored Funds by avoiding conflicts or the appearance thereof with politically connected Investors, (ii) prevent any Lion Capital Executive from attributing their personal political activities to Lion Capital and (iii) ensure that Lion Capital complies with applicable restrictions and limits on political contributions and gifts made by employees to any officeholders, candidates for office, and political action committees throughout the world. 
  In connection with the foregoing principles, Lion Capital does not make (nor encourage any Lion Capital Executive to make) Contributions to Officials and Public Pension Fund Officials. Any Lion Capital Executive wishing to make such a contribution privately must have this pre-cleared with the Compliance Officer.
  Lion Capital Executives engaged in personal political activity (e.g., election campaign work, solicitation of contributions), that are not prohibited by this Code of Conduct, must not attribute such activity to Lion Capital. Lion Capital’s name, facilities, property and resources (including e-mails) may not be used in connection with political activities.
  Contributions to any political organisation must be disclosed to, and approved by, the Compliance Officer. 
  New Executives of Lion Capital will be required to disclose to the Compliance Officer all Contributions to any political organisation made by such Executive within two years prior to joining Lion Capital or such longer period of time as may be determined by the Compliance Officer.
 Section 4: Gifts and Business Entertainment 
  It is the general policy of Lion Capital to not provide any of its Investors or prospective Investors with Gifts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that Lion Capital may hold periodic meetings of (i) some or all of its Investors or (ii) members of its Funds’ Investor Advisory Boards (or equivalent bodies) and attendees at such meetings may receive meals, accommodation, refreshments, participation in customary business-related activities (e.g., a round of golf) and Portfolio Company or Lion Capital branded items (such items limited to a value of $100 in each case). 
  In addition to the foregoing, Lion Capital may provide Business Entertainment to certain Investors (such as individual Investors) who are not subject to the same conflicts of interest considerations as other Investors. Any such entertainment above a de minimis value must be approved by the Compliance Officer. While any Business Entertainment provided to such Investors must be in accordance with the spirit of this Code, it is recognised that such Investors are not subject to the same constraints as individuals who themselves are subject to fiduciary obligations. Nonetheless, no Gift which is (or may be construed as) not customary business practice, or the purpose of which is to gain an unfair business advantage, shall be given or received by the Firm or any Executive. 
 Section 5: Disclosures to Investors or Prospective Investors 
  Upon request by any Lion Capital Investor, Lion will disclose all relevant information related to its engagement of Placement Agents and the qualifications of its Executives engaged in the solicitation of Investor commitments. Lion Capital will also provide a prospective Investor with the same information during such prospective Investor’s due diligence process, subject to such prospective Investor agreeing to customary confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. 
 Section 6: Education and Training 
  All Lion Capital Executives must sign this Code of Conduct as an affirmation of their commitment to the standards and principles detailed within. Lion Capital will train all new relevant Executives on the requirements set out in the Code within a reasonable time of their joining of the Firm. On an annual basis, the Compliance Officer shall review the requirements set out within this Code with all of the Firm’s Executives and require a certification from each Executive attesting to their completion of the review.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 54, PART 6 OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015 (the “Act”)
  This statement relates to the financial year ended 31 December 2016 and sets out the steps that Lion Capital LLP (“Lion Capital”, the “Firm” or “we”) has taken and intends to take to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its business or supply chains.
Our structure, business and supply chains
  The Firm is a global consumer-focused investor, with offices in London and Los Angeles. The Firm provides investment management services to various investment funds established in the United Kingdom (the “Funds”), which focus on making investments in Europe and North America. 
  As a private equity investor, our immediate supply chain is relatively short, consisting mainly of professional services firms. 
  The Funds that we manage invest in a number of portfolio companies. Though these portfolio companies do not form part of the Firm’s supply chain, we are committed to taking steps to confirm that each portfolio company’s management team understands any responsibilities it has under the Act and the need for it to put in place its own effective controls and training to protect against modern slavery being present in its own business and supply chains.
  To this end, we have written to the management of those portfolio companies that we consider may be subject to the Act, to ensure that they understand their obligations under the Act. In addition, we have representation on each portfolio company board and, although not a standing agenda item, ensuring compliance with the Act and limiting the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking taking place in their business and supply chains remains a key consideration of the companies’ boards. 
Policy Statement
  In pursuit of best-in-class approach, Lion Capital is a signatory of the six UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment. The Firm is a responsible investment fund manager that strives to maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in the conduct of its business. Lion Capital expects all of its portfolio companies and employees to comply with ESG-related legislation at a local, national and international level, including but not limited to applicable environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption and human rights legislation. 
  Lion Capital portfolio companies are actively involved in a collaboration project (“Not for Sale”) which raises awareness about human trafficking and, as an active board member of “Not for Sale”, in 2016 Lion Capital has promoted the prevention of human trafficking at various investor meetings and conferences.
Our approach to due diligence
  As part of the Firm’s standard investment due diligence process, Lion employs external advisers to conduct site visits, management interviews and public searches to diagnose any potential environmental/social liabilities, and ensure portfolio company compliance with Lion’s philosophy in these areas. At the point that a Fund acquires a portfolio
 company, we ensure that such portfolio company’s management team is aware of their potential obligations under the Act.
  We do not consider that the relationships within our immediate supply chain give rise to material risks in this area. However, we will be requiring key suppliers to confirm that their activities accord with the requirements of the Act. 
  We also have a dedicated Compliance Officer, who oversees the above process.
Training
  The Firm has provided details of this policy to all relevant staff. We ensure that all employees, on joining the Firm and periodically thereafter, review and familiarise themselves with the Firm’s policies to ensure that they can identify situations where there is a risk of modern slavery or human trafficking.
Further steps
  Additional steps that we intend to take in order to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or supply chains are:

to develop and enhance existing policies (if any) or create new policies relating to slavery and human trafficking, in order to provide a framework for identifying and monitoring activities within our business and supply chains that may be in breach of such policies; 
to review our due diligence processes to ensure that they comply with our policies on slavery and human trafficking; and
to review current training provided in respect of our policies and their implementation and ensure the applicable level of training is delivered to employees so that they are more effective in identifying the existence or risk of slavery and human trafficking as part of the investment due diligence process.

  This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Lion Capital LLP’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 December 2016. It has been endorsed by the Operating Committee on behalf of the Firm.
