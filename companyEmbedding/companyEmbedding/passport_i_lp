Passport,             1984. Used ...
        

Temporarily Out Of Stock 
Add toWatch List
One of just a couple of albums by Leonard Cohen from  the 80s – certainly an underappreciated one,  in regard to his late 60s and early 70s canon – and that's a shame, because this is pretty brilliant stuff!  Stylistically, there's sparse folk pop, some steel guitar twang and then modern production touches that can't mess it up, thanks to the weight and gravity of Cohen's own voice and the beautiful female backup.  Titles include "The Night Comes On", "The Captain", "If It Be Your Will", "Dance Me To The End Of Love", "Coming Back To You" and "Hallelujah". LP, Vinyl record album (180 gram pressing on 4 Men With Beards.)

Joe Lovano —
            Bird Songs ... CD 

Blue Note,             2011. Used ...
        

Just Sold Out! 
Add toWatch List
Brilliant material from sax great Joe Lovano and his Us Five combo – a ceaselessly creative, energetic and involving batch inspired by Charle Parker – another great set from Lovano for Blue Note!  The greatest thing about Bird Songs is Lovano's own inspired takes on the material – bring fresh perspective to Bird's oeuvre – timeless, yet modern and taking the material to unexpected and unexplored flights.  The players include James Weidman, Esperanza Spalding, Otis Brown III and Francisco Mela – and the titles include "Passport", "Donna Lee", "Barbados", "Moose The Mooche", "Loverman", "Birdyard", "Dexterity", "Yardbird Suite" and more.

 Jean Jacques Perrey —
            Moog Indigo (180 gram pressing) ... LP 

Vanguard,             1970. New Copy (reissue)...
        

Out Of Stock 
Add toWatch List
An incredible record of funky moogy grooves – possibly one of the best of the genre!  Jean Jacques Perry really outdid himself on this record – going past the simple cut ups of his work with Gershon Kingsley, and hitting a style that was more groovy, and more song oriented.  The best example of this is the album's fantastic funky tune "EVA" – a monster break/moog cut that's been sampled by Gang Starr for "Just To Get A Rep", and more than a few other artists over the years!  The rest of the record's just as great – and cuts include "Soul City", "18th Century Puppet", "Gossipo Perpetuo", and "Passport To The Future". LP, Vinyl record album (HQ-180 pressing – by RTI!)

                    Forgot to mention, don't be put off by the atrocious artwork on most of the albums.  The musical content is the absolute antithesis of the artwork

                    I second the emotions below.  Passport and some of Doldinger's other output is well worth checking, especially as most of the original LPs  are criminally under valued. Personally I think the first 5 Passport LPs are near perfect, particularly if you like sax driven fusion. It is easy to label these as jazz fusion, but there is definitely a funkier edge to them with a definite krautrock feel on some of them. Tracks like Uranus, Schirokko and Yellow Dream most typify the general style and I almost fell off my chair when I heard Jadoo, superb drums on that track. The triple LP Doldinger Jubilee is also a good one to get as it is basically a musical biography of his work up to 1973.

                    Along with Cross-Collateral, this is by far my favorite Passport album. Doldinger is the title of Klaus Doldinger's first Passport album, and many times I've seen this early version of Passport (pre-Looking Thru) described as "a band finding their way" or the music is more "academic". I don't see that myself. Doldinger, aside from Doldinger himself, features a completely different lineup from the one that gave us Looking Thru, Cross-Collateral, Hand Made, and even Igacu (yes, Igacu still featured Doldinger, Kristian Schultze, Curt Cress, and Wolfgang Schmid, but also some new musicians, and Brazilian musicians helping too). Here you get Jimmy Jackson on keyboards (organ, the choir organ, and probably Mellotron), Lothar Meid on bass, Olaf Kubler on sax and flute, and Udo Lindenberg on drums. You might think perhaps it might sound a little like Amon Duul II with Doldinger's sax playing including (Meid and Jackson had played in ADII), but instead you get that unmistakable Passport sound, with some great cuts. "Uranus" is that opening cut, and there's even some Mellotron flute (I guess played by Jimmy Jackson, as he did play Mellotron on Embryo's Rache from around the same time period). "Nostalgia" features Jimmy Jackson's choir organ, that same weird choir sound you hear on ADII's Tanz der Lemminge (Dance of the Lemmings) and Wolf City, and Popol Vuh's Aguirre (I assume it was Florian Fricke who borrowed Jimmy's machine). "Continuation" has a bit of a more psychedelic edge than you usually expect from Passport, I especially dig those wah-wah sounds and clavinet. The album is very well produced, which was uncommon with many of the Krautrock releases of the time (which can be forgiven given many Krautrock acts of the time were on a limited budget). Of course, Passport isn't exactly Krautrock, it's jazz-rock/fusion, this one perhaps more on the jazz-rock side. If you want to look for some early Passport, don't be afraid to try these three albums (Doldinger, Second Passport, Hand Made), as they're all worthy albums too!

                    Although released in 1971, I find it interesting my copy, which has the same catalog number (ATL 40299) has a 1973 copyright. The 1973 copyright is found inside the gatefold, right below where it says, "Design + illustration by Wandrey's Studio Hamburg". That means it has to be a second pressing, I'm sure of it. Now I think of it, that's when Atlantic Records of Germany went under WEA Musik GmbH. The scan here doesn't appear to show the 1973 copyright, so I'm certain the scan is of the original pressing.

Specifications – Essence Pro



Product Description
The Asensetek Lighting Passport spectrometer combined with the SGE APP is a powerful tool capable of making a broad array of lighting measurements among which are a core set of metrics that are indispensable to anyone wishing to obtain a definitive understanding of any light source.
Illuminance in lux
CCT – Correlated colour temperature expressed in Kelvin
Chromaticity (an objective specification of the quality of a colour regardless of its luminance presented in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity space)
CRI Color Rendering Index. CRI is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reveal the colours of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. Light sources with a high CRI are desirable in colour-critical applications.
Knowledge of Illuminance, CRI, CCT and Chromaticity is critical when designing a lighting installation, verifying performance both post installation as well as in years to come; for example, when assessing compliance to lighting manufacturers’ performance guarantees.

Lowepro 50th - Adventure Awaits





The Passport Backpack from Lowepro will hold your compact system camera or DSLR with kit lens. It also features a separate CradleFit 13" laptop/tablet pocket that suspends and protects the device within a separate rear compartment. The pack also has room for an extra lens, flash, or Smartphone.The pack's interior can be customized for use as a backpack or daypack since it features a removable camera insert. The insert has movable touch-fastened dividers and a cover flap. Removing the insert provides you with one large interior storage area. When the insert is left in, your personals can be placed on top of it. Additional storage space is provided by a front zippered organizer pocket and an interior zippered mesh pocket. There are also two exterior water bottle pockets. The pack is made from nylon, and complimented by a padded mesh backpad. Zippers provide access to your gear and storage compartments. Adjustable, contoured shoulder straps and a top grab handle give you two carrying options.
