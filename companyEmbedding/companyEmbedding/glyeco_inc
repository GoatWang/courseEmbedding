Company






We are a leading specialty chemical company, leveraging technology and innovation to focus on vertically integrated, eco-friendly manufacturing, customer service and distribution solutions. Our eight facilities, including the recently acquired 14-20 million gallons per year, ASTM E1177 EG-1, glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia, deliver superior quality glycol products that meet or exceed ASTM quality standards, including a wide spectrum of ready to use antifreezes and additive packages for antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer fluid industry, throughout North America. Our team's extensive experience in the chemical field, including direct experience with reclamation of all types of glycols, gives us the ability to process a wide range of feedstock streams, formulate and produce unique products and has earned us an outstanding reputation in our markets.
We have two segments.  Consumer and Industrial. Consumer’s principal business activity is the processing of waste glycol into high-quality recycled glycol products, specifically automotive antifreeze, and related specialty blended antifreeze, which we sell in the automotive and industrial end markets. We operate six processing and distribution centers located in the eastern region of the United States. Industrial’s consists of two divisions. WEBA develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer industry, throughout North America and RS&T which operates a 14-20 million gallons per year, ASTM E1177 EG-1, glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia, which processes waste glycol into virgin quality recycled glycol for sale to industrial customers worldwide. 
Consumer segment
Our Consumer segment has processing and distribution centers located in (1) Minneapolis, Minnesota, (2) Indianapolis, Indiana, (3) Lakeland, Florida, (4) Rock Hill, South Carolina, (5) Tea, South Dakota, and (6) Landover, Maryland. The Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lakeland, Florida, Rock Hill, South Carolina and Tea, South Dakota facilities have distillation equipment and operations for recycling waste glycol streams as well as blending equipment and operations for mixing glycol and other chemicals to produce finished products for sale to third party customers, while the Indianapolis, Indiana and Landover, Maryland facilities currently only have blending equipment and operations for mixing glycol and other chemicals to produce finished products for sale to third party customers. We estimate that the monthly processing capacity of our four facilities with distillation equipment is approximately 100,000 gallons of ready to use finished products. We have invested significant time and money into increasing the capacity and actual production of our facilities. Our average monthly production was approximately 40,000 gallons in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to approximately 60,000 gallons in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our processing and distribution centers utilize a fleet of trucks to collect waste material for processing and delivering recycled glycol products directly to retail end users at their storefront, which is typically 50-100 gallons per customer order. Collectively, we directly service approximately 5,000 generators of waste glycol. To meet the delivery volume needs of our existing customers, we supplement our collected and processed glycol with new or virgin glycol that we purchase in bulk from various suppliers. In addition to our retail end users, we also sell our recycled glycol products to wholesale or bulk distributors who, in turn, sell to retail end users specifically as automotive or specialty blended antifreeze. In certain markets we also sell windshield washer fluids which we do not recycle.
We have deployed our proprietary technology across our six processing distribution centers, allowing for safe and efficient handling of waste streams, application of our processing technology and Quality Control & Assurance Program (“QC&A”), sales of high-quality glycol products, and data systems allowing for tracking, training, and further development of our products and service.
Our Consumer segment product offerings include:




 


·


High-Quality Recycled Glycols - Our technology allows us to produce glycols which meet ASTM standards and can be used in any industrial application.




 




 


·


Recycled Antifreeze - We formulate several universal recycled antifreeze products to meet ASTM and/or OEM manufacturer specifications for engine coolants. In addition, we custom blend recycled antifreeze to customer specifications.




 




 


·


Recycled HVAC Fluids - We formulate a universal recycled HVAC coolant to meet ASTM and/or OEM manufacturer specifications for heating, ventilation and air conditioning fluids. In addition, we custom blend recycled HVAC coolants to customer specifications.




 




 


·


Waste Glycol Disposal Services - Utilizing our fleet of collection/delivery trucks, we collect waste glycol from generators for recycling. We coordinate large batches of waste glycol to be picked up from generators and delivered to our processing centers for recycling or in some cases to be safely disposed.




 




 


·


Windshield Washer Fluid - In certain markets we sell windshield washer fluids which we do not recycle.




We currently sell and deliver all of our products in bulk containers (55 gallon barrels, 250 gallon totes, etc.) or variable metered bulk quantities. 
We began developing innovative new methods for recycling glycols in 1999. We recognized a need in the market to improve the quality of recycled glycol being returned to retail customers. In addition, we believed through process technology, systems, and footprint we could clean more types of waste glycol in a more cost efficient manner. Each type of industrial waste glycol contains a different list of impurities which traditional waste antifreeze processing does not clean effectively. Additionally, many of the contaminants left behind using these processes - such as esters, organic acids and high dissolved solids - leave the recycled material risky to use in vehicles or machinery.
Our proprietary and patented technology removes difficult pollutants, including esters, organic acids, high dissolved solids and high un-dissolved solids in addition to the benefit of clearing oil/hydrocarbons, additives and dyes that are typically found in used engine coolants. Our QC&A program (Quality Control & Assurance) seeks to ensure consistently high quality, ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standard compliant recycled material. Our products are trusted in all vehicle makes and models, regional fleet, local auto, and national retailers. Our proprietary QC&A program is managed and supported by dedicated process and chemical engineering staff, requires periodic onsite field audits, and ongoing training by our facility managing partners.
Industrial Segment
Our Industrial segment consists of two divisions: WEBA, our additives business and RS&T, our glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia.
WEBA develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer industry, throughout North America. We believe WEBA is one of the largest companies serving the North American additive market. WEBA's METALGUARD® additive package product line includes one-step inhibitor systems, which give our customers the ability to easily make various types of antifreeze concentrate and 50/50 coolants for all automobiles, heavy-duty diesel engines, stationary engines in gas patch and other applications. METALGUARD additive packages cover the entire range of coolant types from basic green conventional to the newest extended life OAT antifreezes of all colors. Our heat transfer fluid additives allow our customers to make finished heat transfer fluids for most industry applications including all-aluminum systems. The METALGUARD heat transfer fluids include light and heavy-duty fluids, both propylene and ethylene glycol based, for various operating temperatures. These inhibitors cover the industry standard of phosphate-based inhibitors as well as all-organic (OAT) inhibitors for specific pH range and aluminum system requirements.
All of the METALGUARD products are tested at our in-house laboratory facility and by third-party laboratories to assure conformance. We use the standards set by ASTM (American Society of Testing Materials) for all of our products. All of our products pass the most current ASTM standards and testing for each type of product. Our manufacturing facility conforms to the highest levels of process quality control including ISO 9001 certification.
RS&T operates a 14-20 million gallons per year, ASTM E1177 EG-1, glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia, which processes waste glycol into virgin quality recycled glycol for sale to industrial customers worldwide. The facility is uniquely designed to process industrial waste glycol. It utilizes the only currently active process that produces a product that both meets the virgin glycol antifreeze grade specification, ASTM E1177 EG-1, and achieves the important aesthetic requirement for most applications of having no odor. It is the largest glycol re-distillation plant in North America, with a capacity of 14-20 million gallons per year, several times higher processing capacity than the next largest glycol recycling facility. The facility, located at the Dow Institute Site in Institute, WV, includes five distillation columns, three wiped-film evaporators, heat exchangers, processing and storage tanks, and other processing equipment. The facility’s tanks include feedstock storage capacity of several million gallons and finished goods storage capacity of several million gallons. The plant is equipped with rail and truck unloading/loading facilities, and on-site barge loading/unloading facilities.

PHOENIX, June 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Sustainable glycol technologies leader GlyEco, Inc. (OTCQB: GLYE) ("GlyEco" or the "Company") has completed initial plant upgrades at its South Carolina plant and successfully processed and sold several thousand gallons of waste glycol sourced from the textile industry.
The worldwide textile industry is the largest consumer of monoethylene glycol, with demand exceeding 3.8 billion gallons annually. Glycols are used to create polyester fiber chips, the base material in plastic food and beverage containers, as well as polyester fabrics, carpets, and upholstery.
"We've made tremendous progress on our plant upgrades. I am very proud of what we have accomplished as a team, but I am even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, driven by customer needs in underserved markets," said John Lorenz, chairman and CEO of GlyEco. "We are well positioned to offer a real solution designed to help our customers create more environmentally friendly products, all while protecting their businesses from the threat of damage caused by improper waste glycol disposal."
Mr. Lorenz continued, "The waste glycol created by polyester manufacturing is difficult to clean. Most glycol recycling methods cannot remove all of the potentially deadly pollutants, while more effective processes don't make economic sense. As a result, textile manufacturers have very limited options for disposal, and at best this material ends up in a landfill. We intend to change that."
About GlyEco
GlyEco is a green chemistry company with a patent-pending technology for transforming a hazardous waste into green products. GlyEco Technology™ has the unique ability to clean the polluted glycols from all five waste-producing industries:  HVAC, Textiles, Automotive, Airline and Medical.  This technology recycles waste glycol to meet ASTM Type 1 specifications – the same level of purity expected of refinery-grade glycols.
This patent-pending technology enables our clients to handle the removal of their waste glycol in a responsible and environmentally safe manner.  Our clients can treat glycols as a more sustainable resource, recycling and re-using waste glycols repeatedly. Since most polluted glycol is disposed of in our surface waters - which can have devastating results for the environment, especially aquatic life - the GlyEco Technology™ solution gives our customers a way to reduce waste while caring for the environment, while reducing their costs.

About Glycol Recycling

Recycling waste glycols presents an inventive solution to supply shortages and increasing costs for refinery-produced material. Global consumption for refinery-produced ethylene glycol is over 5.5 billion gallons per year and climbing. GlyEco Technology™ is uniquely able to process all five sources of waste glycols, opening new avenues of supply. With proper handling, glycols can be recycled and reused indefinitely, creating the opportunity to utilize this valuable material as a predominately sustainable resource.

                        About Us
                    


The number of recyclers that can produce glycol pure enough to meet ASTM Type 1 standards can be counted on one hand. The number of recyclers who do it across as many industries and regions as we do, however, can be counted on one finger.
GlyEco stands alone.
We are the largest, most versatile, and most advanced glycol recycler in the world, and we’re working tirelessly to stay at the forefront of our industry so that we can make as big an impact on environmental conservation as possible.
Breakthrough TechnologyThe vast majority of glycol recyclers can only take used antifreeze glycols and restore them to ASTM Type 2 standards, so that they can only be used again as antifreeze.
In contrast, we are able to recycle spent and contaminated glycols from a variety of industries, including automotive, HVAC, textiles, aeronautics, and health care. And we can produce glycols pure enough to be considered equivalent to newly made glycols.
The old limits no longer apply.
Unprecedented QualityMeeting Type 1 standards using almost any source glycol is only the beginning. The GlyEco Comprehensive Quality Control-Assurance (QCA) Program ensures that we consistently produce an impressive, high-quality recycled glycol in a cost-effective manner. 
The QCA Program includes independent lab testing for compliance with ASTM standards, documented compliance with the EPA Hazardous Waste Manifest System (as well as all state and local regulations), and other policies and practices that ensure that we reliably meet or exceed our goals.
Expanding FootprintGlyEco is the only multiple-region recycler in the world, with five strategically placed locations across the United States. We are the only multi-region recycler in the world.
And we are growing. The company is bringing on more recycling plants this year to serve our existing clients, and offer recycling services to additional industries.
Unique IntelligenceOur Chief Technology Officer, has over 30 years of experience in the glycol industry, and is a former head of the ASTM's Coolant Division. Rounding out our management team are senior chemical engineers and plant managers who are some of the most sophisticated antifreeze recycling experts in the world.
Our team is ready to tackle the industry’s thorniest problems head on.





                        Why Recycle Glycols?
                    


The EPA lists glycol as a hazardous waste and estimates only 12% of used antifreeze is recycled. Statistics for other industries are not reported, and the vast majority of waste glycol is disposed of without documentation - very likely in a way that damages our environment. GlyEco Techology® transforms this hazardous waste into viable green products. With this patent-pending technology most of this hazardous waste can be cleaned and reused again and again.
Recycling waste glycol conserves a costly limited resource and is safer for the environment.
Glycol is a hazardous waste which ranks #23 on the National Pollutant Inventory Substance Profile. During use, glycols become contaminated with dirt, metals and oils which increase their toxicity and can contaminate soils and natural water. Glycols break down in water over a few days to a couple weeks. Because of this rapid biodegradability, the EPA allows disposal by 'release to surface waters'. However, when glycols break down in water they deplete oxygen levels, which kills fish and other aquatic life. The immediate effect of exposure to ethylene glycol can mean death for humans, animals, birds, fish & plants.
Protects Children, Animals, Fish and Plants 
We think recycling can mitigate potential liability as well as reduce costs and boost public image. Some of the contaminents found in used glycols, such as Cadmium and Lead, are considered very dangerous for our environment. The National Waste Minimization Program has included these contaminents in their 31 Priority Chemicals targeted to be eliminated from our industrial waste. GlyEco Technology™ effectively removes these contaminents from all five industrial glycol waste streams and allows for their proper disposal.

For many years, the only glycols recycled in any meaningful amount were antifreeze glycols. The rest of the world’s glycol waste was simply dumped into the ground or into a body of water.
Now, with our patent-pending process, we are able to recycle glycols from a wide variety of industries, including automotive, HVAC, aeronautics, textiles, and health care. And, after years of research and development, our products are purer than ever before, meeting ASTM Type 1 standards reliably and cost-effectively. That is, our glycols can be put to any use that newly produced glycol can be put to, and we have a process for recycling almost 100% of the world’s glycol waste.
Our inventive technology removes challenging pollutants, including esters, organic acids, high dissolved solids and high undissolved solids. Our technology has the added benefit of deftly clearing oil/hydrocarbons, additives and dyes which are typically found in used engine coolants. A rigorous quality assurance and control program which includes independent lab testing ensures consistently high quality, ASTM standard compliant recycled material our customers can rely on.

(OTC PINK: GLYE) ("GlyEco" or the "Company"), a leader in sustainable glycol technologies, announced agreements today to acquire WEBA Technology Corp. ("WEBA"), a privately-owned company that develops, manufactures, and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants, and heat transfer industries; and Recovery Solutions & Technologies Inc. ("RS&T"), a privately-owned company involved in the development and commercialization of glycol recovery technology. In addition, RS&T has signed an agreement to purchase certain glycol distillation assets from Union Carbide Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company ("Dow"), at Institute, West Virginia, with the transaction expected to close on December 28, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.The combination of GlyEco, WEBA, and RS&T brings together leading, complementary components to form a leading provider of vertically integrated glycol solutions, well positioned to shape the future of glycol production, process technology, and product delivery. The combined Company will manage a broad continuum of ethylene glycol solutions, including retail direct delivery and pick-up, ASTM E1177 Type EG-1 engine coolant grade ethylene glycol production, and the ability to formulate unique additive products to produce finished fluids that meet ASTM and industry specifications.Mr. Ian Rhodes, Chief Executive Officer and President, said, "At GlyEco, we have been actively advancing our glycol-focused strategies, while WEBA has been diversifying and building its national additive product lines for making antifreeze/coolant for light-duty automotive to heavy-duty diesel vehicles, and water/glycol heat transfer fluids for HVAC heating and air conditioning systems. Our two organizations complement each other in a way few others could, and the glycol distillation assets RS&T will acquire will allow us to become the first vertically integrated glycol solutions provider in North America."Mr. Rhodes continued, "This acquisition strategy will accelerate our collective ability to positively impact ethylene glycol production and delivery across the country. The transaction and related human resources will significantly increase our ability to implement and improve on our patented technology and better service our expanding client relationships in our direct delivery, bulk, and service verticals. Our Company competes in a highly-fragmented marketplace and we will now have the critical first mover advantage to capitalize on reselling opportunities across our various offerings, and generate significant value for our shareholders. We are excited for the future and look forward to the opportunity to combine the resources of these great companies."The Company expects to finance these transactions with cash on hand and debt, including a private placement of notes.About GlyEco, Inc.
