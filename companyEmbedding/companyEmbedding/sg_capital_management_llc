		Shares
		

Shares, also known as equities, provide you with part-ownership of a company. When you invest in shares, you are buying 'a share' of that business. Companies issue shares to raise money and investors buy shares in companies they believe will do well. The investor will then, in turn, share in the success. 
			
Investing in shares has been one of the most popular methods of investing surplus capital for hundreds of years. Belgium boasts the very first stock exchange dating back to 1531. As the years have gone by the world has seen global stock markets grow phenominally, in size, popularity, and accessibility. 
			
SG Capital Management can now offer access to 36 stock exchanges with data available for over 10,000 equities. 
			
Clients can take advantage of our trading team providing professional execution for share dealing, for both advisory and execution-only accounts. 
			
			Please remember that the value of investments can fall as well as rise. Trading carries a high level of risk to your capital, and is not suitable for all investors. Please ensure you fully understand the risks, and seek independent advice if necessary.
		



		Bonds
		

A bond is a debt investment in which an investor loans money to an entity, typically a government, local authority or a corporate entity. The entity borrows the capital for a defined period of time at a fixed or variable rate of interest. The interest is paid at the agreed intervals during the period of lending and the initial principle, or the borrowed amount, is repaid upon the expiry of the bond. 
			
Bonds are widely used in today's market to raise money for a variety of reasons, such as acquisition, investment, and new projects. 
			
SG Capital Management provide access to 7000 different bonds across 26 countries spanning government bonds, corporate bonds and more.
		


		Please remember that the value of investments can fall as well as rise. Trading carries a high level of risk to your capital, and is not suitable for all investors. Please ensure you fully understand the risks, and seek independent advice if necessary.	
		



		Futures
		


A futures contract is a contractual obligation for the buyer to purchase an asset, and the seller to sell the asset, at an agreed price at an agreed time at some point in the future. 
			
They are standardised contracts that will detail the asset itself, the quantity, the price and the predetermined future date. 
			
The futures market originated in North America 150 years ago, however before this time farmers would agree to sell their crop at a specific price for a forward delivery date, thus allowing the farmer to control cash flow and finances and the buyer to plan ahead. For example, a wheat farmer may have entered into a futures contract with a local brewery. 
			
Today's futures market is vast and is not only for agricultural goods, but also for financial instruments, commodities, currencies, securities, bonds, and much more. 
			
SG Capital Management offer over 200 futures contracts across a wide variety of different sectors.
			
		Please remember that the value of investments can fall as well as rise. Trading carries a high level of risk to your capital, and is not suitable for all investors. Please ensure you fully understand the risks, and seek independent advice if necessary.
		



		Options
		

An option, or options contract, is a contractual agreement giving the buyer the right, but not the obligations, to purchase an asset at an agreed price on a predetermined future date. 
			
An option is a lot like a futures contract, however there are a couple of important differences. A futures contract is a legally binding agreement for the transaction to take place on a future date. An option does not bind the buyer to purchase the asset, they instead have the option to buy. 
			
For the privilege of choosing if they would like to purchase the asset or not, the buyer will pay an upfront premium for the option. Should they choose not to exercise the option upon the agreed date they can walk away from the contract with their risk limited to only the premium paid. 
			
One would exercise an option should the price of the asset be higher than the pre-agreed price set out in the options contract.
			
		Please remember that the value of investments can fall as well as rise. Trading carries a high level of risk to your capital, and is not suitable for all investors. Please ensure you fully understand the risks, and seek independent advice if necessary.

		Forex
		

		currency to purchase another. The currency you are selling is the 'base currency' and the currency you are buying is the 'quote currency'. The rate of exchange indicates how much you need to spend of one currency to buy the other. 
			
A long position means you are buying the base currency and selling the quote currency. 
			
A short position means you want to buy the quote currency and sell the base currency. 
			
The exchange rate will always be quoted in two prices, the bid and the offer. The 'spread' is the difference between these two prices. 
			
Movements in the foreign exchange market can be caused by a multitude of things; the strength of a countries economy, monetary policy, politics, regulation, employment, inflation and much more. The objective when trading foreign exchange is to analyse and calculate which currencies will be stronger or weaker than others. 
			
Forex is now the world's most traded market with an average turnover in excess of five trillion dollars per day. Forex is a decentralised market, therefore traded 'Over the Counter' (OTC). 
			
Trading Forex with SG Capital Management, clients can choose from a broad range of currency pairs, including majors, minors, and exotics. Clients can also take advantage of:			


Fast execution
No re-quotes
Risk management tools
Order combinations, such as trailing stops and OCOs (Order Cancels Other)

		Spread Betting
		

Spread betting is a derivatives product that allows you to trade on the price movements of thousands of financial instruments including indices, equity shares, currencies and commodities. In simple terms, spread betting is a tax-free alternative to conventional trading that enables you to speculate on rising as well as falling market prices. Under current UK tax legislation spread betting is free from Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Stamp Duty Tax. Tax laws are subject to change. 
			
The main difference compared with a conventional share trade is the method of how the trade is undertaken. Rather than purchase a number of shares, the trade is taken by speculating x amount of pounds per tick. If you think the price will rise, you go long. Your position will then profit from the price rising and lose from the price falling, just like shares. Inversely, if you think a price will fall, you go short. Your position will then profit from the price falling and lose from the price rising.

			CFDs
		

A Contract for Difference (CFD) is an agreement between two parties to exchange the difference between the opening price and closing price of the contract. Contracts for Difference have been traded by institutions in the market for many years. Historically, they have been used by hedge funds to take 'short' positions to allow hedging and speculation on falling prices. Over the last twenty years the product has become increasingly available for individual investors and is now accessible to all categories of investor via online platforms. CFDs are essentially a derivative, however they are very easy to understand and offer several features that are attracting investors over the ordinary share. 
			
Features of CFD Trading 

No Stamp Duty Tax - CFDs are not liable for UK Stamp Duty Tax, therefore providing investors a saving on every equity purchase. 
			
Long and Short positions - CFDs provide investors the facility to take both long and short positions. This allows the investor to speculate on both rising and falling prices. It also gives the investor an option to hedge against other exposure. 
			
Trade a wide range of assets - it is not only equities that can be traded through CFDs, investors can take advantage of a wide variety of asset classes across global markets. Investors can also trade bonds, options, futures, commodities, indices and foreign currencies, all from one account. 
			
Trade on margin - margin is the industry term for deposit. In simple terms, the investor is only required to put up a deposit to place the trade rather than the full cash capital. i.e. buying £10,000 of HSBC would require a deposit of 10%, therefore only £1000 cash capital would be taken from the CFD account to hold the position. 
			
There are no time restraints on how long an investor can hold a CFD position for. A position can be held for 10 minutes or 10 years, this is a decision that the investor can make at their own will. There is, however, a charge for holding positions overnight, which should be considered when holding positions for longer periods of time. 	
			
Shares vs. CFDs




Please note: The profit/loss figures above are gross figures. The relevant charges for the service would also need to be considered.
