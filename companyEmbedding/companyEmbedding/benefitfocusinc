The power to protect.




















StoryLeadershipCultureCareersEventsPress RoomInvestors 









ContactJobs 










We knew there was a better way for the 21st century.

Before 2000, choosing benefits meant sifting through piles of paper, not having the resources to understand or compare plans and then hoping you picked the right one. That’s why when we launched Benefitfocus, we had one goal: to give people the knowledge, options and freedom to protect what they love most. This idea is what has propelled Benefitfocus to become the most trusted benefits management platform in the world.
It’s not just technology. It’s peace of mind.

Founded with a vision for simplifying benefits enrollment
 










2004

OUR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY



We are dreamers. We dream of the stress sliding off like mud when you realize the way you work is about to change. We dream about the smile spreading from you to your entire organization—one simple, elegantly designed screen at a time. 
Engineering beautiful simplicity. Engineering smiles. 
Design + Engineering Blog 






























 






COMMUNITY



We believe you don’t have to choose between doing business and doing good. That’s why aside from creating technology to help people protect what they love most, we invest in our community. From nurturing our internal culture to volunteering in local and national efforts, we’re doing our best to leave everything just a little bit better than how we found it.

The company is based in Charleston, South Carolina.

A lot of overlap exists between internal IT and product-side IT at Benefitfocus.com, which provides a cloud-based platform for companies to manage benefits for their employees. The Chief Technology Officer sits atop all technology-related groups and teams but is not involved in many individual initiatives. Most internal IT takes place within the Software Engineering division or the Database Engineering division. Those employees work out of the headquarters in Charleston, SC, and a secondary office in Greenville, SC.

IT Security operates out of the Software Engineering group and keeps procedures to meet HIPAA requirements, deliver security awareness training, and implementation of a disaster recovery plan. Data Center Engineers, part of the Database Engineering group, are responsible for developing, maintaining and executing an infrastructure capacity plan. The company’s requirements for its cloud continue to change and grow with more customers.

The company also fields a Technology Product Development division that coordinates the teams concentrating on internal IT. RainKing currently does not profile anyone in that division.

The power to protect.




















StoryLeadershipCultureCareersEventsPress RoomInvestors 









ContactJobs 










We knew there was a better way for the 21st century.

Before 2000, choosing benefits meant sifting through piles of paper, not having the resources to understand or compare plans and then hoping you picked the right one. That’s why when we launched Benefitfocus, we had one goal: to give people the knowledge, options and freedom to protect what they love most. This idea is what has propelled Benefitfocus to become the most trusted benefits management platform in the world.
It’s not just technology. It’s peace of mind.












2000



Founded with a vision for simplifying benefits enrollment
 










2004



100,000 consumers on platform
 












2013



Publicly traded on NASDAQ under "BNFT"
 










2015



Campus expansion to Customer Success Center
 































 






OUR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY



We are dreamers. We dream of the stress sliding off like mud when you realize the way you work is about to change. We dream about the smile spreading from you to your entire organization—one simple, elegantly designed screen at a time. 
Engineering beautiful simplicity. Engineering smiles. 
Design + Engineering Blog 






























 






COMMUNITY



We believe you don’t have to choose between doing business and doing good. That’s why aside from creating technology to help people protect what they love most, we invest in our community. From nurturing our internal culture to volunteering in local and national efforts, we’re doing our best to leave everything just a little bit better than how we found it.
