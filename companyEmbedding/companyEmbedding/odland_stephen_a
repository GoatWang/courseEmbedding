Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
He received his Bachelor’s of Business Administration from The University of Notre Dame, and a Master's of Management degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[2]
Career[edit]
Since 2013 he has been President and CEO of the Committee for Economic Development, a non-partisan, business-led public policy organization that delivers well-researched analysis and reasoned solutions to the nation’s most critical issues.[3] The organization has a research and outreach portfolio focused on taxation and regulation[4]; the national debt[5]; health care[6]; corporate diversity[7]; early childhood,[8] K-12,[9] and postsecondary education[10]; campaign finance[11]; immigration[12]; and infrastructure.[13] CED’s membership consists primarily of CEOs and other senior business leaders from a range of sectors across the U.S.
In 2017, in collaboration with Joseph Minarik, Senior Vice President and Director of Research at CED, Odland co-authored Sustaining Capitalism: Bipartisan Solutions to Restore Trust & Prosperity.[14] The book lays out a clear plan for how business and policy leaders can generate prosperity for business and society now, all while making capitalism sustainable for generations to come. The book received coverage by, among other publications, Fortune,[15] Yahoo! Finance,[16] Bloomberg,[17] and CNBC.[18]
Steve began his career at the Quaker Oats Company.[19] From 1981 to 1996 he progressed through various positions and divisions at Quaker including pet foods, Golden Grain, international foods, and cereals. From 1996-1998 he served as President of the Foodservice Division of Sara Lee Bakery.[20] He subsequently became President and CEO of Tops Markets, a position he held until 2000.[21]
From 2001-2005 Odland was President, Chairman, and CEO of AutoZone.[22] At the end of his tenure, AutoZone had over $5.6B in net sales, and approximately 3,500 stores and 45,000 employees across the U.S. and Mexico.[23] He established the first corporate governance guidelines at the company. To drive teamwork and accountability he enacted, among other initiatives, the “40-headed CEO,” in which every month the 40 most senior executives (hence the "40-headed CEO”) convened for a half a day to review the company’s operations, performance, and financials.[24]
He was named top new CEO in 2002 by Bloomberg Markets Magazine.[25]
From 2005-2010 Odland was Chairman and CEO of Office Depot.[26] During his tenure he implemented award-winning environmental initiatives ranging from green products to green buildings and energy saving measures.[27] His commitment to diversity, including at the top echelons of the company, resulted in several awards and other accolades. The National Association for Female Executives named Office Depot as one of the top 30 companies dedicated to the advancement of women executives[28]; the Women’s Business Development Council named it the Florida Corporation of The Year[29]; DiversityBusiness.com recognized the company as one of the top for multicultural business opportunities.[30] Also, Office Depot’s Supply Chain Diversity team published a catalog to exclusively feature Historically Underutilized Businesses – a first for the industry and one of the few such efforts in all of retailing.[31] In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Office Depot Foundation donated $10,000 to Doctors Without Borders to provide medical supplies; it also donated $10,000 to Feed The Children.[32]
He is the 2007 recipient of Florida Atlantic University’s Business Leader of the Year.[33]
From 2011 to 2012 he taught as an Adjunct Professor in the graduate schools of business at Florida Atlantic University and Lynn University.[34]
He is profiled in the books, Nobodies to Somebodies: How 100 Great Careers Got Their Start,[35] and Leaders on Ethics: Real-world Perspectives on Today’s Business Challenges.[36]
He currently is a Director of General Mills, Inc.[37] and Analogic Corporation.[38] He is a Senior Advisor at Peter J. Solomon Company,[39] a Trustee of The Conference Board,[40] and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[41]
Odland is a Contributor to CNBC[42] and The Hill,[43] and a former Contributor to Forbes.[44]
He has been a member of the Business Roundtable and Chairman of its Corporate Governance Taskforce[45]; a U.S. Presidential Appointee as commissioner on the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission[46]; a member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation[47]; a U.S. Presidential Appointee on the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation[48]; a member of the Advisory Council of the Institute for Corporate Ethics[49]; a member of the Advisory Council of the University of Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business[50]; Chairman of Memphis Tomorrow[51]; and a member of the Florida Council of 100.[52]

Welcome to Woodlands Animal Hospital

Thank you for choosing Woodlands Animal Hospital. We are dedicated to the health and wellness of your pet. Having a great 
						relationship with your veterinarian is one of the key elements to ensuring that your pet has a full and healthy life. Steven 
						Odland, DVM, and the entire staff at the Woodlands Animal Hospital in Oldsmar, FL treat your animal as one of our own and 
						are committed to giving you and your pet personal and professional service.
						
What People Are Saying
"Want a doctor who really cares, Dr. O is the best!: Exceptional Staff and Service. This office will keep your pet happy!"
"Absolutely Wonderful. When we moved here I needed to find a new vet for my dog. Dr. O is kind and caring and so gentle with my dog. 
						I would not go any other place."
"A Doctor who not only possesses the gift of healing but also the heart of loving. When you meet the staff and Dr Odland, you will 
						note quickly, the love of animals within the walls. They care as much as you do. The quality of care is of the highest level and the 
						pricing is of the fairest level. They are out to make your pet better and cover the cost of doing so. There is no lack of trust nor 
						concern within this organization. Dr Odland and staff have their own family pets present during the day and are more than happy to 
						bring you into the back rooms, such as the kennel as there is nothing to hide. The place is very clean and full of love. Please give 
						them a try. I did and will never seek out another Vet for my wonderfully handsome Standard Poodle."
"Dr. Odland is awesome. I have been going to him for 10+ years and I think he's the best. His rates are reasonable but more 
						importantly he has "bedside" manner when it comes to your pets. My dog actually likes to come to see him! The staff is wonderful 
						too and all of them are so very caring. I highly recommend him if you are looking for the best care for your beloved pet!"
"I tried numerous Dr.'s in the area but none compare with Dr. Odland. He is fantastic with animals, like a visit with the real 
						Dr. Doolittle. A pleasure to take my dog to him. The staff is also fantastic and the office is immaculate. I would recommend 
						him to anyone looking for a great doctor for your animal."
"They really go above and beyond to make me feel special. I've never been anywhere that seems to care more about their clients than 
						here. I was so impressed with the progress I was able to make after visiting them. All my questions were answered, and I feel a lot 
						more confident and hopeful about the future. When I arrived for my appointment the friendly staff seemed to be waiting for me. 
						I've been to other places where I had to wait forever after I arrived for my appointment, but not here. I was very impressed."
"A Doctor who not only possesses the gift of healing but also the heart of loving. When you meet the staff and Dr. Odland, you 
						will note quickly, the love of animals within the walls. They care as much as you do. The quality of care is of the highest 
						level and the pricing is of the fairest level…"
"We love this place!... My rottweiler loved going there for many years and now my 2 pitbulls love it!! A great family owned 
						place that really cares!!! This is thee Vet to go to if you are in the area! :)"
"Our border collie Maxx first visited Dr. Odland with a bad skin allergy and sand fleas which he 
						had never come in contact with before we came to this area. His usually lush, long hair was bald 
						in his hind quarters and tail and thanks to the excellent care of Dr. Odland and his staff within 
						weeks he was well and in 6 weeks he was his handsome self again. We have returned many times and 
						will continue to visit this friendly, accurate, caring, and fairly priced vet!!"
"Excellent DVM, with the knowledge and capable staff to deal with any and all emergencies as well as preventive measures."
"I have been going to Dr. Odland for years. I highly recommend him. He truly cares about your pets and has excellent "bed side 
						manner"! If you are looking for a vet that will take excellent care of your pet for a reasonable cost, this is your vet."

Stephen Curry plans to visit a West Oakland elementary school next month, but the Warriors superstar and idol to kids everywhere won’t be promoting three-pointers.
He’ll be pitching water filters — an arrangement that critics say raises questions about the insinuation of advertising into schools.
Curry is scheduled to visit Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School on March 8, appearing at a school assembly planned and promoted by Brita, which sells a variety of water-filtration products. The subsidiary of Clorox signed a three-year endorsement deal with the Warriors’ point guard in December.

Brita is inviting reporters to the assembly, in hopes of generating news coverage that would reach an even larger audience.
The appearance is linked to a national “Drink Up” campaign that encourages water consumption rather than sugary alternatives. The effort is sponsored by numerous for-profit companies that sell water or water products, including Brita — and encourages supporters to buy the sponsors’ products online.
While many sports stars visit schools, most do so independently or while aligned with a nonprofit organization or educational activity. Curry’s appearance is directly tied to a company and a product he’s being paid to endorse.
That’s a problem, said Josh Golin, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which is based in Boston.
Branding is the problem
Events like this “are really designed to get kids to go home and nag their parents for the water filter Steph Curry is telling them to buy,” Golin said. “I would absolutely say if this was a nonprofit promoting water consumption I would have no problem with it. It’s the branding” that is problematic.
Schools have long been considered fertile ground for corporate marketers. Branding efforts have included product placement in textbooks, company logos on donated scoreboards and sponsorship of school events.
In recent years, though, many school districts have beefed up policies to prevent such activities from penetrating campuses and class time.
In Oakland, district officials said Wednesday that the Curry appearance does not violate a district policy.
While school officials are mindful of potential exploitation, the benefits of having Curry visit the school and encourage children to make the healthy choice of drinking water is a good thing, said board member Jumoke Hinton Hodge, who represents West Oakland.
“I think they’re going to hear Steph Curry say drinking water is good for you,” she said. “I can’t find a problem with it. I’m OK with it. I’m very OK with it.”
Isaac Kos-Read, a district spokesman, said, “We’re excited that a world-class athlete such as Steph Curry has chosen to highlight the healthy option of drinking water, and that he’s doing so at one of our West Oakland schools.”
Curry has in the past two years become one of the most marketable athletes in the world, with an estimated $10 million in annual endorsement deals. He said he chose to sign with Brita because he wants to promote water rather than soda or sports drinks. 
Curry chooses water
“Drinking water is essential to a healthy lifestyle,” Curry said in a statement announcing the endorsement deal. “Water is my drink. I like that Brita makes tap water taste good, so you don’t need to spend money or waste plastic with bottled water.”
Jennifer Harris, a food marketing researcher at the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, noted that there is “a lot of marketing in schools and most of it is for soda and candy, sports drinks and fast food. Water is better than all of those things.”
However, she said, Brita is pitching a product to school kids through one of their biggest heroes.
“A lot of companies want to be there, because where else could a company reach every child in that neighborhood?” Harris said. “In this case it’s just pure marketing.”
Marketing in schools is a corporate no-brainer, said Faith Boninger, an expert in commercial activities in schools at the National Education Policy Center in Boulder, Colo.
In October, when actor Jack Black visited a Minnesota school to promote his new movie, “Goosebumps,” school officials showed a preview of the film to students who donned matching “Goosebumps” shirts as local media documented the event.
“Schools provide a relatively uncluttered marketing space, where the child audience is not only captive, but is also … predisposed to be favorable to marketing messages that the children assume the adults who supervise them have approved for them,” Boninger said.
She added that kids “would also be likely to listen to and be favorable toward anything Steph Curry is promoting.”
Brita officials said Wednesday that they won’t be speaking to the students during the event or delivering any commercial messages.
“Beyond promoting Brita products, our relationship with Stephen Curry focuses on reinforcing the benefits of water as part of a healthy lifestyle,” said David Kargas, a company spokesman. “With his help, we can reach more people with the message that water is the best beverage for health.”
Principal Roma Groves said the visit aligns with the school’s effort to promote healthy living in a disadvantaged community
“No more sodas, not even juices,” she said. “We’re promoting water at our school.”
School gets filters
The district said the school is receiving a benefit from Brita, with the company planning to donate and install water filters at the school during the event.
Oakland schools get their water from the East Bay Municipal Utility District, whose supply comes almost entirely from a Sierra Nevada watershed. Officials emphasized there is nothing wrong with the water flowing out of school taps.
