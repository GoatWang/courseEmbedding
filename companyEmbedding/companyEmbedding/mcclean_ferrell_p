Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Dominion fights to get nuclear in Connecticut power procurement plan
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    4:20 PM ET 07/13/2017
                                                


Dominion Energy Inc (D) said on Thursday it would keep fighting to get the Connecticut legislature to include power from the company's Millstone nuclear plant included in a state energy procurement plan. But NRG Energy Inc (NRG) vowed to fight Dominion's proposal, calling it "a cynical scheme that should not be rewarded."

NRG stock extended gains for a third session, up nearly 43% in that span.
