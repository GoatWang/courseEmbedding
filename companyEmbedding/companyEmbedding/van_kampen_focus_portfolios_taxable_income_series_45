REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF VAN KAMPEN FUNDS INC. AND THE UNITHOLDERS OF
VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS, SERIES 248 (THE ROARING 2000sSM PORTFOLIO,
TRADITIONAL SERIES 8):


We have audited the accompanying statements of condition (including the
analyses of net assets) and the related portfolio of Van Kampen Focus
Portfolios, Series 248 (The Roaring 2000sSM Portfolio, Traditional Series 8) as
of October 31, 2001 and the related statements of operations and changes in net
assets for the period from December 12, 2000 (date of deposit) through October
31, 2001. These statements are the responsibility of the Trustee and the
Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on such statements based on
our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned at October
31, 2001 by correspondence with the Trustee. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee and
the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Van Kampen Focus Portfolios,
Series 248 (The Roaring 2000sSM Portfolio, Traditional Series 8) as of October
31, 2001 and the results of operations and changes in net assets for the period
from December 12, 2000 (date of deposit) through October 31, 2001, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



OCTOBER 31, 2001





NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Security Valuation - Securities are valued at the last closing sales price
or, if no such price exists, at the closing bid price thereof.


Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust of the Securities was based,
for Securities listed on a national securities exchange on the closing sale
prices on the exchange or the closing asked prices if not listed. The cost was
determined on the day of the various Dates of Deposit.


Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of
being collected, (2) the Securities in the Trust based on the value as described
in Note 1 and (3) accumulated dividends thereon, less accrued expenses of the
Trust, if any.


Federal Income Taxes - Each Unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro
rata portion of the Trust and, accordingly, no provision has been made for
Federal income taxes.


Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are
reported on an identified cost basis.


New Accounting Pronouncements - On December 1, 2000, the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants issued a new audit and accounting guide for
Investment Companies. The revised guide codifies new accounting standards on
several issues, including amortization of premium or discount on debt securities
and accounting for offering costs. Changes required by the guide are to be
applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2000. Amortization of premium or discount on debt securities will
result in a reclassification of amounts previously recognized in unrealized
gains or losses to net investment income. Trusts with unamortized offering costs
are to apply the provisions relating to offering costs as a cumulative effect of
the change charged or credited directly to Net Asset Value to Unitholders. The
trustee and the sponsor believe that the adoption of the provisions in the guide
will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the trust.





NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO



Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) at October 31, 2001 is as follows:






Unrealized Appreciation       $        24,359
Unrealized Depreciation           (1,315,534)
                              ----------------
                              $   (1,291,175)
                              ================









NOTE 3- OTHER



Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase Units at
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the value of the Securities in
the portfolio of the Trust valued as described in Note 1, plus accumulated
dividends to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or
for other business reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at
such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a
Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by
tendering such units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.


Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on adding to the
underlying value of the Securities per Unit on the date of an investor's
purchase, plus an amount equal to the difference between the maximum sales
charge of 3.25% of the public offering price which is equivalent to 3.359% of
the aggregate underlying value of the Securities . On December 12, 2001, the
secondary sales will be 2.75%.


Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.0025 per Unit, not to
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to all
applicable Trusts). The Evaluator receives and annual fee for regularly
evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under
the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index.



NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS



During the period ended October 31, 2001, 14,364 Units were presented for
redemption.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of the
Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus.


Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.



THE TRUST





The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a
Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the Initial
Date of Deposit among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as Sponsor, Van Kampen Investment
Advisory Corp., as Supervisor, The Bank of New York, as Trustee, and, for
certain Trusts, as Evaluator or their predecessors. Effective April 23, 2001,
American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a division of Van Kampen Investment
Advisory Corp., resigned as Evaluator and The Bank of New York was appointed
successor Evaluator. Trusts created after this time do not have a separate
Evaluator. The Bank of New York performs evaluation services for these Trusts in
its role as Trustee.


The Trust offers investors the opportunity to purchase Units representing
proportionate interests in a portfolio of actively traded equity securities. The
Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a
portfolio of stocks with greater diversification than they might be able to
acquire individually.


On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as
provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will terminate on the Mandatory
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this Prospectus the term
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these
securities) listed in "Portfolio" in Part One for the Trust and any additional
securities deposited into the Trust.


Additional Units of the Trust may be issued at any time by depositing in the
Trust (i) additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities together
with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit)
with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional Units are
issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the Securities will be increased and
the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be decreased.
The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust following
the Initial Date of Deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in
amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same percentage
relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the Trust's
portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit. Investors
may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their
anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees.


Each Unit of the Trust initially offered represents an undivided interest in
the Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee or
additional Units are issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited
by the Sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by
each unredeemed Unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual
interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until
redeemed upon tender to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the
Sponsor, or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


The Trust consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the
purchase thereof) listed under the "Portfolio" in Part One as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Trust, (b) any additional Securities acquired and
held by the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any
cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the Securities.







OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION





The Trust invests in a portfolio of stocks selected using concepts outlined
in The Roaring 2000s written by Harry S. Dent, Jr. The Trust seeks to increase
the value of your investment over its life.


The Roaring 2000s is the third book written by Harry S. Dent, Jr. analyzing
economic, technological and demographic trends in society. We designed the Trust
to take advantage of the insights, philosophies and strategies discussed in this
book. Based on Mr. Dent's current analysis, the portfolio focuses on stocks from
four sectors: Technology, Financials, Health Care and U.S.-based
Multi-Nationals. The Trust seeks to leverage demographic, economic and lifestyle
trends that may develop over the next 10-15 years. According to Mr. Dent, some
significant changes that may potentially impact the future economy include:


o    Aging Baby Boomers reaching their peak spending years


o    Internet usage and new technologies becoming more mainstream


o    A shift in the business and organizational structure brought on by the
Information Age


o    Rising importance of small- to medium-sized, high growth companies


o    Growth opportunities from continued global economic development


Mr. Dent believes that the coming years may bring an era of economic
prosperity and lifestyle changes. For instance, Mr. Dent believes that the
Internet may be as important a catalyst for change in business as the
assembly-line once was for production. Mr. Dent applies the principle of the
"S-curve" in analyzing technologies and social trends in the economy. This
concept shows how products move into mainstream acceptance. The S-curve shows
how products develop in three stages over time: Innovation, Growth and Maturity.
Mr. Dent also focuses on the "spending wave". This analysis illustrates how our
economy has correlated closely with birth rates. Over time, the level of births
lagged for peak in family spending has almost paralleled the Dow Jones
Industrial Average adjusted for inflation.


Of course, we cannot guarantee that the Trust will achieve its objective. The
value of your Units may fall below the price you paid for the Units. You should
read the "Risk Factors" section before you invest.


Using extensive research developed from years of hands-on business
experience, Mr. Dent seeks to offer a positive and understandable view of trends
in society. He proposes practical applications at all levels: from personal
investments, to business strategies, to jobs and changes in the workplace, to
growth areas for real estate. Mr. Dent received his MBA from Harvard Business
School where he was a Baker Scholar. He graduated number one in his class at the
University of South Carolina with a degree in accounting and finance. Mr. Dent
has worked as a consultant with several Fortune 100 companies to develop and
innovate competitive business strategies. He has been CEO of several growth
companies and has acted as consultant to several leading edge companies.


Mr. Dent is the author of the 1993 book, The Great Boom Ahead (revised in
1995). His second book, Job Shock: Four New Principles Transforming Our Work and
Business, was published in 1995 and then re-released in 1996 as The Great Jobs
Ahead. The Roaring 2000s updates key principles of these books, and focuses on
the Internet's rapid move into the mainstream and how our work, organizations,
and living circumstances may change. Mr. Dent also publishes the H.S. Dent
Forecast newsletter. Since 1988 he has been speaking to executives around the
world. He has appeared on "Good Morning America", PBS, CNBC, "The Business
Channel", and has been featured in Fortune, Success, The Wall Street Journal,
and Omni.


The Sponsor selected the portfolio based on concepts presented in The Roaring
2000s and research compiled by Mr. Dent. Mr. Dent did not select the stocks for
the portfolio, does not endorse the Trust and will not supervise the portfolio.
The opinions and forecasts of Mr. Dent expressed in his books and elsewhere are
not necessarily those of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and may not actually come to
pass. Mr. Dent is being compensated by the Sponsor for his research. The Roaring
2000sSM is the exclusive property of The H.S. Dent Foundation. The Roaring
2000sSM is a service mark of the H.S. Dent Foundation. The Trust has licensed
the use of this service mark from the H.S. Dent Foundation.


Harry S. Dent, Jr. has not participated in any way in the creation of the
Trust or in the selection of stocks included in the Trust and has not approved
any information herein relating thereto.


Investors should note that the above criteria were applied to the Securities
for inclusion in the Trust as of the Initial Date of Deposit. Subsequent to this
date, the Securities may no longer meet the above criteria. Should a Security no
longer meet the selection criteria, the Security will not as a result thereof be
removed from the Trust portfolio.






RISK FACTORS





PRICE VOLATILITY. The Trust invests in stocks. The value of Units will
fluctuate with the value of these stocks and may be more or less than the price
you originally paid for your Units. The market value of stocks sometimes moves
up or down rapidly and unpredictably. Because the Trust is unmanaged, the
Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in
managed investments. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the
performance of the Trust will be positive over any period of time.


DIVIDENDS. Stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not
obligations of the issuers. Common stockholders have a right to receive
dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors,
bondholders and preferred stockholders. Common stocks do not assure dividend
payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of
directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.


FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. The Trust invests significantly in financial
institutions. Any negative impact on this industry may have a greater impact on
the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries. You
should understand the risks of this industry before you invest.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans; and
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks
and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and
state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.


Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the recently enacted Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial
services overhaul legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial
products. Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional
lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer
data. Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage
firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish
services that were traditionally offered by banks.


Companies engaged in the investment management and broker-dealer activities
are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds
the volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these
companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition
with new and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional
businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology
could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment
management and brokerage industries. Companies involved in investment management
and broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by
government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws,
regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and
rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property and casualty and business insurance.
Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other disasters and the
effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated, insurance companies'
profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law
changes.


TECHNOLOGY ISSUERS. The Trust is concentrated in issuers within the
technology industry. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry may present
more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several industries. The
Trust, and therefore Unitholders, may be particularly susceptible to a negative
impact resulting from adverse market conditions or other factors affecting
technology issuers because any negative impact on the technology industry will
not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated industries. Accordingly,
an investment in Units should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of the technology industry and the risks which such an
investment may entail.


Technology companies generally include companies involved in the development,
design, manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic
products, and other related products, systems and services. The market for
technology products and services, especially those specifically related to the
Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, rapid product
obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent
new product introductions. The success of the issuers of the Securities depends
in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products.
An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's
products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could
have a material adverse affect on an issuer's operating results. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that the issuers of the Securities will be able to
respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.


The market for certain technology products and services may have only
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important
to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that upon redemption of Units or
termination of the Trust a Unitholder will receive an amount greater than or
equal to the Unitholder's initial investment.


Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely
affect the market price of the Securities and therefore the ability of a
Unitholder to redeem units, or roll over Units into a new trust, at a price
equal to or greater than the original price paid for such Units.


Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from single sources. There can be no assurance that in the future
suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost
effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
and interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or
reduction of sales. Because many products and technologies are incorporated into
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
form other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a
relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such
products, technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse
impact on issuers of the Securities.


HEALTH CARE ISSUERS. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry
in general. Healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field. These companies are subject to governmental regulation of
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or
services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological
advances will render their products obsolete. The research and development costs
of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for
several years. Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic. In addition, healthcare facility operators may be affected by events
and conditions including, among other things, demand for services, the ability
of the facility to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the
facility, management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by
insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing
state rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and
possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or
restriction of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with
Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.


Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The Sponsor is
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the
issuers of Securities in your Trust.


NO FDIC GUARANTEE. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.



PUBLIC OFFERING





GENERAL. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
underlying value of the Securities, the sales charge and cash, if any, in the
Income and Capital Accounts. The "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in
Part One describes the sales charge in detail.


Any sales charge reduction is the responsibility of the selling broker,
dealer or agent.


A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in
this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of
the deferred sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the
section called "Wrap Fee and Advisory Accounts" for additional information on
these purchases. Units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at
the Public Offering Price less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to
brokers and dealers for purchases by (1) investors who purchase Units through
registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered
broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage
services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management service,
or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment
account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed, (2) bank trust
departments investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary
investment authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or
similar capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been an officer,
director or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale to investors
or their immediate family members (as described above) and (4) officers and
directors of bank holding companies that make Units available directly or
through subsidiaries or bank affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Prospectus, such investors, bank trust departments, firm
employees and bank holding company officers and directors who purchase Units
through this program will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity
purchases.


Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses, children,
grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law,
sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the
benefit of such persons) of the Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates,
dealers and their affiliates and vendors providing services to the Sponsor may
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer
concession.


The minimum purchase is 100 Units (25 Units for retirement accounts) but may
vary by selling firm. However, in connection with fully disclosed transactions
with the Sponsor, the minimum purchase requirement will be that number of Units
set forth in the contract between the Sponsor and the related broker or agent.


OFFERING PRICE. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One in
accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in the
Trust. The Evaluator or Trustee, as applicable, will generally determine the
value of the Securities as of the Evaluation Time on each business day and will
adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. This Public Offering
Price will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on
each business day. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on each Trust business day. Orders received by the Trustee or Sponsor
for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day which is not a
business day, will be held until the next determination of price. The term
"business day", as used herein and under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and holidays observed by the New York Stock
Exchange. The term "business day" also excludes any day on which more than 33%
of the Securities are not traded on their principal trading exchange due to a
customary business holiday on that exchange.


The aggregate underlying value of the Securities during the initial offering
period is determined on each business day by the Evaluator or Trustee, as
applicable, in the following manner: If the Securities are listed on a national
or foreign securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., this evaluation
is generally based on the closing sale prices on that exchange or market (unless
it is determined that these prices are inappropriate as a basis for valuation)
or, if there is no closing sale price on that exchange or market, at the closing
asked prices. If the Securities are not listed on a national or foreign
securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or, if so listed and the
principal market therefor is other than on the exchange or market, the
evaluation shall generally be based on the current asked price on the
over-the-counter market (unless it is determined that these prices are
inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If current asked prices are
unavailable, the evaluation is generally determined (a) on the basis of current
asked prices for comparable securities, (b) by appraising the value of the
Securities on the asked side of the market or (c) by any combination of the
above. The value of any foreign securities is based on the applicable currency
exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The value of the Securities for
purposes of secondary market transactions and redemptions is described under
"Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units".


In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor any
broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather the
entire pool of Securities in the Trust, taken as a whole, which are represented
by the Units.


UNIT DISTRIBUTION. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price. Units repurchased in the
secondary market, if any, may be offered by this Prospectus at the secondary
market Public Offering Price in the manner described above.


The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Brokers,
dealers and others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in
connection with the distribution of Units equal to 70% of the sales charge
applicable to the transaction. Any discount provided to investors will be borne
by the selling dealer or agent as indicated under "General" above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of
any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or
paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any
individual transaction exceed the total sales charge applicable to such
transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any
order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or
agency commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales
charge. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions are also applied on a
Unit basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $10 per Unit and will be applied
on whichever basis is more favorable to the broker, dealer or agent.


Broker-dealers of the Trust, banks and/or others may be eligible to
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under
which the sales forces of brokers, dealers, banks and/or others may be eligible
to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts, or under which the
Sponsor will reallow to such brokers, dealers, banks and/or others that sponsor
sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the
Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount
not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such
persons at the public offering price during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in
its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established
by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying entities for certain services or
activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units of the
Trust. Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out
of the assets of the Trust. These programs will not change the price Unitholders
pay for their Units or the amount that the Trust will receive from the Units
sold.


SPONSOR AND OTHER COMPENSATION. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales
commission equal to the total sales charge applicable to each transaction. Any
sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer
or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or loss as a result of
the difference between the price paid for the Securities by the Sponsor and the
cost of the Securities to the Trust on the Initial Date of Deposit as well as on
subsequent deposits. The Sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as
manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates or as an agent in a
private placement for any of the Securities. The Sponsor may realize profit or
loss as a result of the possible fluctuations in the market value of the
Securities, since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units are retained by
the Sponsor. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the date of
settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's business and
may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the limitations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


The Sponsor or an affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one
or more of the Securities. The Sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have
a long or short position in these Securities or related securities. An affiliate
may act as a specialist or market maker for these Securities. An officer,
director or employee of the Sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or
director for issuers of the Securities.


Purchases and sales of Securities by your Trust may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of
Units, upon Trust termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit
redemptions. Any publication of a list of Securities, or a list of anticipated
Securities, to be included in a Trust may also cause increased buying activity
in certain Securities. Once this information becomes public, investors may
purchase individual Securities appearing in such a publication and may do so
during or prior to the initial offering of Units. It is possible that these
investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the Sponsor
or its affiliates or firms that are distributing Units. This activity may cause
your Trust to purchase stocks at a higher price than those buyers who effect
purchases prior to purchases by your Trust.


MARKET FOR UNITS. The Sponsor does not currently intend to maintain a market
for Units or to purchase Units at any secondary market repurchase price. A
Unitholder may, however, dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for
redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to determine the best price for
Units in the secondary market. The Trustee will notify the Sponsor of any Units
tendered for redemption. The Sponsor may purchase the Units not later than the
day on which Units would have been redeemed by the Trustee. If the Sponsor
decides to maintain a secondary market, the Sponsor may sell repurchased Units
at the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.



RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS





Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit
sharing plans for employees. The minimum purchase for these accounts is reduced
to 25 Units but may vary by selling firm. The purchase of Units may be limited
by the plans' provisions and does not itself establish such plans.



WRAP FEE AND ADVISORY ACCOUNTS





Units may be available for purchase by investors who purchase Units through
registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered
broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage
services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management service,
or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment
account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed. You should
consult your financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from
these accounts. For these purchases you generally only pay the portion of the
sales charge that is retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc.


You should consult the "Public Offering--General" section for specific
information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section governs the
calculation of all sales charge discounts.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





DISTRIBUTIONS. Dividends and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities
received by the Trust will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. These
dates appear under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. A
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three
business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units.
Distributions may also be reinvested into Van Kampen mutual funds. See "Rights
of Unitholders--Reinvestment Option".


Dividends received by the Trust are credited to the Income Account of the
Trust. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or
pay fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received from
the disposition of any Securities after a record date and prior to the following
distribution date will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until
the next distribution date. Any distribution to Unitholders consists of each
Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income and Capital
Accounts as of the related Record Date.


REINVESTMENT OPTION. Unitholders may have distributions automatically
reinvested in additional Units under the Automatic Reinvestment Option (to the
extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the
Unitholder resides). Brokers and dealers can use the Dividend Reinvestment
Service through Depository Trust Company. To participate in this reinvestment
option, a Unitholder must file with the Trustee a written notice of election,
together with any certificate representing Units and other documentation that
the Trustee may then require, at least five days prior to the related Record
Date. A Unitholder's election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder
and will remain in effect until changed by the Unitholder. If Units are
unavailable for reinvestment, distributions will be paid in cash. Purchases of
additional Units made pursuant to the reinvestment plan will be made at the net
asset value for Units as of the Evaluation Time on the Distribution Date.


In addition, under the Guaranteed Reinvestment Option Unitholders may elect
to have distributions automatically reinvested in certain Van Kampen mutual
funds (the "Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment
objectives which differ from those of the Trust. The prospectus relating to each
Reinvestment Fund describes its investment policies and how to begin
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds
from the Sponsor. Purchases of shares of a Reinvestment Fund will be made at a
net asset value computed on the Distribution Date. Unitholders with an existing
Guaranteed Reinvestment Option account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on
distribution reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new
account which allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value.


A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than
five days before a distribution date. The Sponsor, each Reinvestment Fund, and
its investment adviser shall have the right to suspend or terminate these
reinvestment plans at any time.


REDEMPTION OF UNITS. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay Street,
20th Floor, New York, New York 10286. Certificates must be tendered to the
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable
governmental charges, if any. On the seventh day following the tender, the
Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to
the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender. The "date of
tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the Trustee,
except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the Evaluation
Time or on a day which is not a Trust business day, the date of tender is deemed
to be the next business day.


Unitholders tendering 1,000 or more Units of the Trust (or such higher amount
as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent) for redemption may
request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the Redemption Price per
Unit on the date of tender. The Trust generally does not offer in kind
distributions of portfolio securities that are held in foreign markets.
Unitholders may not request an in kind distribution during the five business
days preceding the Trust's termination. An in kind distribution will be made by
the Trustee through the distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry
form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust
Company. Amounts representing fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The
Trustee may adjust the number of shares of any Security included in a
Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole
shares.


The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in kind or sold, the size of the Trust will be, and
the diversity of the Trust may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when
Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less
than the amount paid by the Unitholder depending on the value of the Securities
at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result
if a Unitholder requests an in kind distribution. See "Taxation".


The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust determined on the
basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust, (ii) the value of the Securities in
the Trust and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in the Trust trading
ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a) amounts representing taxes
or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. During the initial offering period, the redemption price
and the secondary market repurchase price will include estimated organizational
and offering costs. For these purposes, the Evaluator or Trustee, as applicable,
may determine the value of the Securities in the following manner: If the
Securities are listed on a national or foreign securities exchange or the Nasdaq
Stock Market, Inc., this evaluation is generally based on the closing sale
prices on that exchange or market (unless it is determined that these prices are
inappropriate as a basis for valuation) or, if there is no closing sale price on
that exchange or market, at the closing bid prices. If the Securities are not so
listed or, if so listed and the principal market therefor is other than on the
exchange or market, the evaluation may be based on the current bid price on the
over-the-counter market. If current bid prices are unavailable or inappropriate,
the evaluation may be determined (a) on the basis of current bid prices for
comparable securities, (b) by appraising the Securities on the bid side of the
market or (c) by any combination of the above. The value of any foreign
securities is based on the applicable currency exchange rate as of the
Evaluation Time.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.


CERTIFICATES. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the
certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written
request, and certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on
the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the signature
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program
("STAMP") or a signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain
instances the Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates
will not be issued. The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed,
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for
replacement.


REPORTS PROVIDED. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by the Trust for each distribution. Within a reasonable time
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual Trust
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the Securities and other Trust
information. Unitholders may obtain the evaluations of the Securities upon
request.



TRUST ADMINISTRATION





PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION. The Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold or
replaced. The Sponsor may, however, direct that Securities be sold in certain
limited circumstances to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor.
These situations may include events such as the issuer having defaulted on
payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a Security has
declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so that in the opinion
of the Sponsor retention of the Security would be detrimental to the Trust. If a
public tender offer has been made for a Security or a merger or acquisition has
been announced affecting a Security, the Trustee may either sell the Security or
accept a tender offer for cash if the Supervisor determines that the sale or
tender is in the best interest of Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute any
cash proceeds to Unitholders. In addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to
redeem Units or pay Trust expenses. The Trustee must reject any offer for
securities or property other than cash in exchange for the Securities. If
securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the Trust, the Sponsor may
direct the Trustee to sell the securities or property and distribute the
proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities or property for deposit in
the Trust. Should any contract for the purchase of any of the Securities fail,
the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the moneys held in the Trust to
cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute Securities in accordance with
the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales charge attributable to the failed
contract to all Unitholders on or before the next distribution date.


When your Trust sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the
Securities in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for
the Trust, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum amounts
(generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In
effecting purchases and sales of the Trust's portfolio securities, the Sponsor
may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to
brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated with the Trust, the Sponsor
or dealers participating in the offering of Units. In addition, in selecting
among firms to handle a particular transaction, the Sponsor may take into
account whether the firm has sold or is selling units of unit investment trusts
which it sponsors.


AMENDMENT OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely
affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee).
The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or permit
acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the Securities
(except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.


TERMINATION. The Trust will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date or
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust. The
Trust may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing
two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the
Trust is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has exceeded
$15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value"). Unitholders will be notified of
any termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a
Trust termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory
Termination Date. Approximately thirty days before this date, the Trustee will
notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling qualified
Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". This form must be returned at least five
business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. Unitholders will receive
a final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the Mandatory
Termination Date. All distributions will be net of Trust expenses and costs.
Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following termination.
The Information Supplement contains further information regarding termination of
the Trusts. See "Additional Information".


LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES. The Sponsor, Evaluator, Supervisor and Trustee
are under no liability for taking any action or for refraining from taking any
action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement, or for errors in judgment,
but shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence (negligence in the case of the Trustee) in the performance of their
duties or by reason of their reckless disregard of their obligations and duties
hereunder. The Trustee is not liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason
of the sale by the Trustee of any of the Securities. In the event of the failure
of the Sponsor to act under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder
and is not liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust
Agreement. The Trustee is not liable for any taxes or other governmental charges
imposed on the Securities, on it as Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a
Trust which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law
of the United States of America or of any other taxing authority having
jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust Agreement contains other customary
provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee. The Trustee, Sponsor and
Supervisor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Evaluator or Trustee, as
applicable, and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations
by the Evaluator or Trustee, as applicable, shall be made in good faith upon the
basis of the best information available to it.


SPONSOR. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The Sponsor is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The Sponsor has its
principal offices at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181-5555. As
of November 30, 2000, the total stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc.
was $161,761,917 (audited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a
code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information
on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of
the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,
deception or misconduct with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement
contains additional information about the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.


TRUSTEE. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust
division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286 (800) 221-7668.
The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by the
Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information
regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the
Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a
merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the
Trustee. See "Additional Information".


PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising
and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and
returns over specified time periods on other similar Van Kampen trusts or
investment strategies utilized by the Trust (which may show performance net of
expenses and charges which the Trust would have charged) with returns on other
taxable investments such as the common stocks comprising the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, the S&P 500, other investment indices, corporate or U.S.
government bonds, bank CDs, money market accounts or money market funds, or with
performance data from Lipper Analytical Services, Inc., Morningstar
Publications, Inc. or various publications, each of which has characteristics
that may differ from those of the Trust. Information on percentage changes in
the dollar value of Units may be included from time to time in advertisements,
sales literature, reports and other information furnished to current or
prospective Unitholders. Total return figures may not be averaged and may not
reflect deduction of the sales charge, which would decrease return. No provision
is made for any income taxes payable. Past performance may not be indicative of
future results. The Trust portfolio is not managed and Unit price and return
fluctuate with the value of common stocks in the portfolio, so there may be a
gain or loss when Units are sold. As with other performance data, performance
comparisons should not be considered representative of the Trust's relative
performance for any future period.


STYLE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION. A balanced investment portfolio incorporates
various style and market capitalization characteristics. We offer unit trusts
with a variety of styles and capitalizations to meet your needs. A Trust is not
a balanced investment portfolio itself and should not be your only investment.
From time to time in advertising and sales materials we may utilize investment
style and market capitalization categories to assist in determining the
investment category that a Trust might fill within an investor's overall
investment portfolio. Investors should note that investment style and market
capitalization are not used in selecting the stocks for a Trust.


We determine the style characteristics (growth or value) based on the types
of stocks in a Trust. Generally, a growth portfolio includes companies in a
growth phase of their business with increasing earnings. A value portfolio
generally includes companies with low relative price-earnings ratios that we
believe are undervalued. We generally determine the market capitalization based
on the weighted median market capitalization of a Trust. Investment style and
capitalization characteristics will vary over time. We will not remove a
Security from a Trust as a result of any change in characteristics.



TAXATION





The following is a general discussion of certain of the federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Units of the
Trust. The summary is limited to investors who hold the Units as "capital
assets" (generally, property held for investment within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code")). Unitholders should
consult their tax advisers in determining the federal, state, local and any
other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units in
the Trust. For purposes of the following discussion and opinion, it is assumed
that each Security in the Trust is equity for federal income tax purposes.


In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, special counsel for the Sponsor, under
existing law:


1. Your Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes; each Unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of each of the assets of the Trust under the Code; and the income of the
Trust will be treated as income of the Unitholders thereof under the Code. Each
Unitholder will be considered to have received his pro rata share of income
derived from each Security when such income is considered to be received by the
Trust.


2. Each Unitholder will have a taxable event when the Trust disposes of a
Security (whether by sale, exchange, liquidation, redemption, or otherwise) or
upon the sale or redemption of Units by such Unitholder (except to the extent an
in kind distribution of stock is received by such Unitholder as described
below). The price a Unitholder pays for his Units, generally including sales
charges, is allocated among his pro rata portion of each Security held by the
Trust (in proportion to the fair market values thereof on the valuation date
nearest the date the Unitholder purchase his Units) in order to determine his
initial tax basis for his pro rata portion of each Security held by the Trust.
Unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to calculation of
basis. For federal income tax purposes, a Unitholder's pro rata portion of
dividends as defined by Section 316 of the Code paid by a corporation with
respect to a Security held by the Trust are taxable as ordinary income to the
extent of such corporation's current and accumulated "earnings and profits". A
Unitholder's pro rata portion of dividends paid on such Security which exceeds
such current and accumulated earnings and profits will first reduce a
Unitholder's tax basis in such Security, and to the extent that such dividends
exceed a Unitholder's tax basis in such Security shall generally be treated as
capital gain. In general, the holding period for such capital gain will be
determined by the period of time a Unitholder has held his Units.


3. A Unitholder's portion of gain, if any, upon the sale or redemption of
Units or the disposition of Securities held by the Trust will generally be
considered a capital gain, except in the case of a dealer or a financial
institution. A Unitholder's portion of loss, if any, upon the sale or redemption
of Units or the disposition of Securities held by the Trust will generally be
considered a capital loss (except in the case of a dealer or a financial
institution). Unitholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the
recognition of such capital gains and losses for federal income tax purposes.


DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION. A Unitholder will be considered to have
received all of the dividends paid on his pro rata portion of each Security when
such dividends are received by the Trust. Unitholders will be taxed in this
manner regardless of whether distributions from the Trust are actually received
by the Unitholder or are automatically reinvested. A corporation that owns Units
will generally be entitled to a 70% dividends received deduction with respect to
such Unitholder's pro rata portion of dividends received by the Trust (to the
extent such dividends are taxable as ordinary income, as discussed above, and
are attributable to domestic corporations) in the same manner as if such
corporation directly owned the Securities paying such dividends (other than
corporate Unitholders, such as "S" corporations, which are not eligible for the
deduction because of their special characteristics and other than for purposes
of special taxes such as the accumulated earnings tax and the personal holding
corporation tax). However, a corporation owning Units should be aware that
Sections 246 and 246A of the Code impose additional limitations on the
eligibility of dividends for the 70% dividends received deduction. These
limitations include a requirement that stock (and therefore Units) must
generally be held at least 46 days (as determined under Section 246(c) of the
Code). Final regulations have been issued which address special rules that must
be considered in determining whether the 46 day holding requirement is met.
Moreover, the allowable percentage of the deduction will be reduced from 70% if
a corporate Unitholder owns certain stock (or Units) the financing of which is
directly attributable to indebtedness incurred by such corporation.


To the extent dividends received by the Trust are attributable to foreign
corporations, a corporation that owns Units will not be entitled to the
dividends received deduction with respect to its pro rata portion of such
dividends, since the dividends received deduction is generally available only
with respect to dividends paid by domestic corporations. Unitholders should
consult with their tax advisers with respect to the limitations on and possible
modifications to the dividends received deduction.


LIMITATIONS ON DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES BY UNITHOLDERS. Each
Unitholder's pro rata share of each expense paid by the Trust is deductible by
the Unitholder to the same extent as though the expense had been paid directly
by him. As a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, certain miscellaneous
itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, tax return preparation fees
and employee business expenses will be deductible by an individual only to the
extent they exceed 2% of such individual's adjusted gross income. Unitholders
may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust as
miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to this limitation. Unitholders should
consult with their own tax advisers regarding the deductibility of Trust
expenses.


RECOGNITION OF TAXABLE GAIN OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION OF SECURITIES BY THE
TRUST OR DISPOSITION OF UNITS. As discussed above, a Unitholder may recognize
taxable gain (or loss) when a Security is disposed of by the Trust or if the
Unitholder disposes of a Unit. The Internal Revenue Service Restructing and
Reform Act of 1998 (the "1998 Tax Act") provides that for taxpayers other than
corporations, net capital gain (which is defined as net long-term capital gain
over net short-term capital loss for the taxable year) realized from property
(with certain exclusions) is subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate of
20% (10% in the case of certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket). Capital
gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the asset is more than one
year, and is short-term if the holding period for the asset is one year or less.
The date on which a Unit is acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for
purposes of determining the holding period of the Unit. Capital gains realized
from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same rates as ordinary
income.


For tax years beginning after December 31, 2000, the 20% rate is reduced to
18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term gains from most property the
holding period of which is more than five years. Due to the length of the
Trust's life, the reduction in the capital gains rate for property held for more
than five years could only possibly apply to your interest in the Securities if
you are eligible for and elect to receive an in kind distribution at redemption
or termination.


In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered into
after April 30, 1993. Unitholders and prospective investors should consult with
their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this provision on their
investment in Units.


If a Unitholder disposes of a Unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of
his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the Trust including his pro rata
portion of all Securities represented by a Unit.


The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the "1997 Tax Act") includes provisions that
treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and
opportunities for gain (e.g., short sales, offsetting notional principal
contracts, futures or forward contracts or similar transactions) as constructive
sales for purposes of recognition of gain (but not of loss) and for purposes of
determining the holding period. Unitholders should consult their own tax
advisers with regard to any such constructive sales rules.





SPECIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF IN KIND DISTRIBUTIONS UPON REDEMPTION OF UNITS OR
TERMINATION OF THE TRUST. As discussed in "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units", under certain circumstances a Unitholder tendering Units for redemption
may request an in kind distribution. A Unitholder may also under certain
circumstances request an in kind distribution upon the termination of the Trust.
See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units. As previously discussed, prior
to the redemption of Units or the termination of the Trust, a Unitholder is
considered as owning a pro rata portion of each of the Trust's assets for
federal income tax purposes. The receipt of an in kind distribution will result
in a Unitholder receiving whole shares of stock plus, possibly, cash.


The potential tax consequences that may occur under an in kind distribution
with respect to each Security held by the Trust will depend on whether or not a
Unitholder receives cash in addition to Securities. A "Security" for this
purpose is a particular class of stock issued by a particular corporation. A
Unitholder will not recognize gain or loss if a Unitholder only receives
Securities in exchange for his or her pro rata portion in the Securities held by
the Trust . However, if a Unitholder also receives cash in exchange for a
fractional share of such Security held by the Trust, such Unitholder will
generally recognize gain or loss based upon the difference between the amount of
cash received by the Unitholder and his tax basis in such fractional share of a
Security held by the Trust.


Because the Trust will own many Securities, a Unitholder who requests an in
kind distribution will have to analyze the tax consequences with respect to each
Security owned by the Trust. The amount of taxable gain (or loss) recognized
upon such exchange will generally equal the sum of the gain (or loss) recognized
under the rules described above by such Unitholder with respect to each Security
owned by the Trust. Unitholders who request an in kind distribution are advised
to consult their tax advisers in this regard.


COMPUTATION OF THE UNITHOLDER'S TAX BASIS. Initially, a Unitholder's tax
basis in his Units will generally equal the price paid by such Unitholder of his
Units. The cost of the Units is allocated among the Securities held in the Trust
in accordance with the proportion of the fair market values of such Securities
on the valuation date nearest the date the Units are purchased in order to
determine such Unitholder's tax basis for his pro rata portion of each Security.


A Unitholder's tax basis in his Units and his pro rata portion of a Security
held by the Trust will be reduced to the extent dividends paid with respect to
such Security are received by the Trust which are not taxable as ordinary income
as described above.


OTHER MATTERS. Each Unitholder will be requested to provide the Unitholder's
taxpayer identification number to the Trustee and to certify that the Unitholder
has not been notified that payments to the Unitholder are subject to back-up
withholding. If the proper taxpayer identification number and appropriate
certification are not provided when requested, distributions by the Trust to
such Unitholder (including amounts received upon the redemption of Units) will
be subject to back-up withholding. Distributions by the Trust (other than those
that are not treated as United States source income, if any) will generally be
subject to United States income taxation and withholding in the case of Units
held by non-resident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other non-United
States persons. Such persons should consult their tax advisers.


In general, income that is not effectively connected to the conduct of a
trade or business within the United States that is earned by non-U.S.
Unitholders and derived from dividends of foreign corporations will not be
subject to U.S. withholding tax provided that less than 25 percent of the gross
income of the foreign corporations for a three-year period ending with the close
of its taxable year preceding payment was effectively connected to the conduct
of a trade or business within the United States. In addition, such earnings may
be exempt from U.S. withholding pursuant to a specific treaty between the United
States and a foreign country. Non-U.S. Unitholders should consult their own tax
advisers regarding the imposition of U.S. withholding on distributions from the
Trust.


It should be noted that payments to the Trust of dividends on Securities that
are attributable to foreign corporations may be subject to foreign withholding
taxes and Unitholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential
tax consequences relating to the payment of any such withholding taxes by the
Trust. Any dividends withheld as a result thereof will nevertheless be treated
as income to the Unitholders. Because, under the grantor trust rules, an
investor is deemed to have paid directly his share of foreign taxes that have
been paid or accrued, if any, an investor may be entitled to a foreign tax
credit or deduction for United States tax purposes with respect to such taxes.
The 1997 Tax Act imposes a required holding period for such credits. Investors
should consult their tax advisers with respect to foreign withholding taxes and
foreign tax credits.


At the termination of the Trust, the Trustee will furnish to each Unitholder
of the Trust a statement containing information relating to the dividends
received by the Trust on the Securities, the gross proceeds received by the
Trust from the disposition of any Security (resulting from redemption or the
sale of any Security), and the fees and expenses paid by the Trust. The Trustee
will also furnish annual information returns to Unitholders and to the Internal
Revenue Service.


In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for New York tax matters, the
Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and the income of the Trust
will be treated as the income of the Unitholders under the existing income tax
laws of the State and City of New York.


The foregoing discussion relates only to the tax treatment of U.S.
Unitholders ("U.S. Unitholders") with regard to federal and certain aspects of
New York State and City income taxes. Unitholders may be subject to taxation in
New York or in other jurisdictions and should consult their own tax advisers in
this regard. As used herein, the term "U.S. Unitholder" means an owner of a Unit
of the Trust that (a) is (i) for United States federal income tax purposes a
citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or
other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or
of any political subdivision thereof, or (iii) an estate or trust the income of
which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source or (b) does not qualify as a U.S. Unitholder in paragraph (a) but whose
income from a Unit is effectively connected with such Unitholder's conduct of a
United States trade or business. The term also includes certain former citizens
of the United States whose income and gain on the Units will be taxable.
Unitholders should consult their tax advisers regarding potential foreign, state
or local taxation with respect to the Units.



TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES





GENERAL. The fees and expenses of your portfolio will accrue on a daily
basis. The fees and expenses are generally paid out of the Capital Account of
your Trust. It is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts
which will result in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation". The
Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be increased without
approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases
under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price
Index or, if this category is not published, in a comparable category.


ORGANIZATION COSTS. You and the other Unitholders may bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the
establishment of your Trust. These costs and charges will include the cost of
the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration
statement and other documents relating to your Trust, federal and state
registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and
legal and auditing expenses. The public offering price of Units includes the
estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from
your Trust's assets at the end of the initial offering period.


TRUSTEE'S FEE. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from your
Portfolio set forth in the "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part
One. The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and
Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and
the amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the
Trustee's compensation for its services to your Trust is expected to result from
the use of these funds.


COMPENSATION OF SPONSOR, THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR. The Sponsor and the
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee
for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory
services set forth in the "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part
One. The Evaluator, if any, will receive the annual fee for providing evaluation
services set forth in the "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part
One. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to your
Trust but at no time will the total amount received for these services rendered
to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the
aggregate cost of providing these services in that year.


MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by your Trust: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Trust,

(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the
Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any action
taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of
Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or
expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust without negligence, bad
faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction
fees, (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the Trust,

(i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and

(j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the
Trust. Each Trust may pay the expenses of updating its registration statement
each year.

RISK FACTORS



PRICE VOLATILITY. Because your Trust invests in common stocks of U.S. and
foreign companies, you should understand the risks of investing in common stocks
before purchasing Units. These risks include the risk that the financial
condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen
and the value of the stocks (and therefore Units) will fall. Common stocks are
especially susceptible to general stock market movements. The value of common
stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and
perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on factors
including expectations regarding government economic policies, inflation,
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates and
economic or banking crises. The value of Units will fluctuate with the value of
the stocks in your Trust and may be more or less than the price you originally
paid for your Units. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the
performance of your Trust will be positive over any period of time. Because the
Trust is unmanaged, the Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market
fluctuations as is common in managed investments. In addition, because your
Trust holds a relatively small number of stocks, you may encounter greater
market risk than in a more diversified investment.


DIVIDENDS. Common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are
not obligations of the company. Accordingly, common stockholders have a right to
receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of
creditors, bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that
common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board
of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.


FOREIGN STOCKS. Because your Trust invests in foreign common stocks, they
involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks.
Investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than
those in domestic securities. There is generally less publicly available
information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar
to those that are published about issuers in the United States. Also, foreign
issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial
reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to United States issuers.
With respect to certain foreign countries, there is the possibility of adverse
changes in investment or exchange control regulations, expropriation,
nationalization or confiscatory taxation, limitations on the removal of funds or
other assets of your Trust, political or social instability, or diplomatic
developments which could affect United States investments in those countries.
Moreover, industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from
the United States' economy in terms of growth of gross national product, rate of
inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of
payments position. Foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or
efficient as those in the United States. While growing in volume, they usually
have substantially less volume than the New York Stock Exchange, and securities
of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of
comparable United States issuers. Fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are
generally higher than negotiated commissions on United States exchanges. There
is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges,
brokers and listed issuers than in the United States.


FOREIGN CURRENCIES. Your Trust also involves the risk that fluctuations in
exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively
affect the value of the stocks. For example, if a foreign stock rose 10% in
price but the U.S. dollar gained 5% against the related foreign currency, a U.S.
investor's return would be reduced to about 5%. This is because the foreign
currency would "buy" fewer dollars or, conversely, a dollar would buy more of
the foreign currency. Many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely against the
U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency,
investor perceptions of world or country economies, political instability,
currency speculation by institutional investors, changes in government policies,
buying and selling of currencies by central banks of countries, trade balances
and changes in interest rates. Your Trust's foreign currency transactions will
be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as principals on a spot (i.e.,
cash) buying basis. These dealers realize a profit based on the difference
between the price at which they buy the currency (bid price) and the price at
which they sell the currency (offer price). The Trustee will estimate the
currency exchange rates based on current activity in the related currency
exchange markets, however, due to the volatility of the markets and other
factors, the estimated rates may not be indicative of the rate your Trust might
obtain had the Trustee sold the currency in the market at that time.


FINANCIAL SERVICES ISSUERS. An investment in Units of the Trust should be
made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank and
financial services sector in general.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly
dependent on net interest margin. Recently, bank profits have come under
pressure as net interest margins have contracted, but volume gains have been
strong in both commercial and consumer products. There is no certainty that such
conditions will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee
income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial
home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing
interest rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in
the real estate markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a
substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their
assets invested in loans secured by real estate. Banks and their holding
companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and, when such
institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation as well. Such regulations
impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of
business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a
wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement
authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a
particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of
such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory
actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to
banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks
and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can
negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends.
Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations, however,
insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies, or
insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such
institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized
and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the
Securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The
recently enacted Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial-services overhaul legislation will
allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to
liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law. Under the
legislation, banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any
state, one year after the legislation's enactment. Since mid-1997, banks have
been allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation is likely to
continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and
have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in
trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may
result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and
mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional
legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank
regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community
Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be
no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the
Securities in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit
insurance system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed
reforms of that system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in
which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or
number of deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce
profitability, as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become
more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank
deposits. Banks face significant competition from other financial institutions
such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance
companies, and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of
regional and national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such
legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously
prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into
one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or
what ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.


Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these
companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition
with new and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional
businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology
could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment
management and brokerage industries. Companies involved in the investment
management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could
adversely affect the stock prices of such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may be exposed
to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from
reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental
regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be
adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may
also adversley affect insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and
profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies
continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new
competitors, capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete
globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;


o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be
expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;


o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;


o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;


o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and


o    the uncertainty involved in estmating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state leglislatures have considered or
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such
legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


TECHNOLOGY ISSUERS. Your Trust invests significantly in issuers within the
technology industry. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry may present
more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several industries. The
Trust, and therefore Unitholders, may be particularly susceptible to a negative
impact resulting from adverse market conditions or other factors affecting
technology issuers because any negative impact on the technology industry will
not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated industries. Accordingly,
an investment in Units should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of the technology industry and the risks which such an
investment may entail.


Technology companies generally include companies involved in the development,
design, manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic
products, and other related products, systems and services. The market for
technology products and services, especially those specifically related to the
Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, rapid product
obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent
new product introductions. The success of the issuers of the Securities depends
in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products.
An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's
products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could
have a material adverse affect on an issuer's operating results. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that the issuers of the Securities will be able to
respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.


The market for certain technology products and services may have only
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important
to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that upon redemption of Units or
termination of your Trust a Unitholder will receive an amount greater than or
equal to the Unitholder's initial investment.


Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely
affect the market price of the Securities and therefore the ability of a
Unitholder to redeem units, or roll over Units into a new trust, at a price
equal to or greater than the original price paid for such Units.


Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from single sources. There can be no assurance that in the future
suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost
effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
and interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or
reduction of sales. Because many products and technologies are incorporated into
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
form other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a
relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such
products, technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse
impact on issuers of the Securities.


HEALTH CARE ISSUERS. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry
in general. Healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field. These companies are subject to governmental regulation of
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or
services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological
advances will render their products obsolete. The research and development costs
of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for
several years. Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic. In addition, healthcare facility operators may be affected by events
and conditions including, among other things, demand for services, the ability
of the facility to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the
facility, management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by
insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing
state rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and
possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or
restriction of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with
Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.


Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The Sponsor is
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the
issuers of Securities in your Trust.


LIQUIDITY. Whether or not the stocks in the Trust are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid.
The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent.


ADDITIONAL UNITS. The Sponsor may create additional Units of the Trust by
depositing into the Trust additional stocks or cash with instructions to
purchase additional stocks. A cash deposit could result in a dilution of your
investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the
stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and
because the Trust will pay brokerage fees.


VOTING. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Trust. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in your
Trust. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The Trustee
will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other
shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.



THE TRUST



Harry S. Dent, Jr. believes that the economy may be on the edge of economic
change that may change how people communicate and fundamentally alter how and
where people live and work. At the same time, Mr. Dent believes the Baby Boom
generation will reach its peak earning, spending and productivity years. Mr.
Dent believes that the convergence of these two events could spark the trends of
the years ahead.


The Trust was designed to benefit from the insights, philosophies and
strategies found in the book, "The Roaring 2000s," by Harry S. Dent, Jr.


Family spending cycles of each new generation of consumers and workers drive
the economy. Birth rates, because they show how many people are in a generation,
may be a leading indicator of the economy. As a generation develops and moves
into its peak family spending cycle, the economy may rise.


To account for the number of people at their peak spending age at a given
time, Mr. Dent lags the birth index forward 46.5 years (the average person
historically hits their peak spending at approximately 46.5 years of age). After
consideration of this lag, the birth index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
adjusted for inflation, have exhibited a close correlation in the past. Mr. Dent
believes that this "Spending Wave" may enable a connection to be made, helping
to forecast the economy in the future. Of course, past performance is no
guarantee of future results.


Based on the cycles discussed previously, Mr. Dent has identified various
sectors of our economy that may be primed for growth potential. The Trust seeks
to capitalize on trends impacting four main sectors, including:


o  TECHNOLOGY - New technologies may be shaping new standards in the way
people work and live. Businesses may be beginning to prepare for
downshifts in the labor force by investing in labor saving technology that
could improve productivity and lower costs.


o  FINANCIAL SERVICES - The Baby Boomers may be forced to become investors
and, therefore, may need to seek financial advice. Additionally, choices
for investing are numerous and complicated. As our economy grows, so may
additional opportunities for investment vehicles.


o  HEALTH CARE - As the Baby Boomers age, health care may become increasingly
important as needs statistically begin to rise. As people age they tend to
spend more of their income on health care costs. As technologies increase,
Americans may find more options and choices in this sector than ever
before.


o  U.S. MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES - A global marketplace is emerging and many
U.S.-based companies appear to be experiencing new sales growth through
the elimination of geographical barriers that once inhibited sales. Now,
through technology increases, multinational companies may be emerging as
market leaders internationally as well as domestically.


The Sponsor selected the portfolio based on concepts presented in The Roaring
2000s and research compiled by Mr. Dent. Mr. Dent did not select the stocks for
the portfolio, does not endorse the Trust and will not supervise the portfolio.
The opinions and forecasts of Mr. Dent expressed in his books and elsewhere are
not necessarily those of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and may not actually come to
pass. Mr. Dent is being compensated by the Sponsor for his research.

SPONSOR INFORMATION



Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Trust. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The principal office
of the Sponsor is located at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555.


Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. is a preeminent global financial services
firm that maintains leading market positions in each of its three primary
businesses: securities, asset management and credit services.


Van Kampen is one of the nation's largest investment management companies,
with more than $81 billion in assets under management or supervision as of March
31, 2001. With roots in money management dating back to 1927, Van Kampen has
helped more than four generations of investors achieve their financial goals. As
of November 30, 2000, the total stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc.
was $161,761,917 (audited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a
code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information
on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of
the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,
deception or misconduct with respect to your Trust. (This paragraph relates only
to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other Series thereof. The
information is included herein only for the purpose of informing investors as to
the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out its
contractual obligations. More detailed financial information will be made
available by the Sponsor upon request.)


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.



TRUSTEE INFORMATION



The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the
laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust division
offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286 (800) 221-7668. The Bank
of New York is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Trust portfolio.


In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trust. Such
records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of the
Trust held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open to
inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual business
hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,
together with a current list of the Securities held in the Trust.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor.
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.


Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.



TRUST TERMINATION



The Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Trust, as shown by any
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has
exceeded $15,000,000). The Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event
that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for
redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced
to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited
in the Trust. If the Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement will terminate
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held thereunder, but in
no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory Termination Date.


Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities will begin to be sold in
connection with the termination of the Trust. The Sponsor will determine the
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct,
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 30 days before
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any
termination to all Unitholders of the Trust and will include with such notice a
form to enable qualified Unitholders to request an in kind distribution of the
U.S.-traded Securities. To be effective, this request must be returned to the
Trustee at least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. On
the Mandatory Termination Date (or on the previous business day if a holiday)
the Trustee will deliver each requesting Unitholder's pro rata number of whole
shares of the U.S.-traded Securities in the Trust to the account of the
broker-dealer or bank designated by the Unitholder at Depository Trust Company.
A Unitholder electing an in kind distribution will not receive a distribution of
shares of the foreign exchange-traded Securities but will instead receive cash
representing his pro rata portion of such Securities. The value of the
Unitholder's fractional shares of the Securities will be paid in cash.
Unitholders who are not qualified to, or who do not, request an in kind
distribution will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining
Securities within a reasonable time following the Mandatory Termination Date.
Regardless of the distribution involved, the Trustee will deduct from the funds
of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses, advances or indemnities provided by
the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of
liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any
applicable taxes or other governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in a
Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be
realized if such sale were not required at such time. The Trustee will then
distribute to the Unitholder of the Trust his pro rata share of the balance of
the Income and Capital Accounts of the Trust.


The Sponsor currently intends to, but is not obligated to, offer for sale
units of a subsequent series of the Trust. There is, however, no assurance that
units of any new series of the Trust will be offered for sale at that time, or
if offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the
requests of any or all Unitholders.


Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.

 INSURED INCOME TRUST, SERIES 92

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 invests in a  
portfolio of long-term bonds. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current
income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7.

                                       -------------            ------------
    Estimated Current Return:           6.03%                    6.07%
    Estimated Long Term Return:         6.01%                    6.05%
       CUSIP:                           92114K-50-1 92114K-51-9

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this estimate on an       
average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also        
reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield   
for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated    
life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for  
maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a         
comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can       
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.   

 PROSPECTUS PART I
 MAY 1, 2002

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part I unless accompanied by Prospectus Part II.

 YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per unit when you redeem them or when your trust terminates.    

(2)  After the first settlement date (May 6, 2002), you will pay accrued        
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(3)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.  

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance       
expenses. Estimated expenses are expected to fluctuate periodically.  

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
   Trust assesses other fees per Unit. (6) During the first year the Trustee
    will reduce its fee by approximately $.19 per Unit (which is the estimated
   interest to be earned prior to the expected delivery dates for the "when,
    as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed
  this amount, the Trustee will reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After
the first year, the Trustee's fee will be the amount indicated above. 
    Estimated interest income will increase to $62.62. Estimated expenses will
    increase to $2.32 and $1.92 under the monthly and semi-annual distribution
  plans, respectively. Estimated net interest income will remain as shown.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO 

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from January 23, 2002
to April 30, 2002.                                                      

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:                        

         COST TO           PROFIT (LOSS)
       SPONSOR            TO SPONSOR
      ---------------      ---------------
$    8,832,176        $     77,778

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate   
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the   
   corresponding gain or loss is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked
  by "##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and
if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins  
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of     
delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the 
first settlement date.                                                  

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an   
  original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part
II. The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is     
described in "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
  issue of bonds. Certain bonds may be subject to redemption without premium
prior to the date shown pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory 
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in  
Prospectus Part II.                                                     

UNDERWRITING. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the
following amounts from the Sponsor. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" in Prospectus Part II.

REPORT OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7):                                           

  We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the portfolio of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7) as of May 1, 2002. The statement of        
condition and portfolio are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our              
responsibility is to express an opinion on such financial statements based on   
our audit.                                                                      

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally    
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of an irrevocable letter of    
credit deposited to purchase bonds by correspondence with the Trustee. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement      
presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Van Kampen Focus Portfolios    
Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series 7) as of May 1, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as 
Sponsor, J.J. Kenny & Co., Inc., as Evaluator, Van Kampen Investment Advisory   
Corp., as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.                     

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to   
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
For a breakdown of your Trust's portfolio, see "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I.
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the    
aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds initially consist of     
delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash     
equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial          
institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to   
the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. A Trust that 
holds primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I,
is referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily      
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds only     
insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". Unless otherwise      
terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of 
the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case
of a Long-Term Trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth 
anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust.         

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are     
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust         
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the     
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by    
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.                    

OBJECTIVE AND BOND SELECTION. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally     
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an 
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by     
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of        
intermediate-term bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will    
achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with   
greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.        

 In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was 
not less than "BBB-", or the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating 
of the bonds was not less than "Baa3", including provisional or conditional     
ratings, respectively, (or, if not rated, the bonds had credit characteristics  
sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing bonds    
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion
of the Sponsor), (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of         
comparable quality and maturity, (c) the diversification of bonds as to purpose 
of issue and location of issuer and (d) with respect to the Insured Trusts, the 
availability and cost of insurance. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease 
to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the   
Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but  
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct 
the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during 
the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                          

   Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been obtained from a bond         
insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see      
"Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price 
nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects 
any element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. See "Public Offering--Offering Price".                            

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's     
rating of "BBB-" or at least the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of      
"Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment
grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement). Insurance is
not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing
credit and provides additional security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, 
a non-cancellable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the
bonds, when due, is issued by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust 
for the insurance obtained by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent 
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured
under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by an 
Insured Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from 
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio    
Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by Standard &    
Poor's. Standard & Poor's describes securities it rates "AAA" as having "the    
highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to  
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

RISK FACTORS. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if   
interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise 
and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before    
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                        

    Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is    
listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay.  

  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that    
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of  
bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is 
considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are 
described in the following sections.                                            

Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become  
smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or 
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

   MORE ABOUT THE BONDS. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

    Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

   Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds
do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are   
actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust
"when, as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be 
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

     NO FDIC GUARANTEE. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of Prospectus Part I. Estimated      
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and   
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

   In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The sales charge for an         
Intermediate-Term Trust is equal to 3.0% of the public offering price per Unit  
(3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the bonds) and the sales charge for a
Long-Term Trust is equal to 4.9% of the public offering price per Unit (5.152%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds). After the initial public offering
period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of
the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal     
Account and accrued interest, if any. The minimum purchase in the primary and   
secondary market is one Unit. In connection with fully disclosed transactions   
with the Sponsor, the minimum purchase is the number of Units stated in the     
contract between the Sponsor and the related broker or agent.                   

The sales charge applicable to quantity purchases during the initial  
offering period is reduced as follows:

   * The breakpoint sales charges are also applied on a dollar basis utilizing a
breakpoint equivalent in the above table of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied 
on whichever basis is more favorable to the investor. The breakpoints will be   
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

     The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life of your Trust's portfolio:

21 to 30                         5.708                          

   For purposes of computation of the estimated long-term return life, bonds
will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the bonds
have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call 
date, in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date; or   
(b) the bonds are subject to a "mandatory tender", in which case the mandatory  
tender will be deemed to be the maturity date. The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   
Expressed as a percent of the Public Offering Price, the sales charge on a Trust
consisting entirely of bonds with 15 years to maturity would be 4.80%.          

    Any reduced sales charge is the responsibility of the selling Underwriter,
broker, dealer or agent. The Sponsor will, however, increase the concession or  
agency commission for quantity purchases.                                       

The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases, during the initial   
offering period table above will apply on all purchases by the same person from 
any one Underwriter or dealer of units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
which are being offered in the initial offering period (a) on any one day (the  
"Initial Purchase Date") or (b) on any day subsequent to the Initial Purchase   
Date, if the units purchased are of a unit investment trust purchased on the    
Initial Purchase Date. In the event units of more than one trust are purchased  
on the Initial Purchase Date, the aggregate dollar amount of such purchases will
be used to determine whether purchasers are eligible for a reduced sales charge.
Such aggregate dollar amount will be divided by the public offering price per   
unit (on the day preceding the date of purchase) of each respective trust       
purchased to determine the total number of units which such amount could have   
purchased of each individual trust. Purchasers must then consult the applicable 
trust's prospectus to determine whether the total number of units which could   
have been purchased of a specific trust would have qualified for a reduced sales
charge and, if so qualified, the amount of such reduction. Assuming a purchaser 
qualifies for a sales charge reduction or reductions, to determine the          
applicable sales charge reduction or reductions it is necessary to accumulate   
all purchases made on the Initial Purchase Date and all purchases made in       
accordance with (b) above. Units purchased in the name of the spouse of a       
purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser ("immediate family        
members") will be deemed for the purposes of calculating the applicable sales   
charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser. The reduced sales charges   
will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for one
or more trust, estate or fiduciary accounts. If you purchased Units on more than
one day to achieve the discounts described in this paragraph, the discount      
allowed on any single day will apply only to Units purchased on that day (a     
retroactive discount is not given on all prior purchases).                      

     For purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for quantity purchases
in the table above, purchasers who have indicated their intent to purchase a    
specified amount of Units of any Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series unit investment trust   
during the initial offering period by executing and delivering a letter of      
intent to the Sponsor, which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to   
the Sponsor and shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months, will be       
eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the tables above based  
on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of     
intent. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder agrees that the first  
purchase of Units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at   
least 5% of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in   
the Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through the establishment of the    
letter of intent, the Unitholder agrees that Units representing 5% of the total 
amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the Trustee pending  
completion of these purchases. All distributions on Units held in escrow will be
credited to the Unitholder's account. If total purchases prior to the expiration
of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a        
Unitholder's letter of intent, the Units held in escrow will be transferred to  
the Unitholder's account. A Unitholder who purchases Units during the letter of 
intent period in excess of the number of Units specified in a Unitholder's      
letter of intent, the amount of which would cause the Unitholder to be eligible 
to receive an additional sales charge reduction, will be allowed such additional
sales charge reduction on the purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to  
reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of Units during 
the letter of intent period. If the total purchases are less than the amount    
specified, the Unitholder involved must pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the  
difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which   
would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied; the Unitholder
will, however, be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching
any lower breakpoint level. If the Unitholder does not pay the additional amount
within 20 days after written request by the Sponsor or the Unitholder's         
securities representative, the Sponsor will instruct the Trustee to redeem an   
appropriate number of the escrowed Units to meet the required payment. By       
establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder irrevocably appoints the Sponsor  
as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the Unitholder's       
escrowed Units, with full power of substitution in the premises. A Unitholder or
his securities representative must notify the Sponsor whenever the Unitholder   
makes a purchase of Units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended     
amount.                                                                         

During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any Van 
Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit     
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust at a reduced sales charge. The reduced     
sales charge will be equal to the lesser of $35 per Unit or 3.50% of the Public 
Offering Price per Unit for a Long-Term Trust and will be equal to the lesser of
$25 or 2.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for an Intermediate Term     
Trust.                                                                          

Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses, children, 
grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, 
sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for   
the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as "related        
purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and Underwriters and  
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the       
applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer concession in  
the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors    
(including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates and vendors      
providing services to the Sponsor may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable dealer concession.                                    

    Purchasers of units of any two consecutive series of a Trust may aggregate
purchases of units of such series for purposes of the sales charge reduction for
quantity purchases, provided that at the time of the initial purchase of units  
such purchaser submitted a purchase order for at least 100 units that was       
partially unfulfilled due to a lack of units of such Trust series available for 
sale at such time. The sales charge reduction shall be applied to the subsequent
purchase of units such that the aggregate sales charge reduction applicable to  
both purchases will equal the amount described in the initial offering period   
sales charge table above.                                                       

   A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in
this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of  
the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section   
called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases. Units may  
be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering Price    
(for purchases which do not qualify for a sales charge reduction for quantity   
purchases) less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and      
dealers for purchases by (1) investors who purchase Units through registered    
investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers 
who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial  
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such     
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which
a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments        
investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment     
authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar        
capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director
or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale to investors or their 
immediate family members (as described above) and (4) officers and directors of 
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through            
subsidiaries or bank affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in    
this prospectus, such investors, bank trust departments, firm employees and bank
holding company officers and directors who purchase Units through this program  
will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases.                

OFFERING PRICE. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the 
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus 
Part I in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of 
Units on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales      
charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the 
number of Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of  
an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial        
offering period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on
days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public
Offering Price of Units accordingly. This Public Offering Price will be         
effective for all orders received at or prior to the Evaluation Time on each    
such day. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock   
Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading. Orders received by  
the Trustee, Sponsor or any Underwriter for purchases, sales or redemptions     
after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be
held until the next determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the   
applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of  
Units outstanding. For secondary market purposes, this computation will be made 
by the Evaluator as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is    
tendered for redemption and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be    
expected to average approximately 0.35-1% more than the bid price.              

   The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices
or offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

     The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your   
Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                               

    A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

     ACCRUED INTEREST. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
shown in the following tables.

 Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an
aggregate of 250 or more Units directly from the Sponsor during the initial     
offering period will receive a net concession equal to the net concession       
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. For individual transactions of less than 250 Units, the Sponsor will     
offer a rebate per Unit equal to the Volume Concession Rebate described in the  
tables above so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate
net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the 
end of the initial offering period.                                             

    Included in the concessions and agency commissions described in the tables
are volume concessions or agency commissions of an additional $5.00 per Unit for
any broker/dealer or agent (other than Underwriters) who purchases from the     
Sponsor at least 250 Units of a Trust during the initial offering period. These 
additional concessions will be allowed at the time of purchase, provided,       
however, the additional concession applicable to initial purchases totaling less
than 250 Units will be paid retroactively at the end of the initial offering    
period. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions are also applied on a  
dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be   
applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The breakpoints
will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars   
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued.                                                                

 For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other
unit investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to      
purchase Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed  
to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for a        
Long-Term Trust and $17.50 per Unit for an Intermediate Term Trust.             

In addition to the concession or agency commission and the volume     
concession rebate set forth in the tables above, all broker-dealers and other   
selling firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a 
Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of (1)   
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in      
appplicable prospectuses) or (2) units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
initially offered prior to December 17, 2001, however, such sales will be       
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set  
forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions. The Sponsor will pay     
these amounts out of its own assets within a reasonable time following each     
Quarterly Period.                                                               

   Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers
on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal
to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the   
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the concession or agency commission   
will amount to 70% of the applicable sales charge. The Sponsor reserves the     
right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to
change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others  
from time to time.                                                              

SPONSOR AND UNDERWRITER COMPENSATION. The Sponsor will sell Units to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession of $22 per Unit underwritten for Intermediate-Term Trusts and $35 per
Unit underwritten for Long-Term Trusts. The net concession earned by            
Underwriters after giving effect to sales charge discounts will equal the       
amounts shown in the tables below. For a list of the Underwriters that have     
purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession. The amounts of these rebates are shown in the table     
above. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for a Trust, the 
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on 
all Units of a Trust distributed during the initial offering period and         
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions   
described under "Unit Distribution."                                            

Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in a Trust will  
receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each Unit it      
underwrites. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar     
basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied  
on whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

    In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also      
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the      
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the        
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may    
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds       
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency       
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits        
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)  
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)        
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and  
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of  
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any 
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

Underwriters and broker-dealers, banks and/or others are eligible to  
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal 
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units 
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under    
which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards
for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such  
firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the   
Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales
generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs.    
Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective 
criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain    
services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units.
Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of the 
assets of any Trust. These programs will not change the price Unitholders pay   
for their Units or the amount that the Trust will receive from the Units sold.  
Approximately every eighteen months the Sponsor holds a business seminar which  
is open to Underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors. The Sponsor pays 
substantially all costs associated with the seminar, excluding Underwriter      
travel costs. Each Underwriter is invited to send a certain number of           
representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites during 
a designated time period.                                                       

    MARKET FOR UNITS. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Units may be available for purchase in connection with "wrap fee" accounts
and other similar accounts. You should consult your financial professional to   
determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these purchases you  
generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is retained by your     
Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult the "Public
Offering--General" section for specific information on this and other sales     
charge discounts.                                                               

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in 
Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain
in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market 
will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner.  
Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a    
card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee  
with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.        
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

  Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

  Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

   REINVESTMENT OPTION. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of your Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc. at 1 Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555.                                                                     

After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust       
distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date  
to purchase shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value     
computed on such date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option 
(PRO) Program account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution        
reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which 
allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations  
of all reinvestments will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. 
A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive   
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five  
days before the next distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and 
investment adviser have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any     
time.                                                                           

REDEMPTION OF UNITS. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units
by tender to the Trustee, at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay    
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing  
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of 
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public 
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on          
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance      
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be  
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.     

    The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or
partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.           

 EXCHANGE OPTION. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to dis-cuss tax         
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

UNITS. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a    
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in          
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the     
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and      
surrender of the certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by 
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the     
written request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears
on the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the       
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the     
Trustee. The Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited  
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or       
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Certificates will be      
issued in denominations of one Unit or any multiple thereof. Although no such   
charge is now made, the Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, 
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for         
replacement.                                                                    

REPORTS PROVIDED. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and
other receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems 
it to be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by independent certified public accountants and the report of  
the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a         
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS 
IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio" for each 
Insured Trust and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed         
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

    The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale 
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Because the bonds are insured by Portfolio Insurers or Preinsured Bond
Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest, when due, and on   
the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's has
assigned to the Units of an Insured Trust its "AAA" investment rating. This     
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of       
Deposit and will, unless renewed, terminate at the end of such period. See      
"Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. This rating should not  
be construed as an approval of the offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or
as a guarantee of the market value of an Insured Trust or of the Units.         

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of  
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     SPONSOR. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The Sponsor is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an indirect  
wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The Sponsor has its 
principal offices at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181-5555. As
of November 30, 2001, the total stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc.   
was $163,449,658 (unaudited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted 
a code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information
on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of
the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,      
deception or misconduct with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement  
contains additional information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot      
perform our duties under the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may
appoint a new sponsor, continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or     
terminate your Trust and distribute the liquidation proceeds.                   

 TRUSTEE. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized
under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust  
division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone     
(800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your Portfolio, 
please contact the Trustee at its unit investment trust division offices or your
financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account       
information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by  
the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal      
Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional        
information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement,   
including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the   
effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and
replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                              

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

REPLACEMENT BONDS. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term, as applicable, bonds, debentures, notes  
or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether    
senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed 
maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no    
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States  
currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted         
securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is United States 
source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt    
from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities     
Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or  
indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services
or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the 
payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the Standard & Poor's AAA rating 
for an Insured Trust; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured   
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and       
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

 AMENDMENT OF TRUST AGREEMENT. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder 
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount
than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For 
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of 
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

   LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax      
consequences of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date 
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these   
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign
taxes. As with any investment, you should consult your own tax professional     
about your particular consequences. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service   
issued new withholding and reporting regulations effective January 1, 2001.     
Foreign investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax       
consequences of these regulations.                                              

     ASSETS OF A TRUST. Each Trust will hold various debt obligations (the "Debt
Obligations"). All of the assets held by a Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." 
For purposes of this federal tax discussion, it is assumed that the Debt        
Obligations constitute debt the interest on which is includible in gross income 
for federal income tax purposes.                                                

     TRUST STATUS. A Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata   
portion of the assets of your trust, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount, and capital gains, if any) from the Trust Assets when such income     
would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Trust       
Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically 
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from the Trust Assets 
which you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced 
by amounts used to pay Trust expenses (including the deferred sales charge, if  
any).                                                                           

    YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of   
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your   
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis 
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, generally including 
sales charges, among each Trust Asset ratably according to their value on the   
date you purchase your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units (for example, in the case of
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

 If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax 
brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for 
long-term gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000, with a     
holding period of more than five years.                                         

 Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period of your Units. The tax     
rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are      
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however,  
treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.          

DISCOUNT, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PREMIUM ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS. Some Debt 
Obligations may have been sold with original issue discount. This generally     
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their   
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and       
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your   
basis of each Debt Obligation which was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.                                

 Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated          
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of 
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price a Trust pays  
for a Debt Obligation or on the price you pay for your Units. Market discount is
taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your Trust        
receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt Obligation is 
disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units. Alternatively,  
you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues.       
Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis  
and the timing of certain interest expense deductions. "Stripped" U.S. Treasury 
obligations are subject to the original issue discount rules, rather than being 
treated as having market discount.                                              

     Alternatively, some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your
Trust at a premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any 
Debt Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable  
at maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize       
premium. If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received
on the Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your  
tax basis will be reduced.                                                      

    If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt Obligation.
When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of
capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.                       

 This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued with
original issue discount.                                                        

  EXCHANGES. If you elect to reinvest amounts received from a Trust into a
future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes, and any  
gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be treated
as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange  
of your Units of your Trust for units of a future trust will generally be       
disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to
the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash    
sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.                                   

    LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the Trust to the same    
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may, however, be required to    
treat some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized       
deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized          
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.               

 FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. Some distributions by your Trust may be
subject to foreign withholding taxes. Any interest withheld will nevertheless be
treated as income to you. However, because you are deemed to have paid directly 
your share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued by your Trust, you   
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for U.S. tax purposes with 
respect to such taxes.                                                          

    If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen
or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you will not  
be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of
the income from your Trust or on gain from the sale or redemption of your Units,
provided that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor   
with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax 
purposes.                                                                       

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trusts for New York tax matters,
the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations and the income of the   
Trusts will be treated as the income of the Unitholders under the existing      
income tax laws of the State and City of New York.                              

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

     SPONSOR, SUPERVISOR, EVALUATOR AND TRUSTEE. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

INSURANCE. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an 
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

RISK FACTORS

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

 TAXABLE MUNICIPAL ISSUES. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power  
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.            

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

  Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

     Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

     Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease 
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from 
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

     Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or   
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

    Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

  Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

   Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

    Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

    Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

     Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

     Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

     Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

   Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

    Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

  Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

ZERO COUPON BONDS. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon" 
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond,
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
each Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior the 
deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal,    
when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, is non-cancellable and will continue in force so  
long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is 
still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by 
such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus Part I).    
Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result
in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action      
against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will
be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium rates for 
each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured Trust are    
fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance policy or 
policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any   
such policy or policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force so long  
as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains in    
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of     
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the   
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the
payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond
defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer  
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is         
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as to
such bond on the date of sale.                                                  

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the    
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy     
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with  
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of 
a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from  
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee     
would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such        
exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less
the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent        
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold
on an uninsured basis.The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible  
for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each 
bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any  
change in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                    

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an    
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)                                                     

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a 
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant  
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent     
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the  
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not     
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the    
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method 
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.            

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancellable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in 
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier than the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac       
Assurance shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant  
is the person entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of  
an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac        
Assurance all right under such bonds to receive the interest of which the       
insurance payment was made.

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of    
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of securities      
offered in domestic and foreign markets. Financial guaranty insurance provides a
guaranty of scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the 
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a premium to 
the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries principally insure         
asset-backed, collateralized and municipal securities. Asset-backed securities  
are generally supported by residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade        
receivables, securites or other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or     
market value. Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage   
bonds and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist largely 
of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other special obligations
of state and local governments. Financial Security insures both newly issued    
securities sold in the primary market and outstanding securities sold in the    
secondary market that satisfy Financial Security's underwriting criteria.       

Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed compay.  
Major shareholders of Holdings include XL Capital Ltd. and The Tokio Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. On March 14, 2000, Holdings announced that it had       
entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Holdings would become a       
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dexia S.A., a publicly held Belgian corporation,     
subject to receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of  
other closing conditions. Dexia S.A., through its bank subsidiaries, is         
primarily engaged in the business of public finance in France, Belgium and other
European countries. No shareholder of Holdings is obligated to pay any debt of  
Financial Security or any claim under any insurance policy issued by Financial  
Security or to make any additional contribution to the capital of Financial     
Security. As of September 30, 2001, the total policyholders' surplus and        
contingency reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively, of   
Financial Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were, in accordance with   
statutory accounting principles, approximately $1,526,197,000 (unaudited) and   
$784,712,000 (unaudited), and the total shareholders' equity and the unearned   
premium reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its consolidated       
subsidiaries were, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  
in the United States, approximately $1,670,116,000 (unaudited), and $646,496,000

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty  
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security or its  
domestic or Bermuda operating insurance company subsidiaries are generally      
reinsured among such companies on an agreed-upon percentage substantially       
proportional to their respective capital, surplus and reserves, subject to      
applicable statutory risk limitations. In addition, Financial Security reinsures
a portion of its liabilities under certain various quota share treaties and on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. This reinsurance is used by Financial Security
as a risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating     
agency requirements; it does not alter on limit the obligations of Financial    
Security under any financial guaranty insurance policy.                         

 Financial Security's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. Financial Security's insurer financial strength is rated
"AAA" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Standard &Poor's (Australia)    
Pty. Ltd. Financial Security's claims-paying ability is rated "AAA" by Fitch

Capital Guranty Insurance Company. On December 20, 1995, Capital Guaranty 
Corporation ("CGC") merged with a subsidiary of Financial Security Assurance    
Holdings Ltd. and Capital Guaranty Insurance Company, CGC's principal operating 
subsidiary, changed its name to Financial Security Assurance of Maryland Inc.   
("FSA Maryland") and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Inc. On September 30, 1997, Financial Security Assurance Inc. assumed 
all of the liabilities of FSA Maryland and sold the FSA Maryland "shell company"
to American Capital Access, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Capital Access
Holdings, Incorporated.                                                         

General. Because the bonds in an Insured Trust are insured as to the timely
payment of principal and interest, when due (as more fully described above), and
on the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's 
has assigned to the Units its "AAA" investment rating. Such rating will be in   
effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of Deposit and will, unless
renewed, terminate at the end of such period. The obtaining of this rating by an
Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the     
Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the market value of the Insured 
Trust or of the Units.                                                          

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to  
obtain a higher yield on the Insured Trust portfolio than would be available if 
all the bonds in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA" rating and yet at   
the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest 
and principal, when due (as more fully described above), on the bonds. There is,
of course, no certainty that this result will be achieved.                      

    In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due (as more fully
described above), in respect of a bond, the appropriate Insurer shall make such 
payment within 30 days after it has been notified that such nonpayment has      
occurred. The appropriate Insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will     
succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof.                        

The information relating to the Insurers has been furnished by the      
respective Insurers. The financial information with respect to the Insurers     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units    
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall  
quality of the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of    
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                    

   The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor   
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other 
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is 
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the       
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the       
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in  
the Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for      
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

 If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio  
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold
such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of   
such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and not 
be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

access to information on Trust transactions to report personal securities       
transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of        
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
Trust. (This paragraph relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to   
any other Series thereof. The information is included herein only for the       
purpose of informing investors as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor
and its ability to carry out its contractual obligations. More detailed         
financial information will be made available by the Sponsor upon request.)      

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

 TRUSTEE INFORMATION

   The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the laws
of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust division offices
at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone (800) 221-7668. The  
Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent
of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal     
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law.                                     

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

TERMINATION OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT

    A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the      
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth    
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust and at the  
end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in 
the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, 
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his    
address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the      
Trustee, such notice specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may   
surrender his certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable 
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The  
sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution       
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS

STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &  
Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the        
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This       
assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as     
guarantors, insurers or lessees.                                                

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

   I.   Likelihood of default--capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in
accordance with the terms of the obligation.                

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt bond
and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest.       

   AA--Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to
pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of instances they
differ from AAA issues only in small degree.                                    

A--Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest,    
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions.                                          

BBB--Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay   
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection 
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more      
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for   
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

Plus (+) or Minus (-): To provide more detailed indications of credit     
quality, the ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the addition of a    
plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being     
rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or     
entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion, 
makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon failure of,  
such completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own judgment with
respect to such likelihood and risk.                                            

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. A brief description of the applicable 
Moody's rating symbols and their meanings follows:                              

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an exceptionally       
stable, margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements   
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues. With the occasional    
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, the safety of obligations  
of this class is so absolute that their market value is affected solely by money
market fluctuations.                                                            

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities. These Aa bonds are high grade, their market value virtually immune  
to all but money market influences, with the occasional exception of oversupply 
in a few specific instances.                                                    

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations. Factors giving security
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. The market 
value of A-rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by credit circumstances 
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions. During periods of   
normalcy, bonds of this quality frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa     
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific      
instances.                                                                      

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments   
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic  
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the high 
end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the      
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating
category.                                                                       

  Con--Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or
the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are bonds      
secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of projects
unseasoned in operating experience, (c) rentals which begin when facilities are 
completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting condition attaches.     
Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of         
construction or elimination of basis of condition.                              

 ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO UNITHOLDERS

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials, energy, financial services, healthcare, consumer staples and utility industries. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.An issuer of Securities held by the Trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the financial services and utility industries, and, as a result of its expected higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust is expected to exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
