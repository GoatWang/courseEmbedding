Important Mutual Fund Information:
Consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus Opens in a new window and the summary prospectus contain this and other information about the fund. Contact your financial professional for a prospectus and the summary prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.
An investment in our money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the funds seek to preserve the value of your clients investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the funds.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Some mutual funds have more risk than others. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate and investor's shares when sold may be worth more or less than the original cost. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. Asset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There is no guarantee a Fund's objectives will be achieved. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. Your clients should consult with their attorney, accountant, and/or tax professional for advice concerning their particular situation.

The information is not intended as investment advice and is not a recommendation about managing or investing your retirement savings. In providing these materials PGIM Investments is not acting as your fiduciary as defined by the Department of Labor. Please consult with a qualified investment professional if you wish to obtain investment advice.
Important Closed-End Fund Information:
A closed-end fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost, and you could lose all or a portion of your investment. The use of leverage as an investing strategy can magnify losses and increase fees paid by the Fund. Shares of the Fund may trade on the exchange at a discount to their net asset value. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, where their value will decline as interest rates rise.
An investment in the Fund's shares of common stock may be speculative in that it involves a high degree of risk and should not constitute a complete investment program. Each closed-end fund will have its own unique investment strategy, risks, charges and expenses that need to be considered before investing.
