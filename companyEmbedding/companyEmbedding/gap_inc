Be the world’s favorite for American style
Doris and Don Fisher opened the first Gap store in 1969 with a simple idea — to make it easier to find a pair of jeans and a commitment to do more. Over the last 46 years, the company has grown from a single store to a global fashion business with five brands — Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta and Intermix. Gap's clothes are available in 90 countries worldwide through 3,300 company-operated stores, almost 400 franchise stores, and e-commerce sites and is still growing.

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors.

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

Gap's New Retail Approach and How It's Affecting Sales


In light of changing buyer expectations and behaviors (as well as a shifting global economy), Gap has made deliberate moves towards a radically different retail strategy.

Not long ago, Gap and its related retailers were among the most popular destinations for back-to-school shoppers. With apparel and accessory options at various price points for all age groups, the classic brand once enjoyed spiked sales and soaring profits during the late summer and early fall.However, Gap's most recent sales numbers appear to show a shift away from its favored status in the hearts (and wallets) of shoppers. Although the company aggressively advertised and discounted throughout back-to-school season, sales remained stagnant. The lone bright spot during the month was the "positive momentum" gained by its Old Navy stores.Recent changes to Gap, Inc.'s retail strategy are raising the question of whether the brand is making the right choices to remain competitive. Could its August sales slump be an indicator of more bad news to come?What Has Been Changing at Gap, Inc.? The company's multi-pronged approach shows several deviations from its previous approach, including:Expansion in Asia. The growing apparel markets in the East have attracted the retailer, which is set to open 40 stores in India and 110 in China over the next year. Rising incomes and massive populations in the region make it an area of enormous potential for Gap and its related lifestyle brands.Acquisition of new brands. Shoppers have been familiar with Gap brands Banana Republic and Old Navy for years, but the company has continued to acquire new online and virtual brands, such as Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix. This has diversified its offerings as well as its target audiences.Fewer brick and mortars. In 2011, Gap closed the doors to 21% of its stores in the United States. At the time, the retailer cited higher efficiency and profit margins as the objective for its store closings.Online sales focus. At the same time, Gap has been placing a greater emphasis on sales through Gap.com, which also conveniently links to its other brands for a seamless and all-encompassing shopping experience for its brand enthusiasts. Although these tactics have met with varying levels of success, their impact on the brand's long-term growth and global reputation will continue to unfold over the next several years. This will certainly serve as a lesson to its competitors as they formulate their global strategies, both virtually and online. How Balancing Physical & Virtual Locations Helps Companies When companies like Gap operate brick and mortar retail establishments in addition to ecommerce websites, the balancing act between the two can be a challenge. However, when businesses achieve this, it yields a number of benefits to the corporation and its customers alike, including:Personal connections. The ability to walk into a store, try on clothes, and talk with retail associates is something many shoppers value. When too few physical stores remain within an individual's area, he or she may choose companies with a stronger brick and mortar presence.Touch points. Brands that meet their customers wherever they are stand the best chance of remaining competitive in a multidimensional economy. Those unlikely to visit a mall or shopping center may be more apt to make a purchase from an online retailer, while online advertising and sales efforts may be lost on those preferring a more traditional shopping experience.Purchasing options. Online and in-store shopping each present their own advantages and disadvantages, which may apply to the same shoppers at different times during the same day, month, or week. Someone who needs a new outfit the next day can't afford to wait for a purchase to ship, whereas someone with a busy work schedule may be unable to walk into a store during its business hours. In addition, an online purchase remains impossible for those seeking to pay with cash.When providing online and in-store shopping options, one of the most important components of the retail experience is the point of sale. A business offering a wide range of payment options and making the process as quick and uncomplicated as possible will enjoy the highest numbers of converted and returning customers.One way to achieve this is by utilizing high-quality point-of-sale systems. Businesses of all sizes can accept a wide range of payment types with new mobile payment options such as Square and PayPal, which attach directly to one's mobile device and allow them to complete transactions anywhere they travel. For online businesses, comprehensive POS systems such as Shopify make completing purchases an attractive prospect for customers.For Gap and other retailers combining brick and mortar and ecommerce locations, it is crucial to make every aspect of the customer's experience more convenient, enjoyable, and memorable. With a balanced, versatile, and streamlined approach to business, brands of all sizes can achieve sustained growth in their chosen markets.Do you think Gap, Inc.'s recent business strategies will ultimately help or harm the brand?

Art Peck, a nine-year Gap Inc. veteran, looks forward to being “out there in the messy mosh pit of change.”
By Danielle Sackslong ReadDefeat, it turns out, smells a lot like cinnamon rolls. On a Saturday afternoon in January, the cheap-caloried aroma of Cinnabon permeates New Jersey’s two-story Livingston Mall, distracting visitors from an increasingly visible reality.advertisementThe 43-year-old shopping center’s fleet of modest stores—so familiar and accessible to customers for more than a generation—are turning into a liability.Between a lackluster Sears on one end of the mall and a Macy’s on the other, four naked mannequins and an empty metal rolling hanger are all that remain in the fresh graveyard of Wet Seal, the teen retailer that recently announced it’s shuttering two-thirds of its stores. “One day they’re remodeling, the next day it’s closed,” mutters the teenager working the cell-phone repair cart outside the store. Across the way, at an Aeropostale kids’ shop, an everything must go! sign hangs in the window. “We’re closing Tuesday,” explains the girl at the register, sipping a smoothie while assembling a 200-piece puzzle. “They’re going online.” Next door is a large, empty storefront, freshly vacated by a Toys “R” Us, while at the other end of the corridor, teen retailer Delia’s, which recently announced liquidation, flaunts its own going out of business sign. “Once malls like the Livingston Mall lose competitive edge in a market, they can’t compete,” says D.J. Busch, mall analyst for Green Street Advisors, who predicts that 15% of lower- to mid-tier malls will disappear over the next decade. “Once you lose a good tenant, others will follow. Retail works that way—you follow the mob.”

Four miles away, at the Mall at Short Hills, tony brands like Bur­berry, Calypso St. Barth, and Chanel draw shoppers from all over the state. “Malls are the story of the haves and have-nots,” says Busch, who believes that destinations like Short Hills will continue to thrive. E-commerce has devoured lower-end malls, but “customers still want to try on, touch, and feel high-end apparel,” he adds. “As goes Middle America, so goes the middle-American mall,” says Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail. The result is the latest wave of retail Darwinism: the classic American shopping emporiums that put downtown Main Streets out of business in the 1960s are now themselves on their way to extinction.All of this has been weighing on Art Peck, who has just become CEO of the company arguably most synonymous with malls: Gap Inc., which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic. “Gap was founded in 1969, when malls were being built, real estate was coming available, and consumer shopping patterns were being trained,” says Peck, a slim 59-year-old, who was dressed in a hooded black leather Rag & Bone bomber jacket when I first met him in December, two months before he started his new job. “Gap essentially rode the wave of that initial change in retail, that mall building boom that took place for 30 or 40 years.” The brand enjoyed a 15-year reign over classically cool, affordable American style, but it has spent the past decade-plus struggling with an identity crisis while new retailers have colonized much of its domain. The iconic brand slept through the fast-fashion revolution fueled by the likes of European labels H&M and Zara; got lost amid competitors such as Uniqlo and Target, who offered basics and denim at higher and lower price points; overexpanded; and became too ubiquitous for today’s niche-minded fashion crowd. “We used to talk about the ‘Gapification of America,’ that notion of one size fits all,” says WSL’s Liebmann. “That’s just not a proposition relevant to America now.” Between 2006 and 2010, sales dropped every year at Gap’s North American stores; since 2013, store sales have continued to suffer.

Into this reality rides a former consultant turned digital believer with perhaps an impossible task: to make the once-iconic business relevant again. It is a task echoed throughout our economy—at brands like Yahoo and MTV, JCPenney, and Buick. Peck has spent the past nine years moving up through a variety of roles at the $16 billion apparel conglomerate, which includes newcomers Athleta and Intermix. He is convinced that the company’s future will depend not just on delivering better product but on radical experimentation. Gap thrived in the heyday of the mall—what Peck calls Retail 1.0—and floundered in the fast-fashion wave he calls Retail 2.0. Gap’s hope, he explains, is to leapfrog ahead to win in the Retail 3.0 era: a mobile-fueled future in which physical stores will have an entirely new role. “We’ve been doing business the same way for 40 years, and there are very few 40-year-old business models that are successful forever,” Peck says. “Periods of disruption are periods of disproportionate opportunity,” he continues, laying the stakes. “More money is made during disruptive times—but is also lost—than is made during times of stability.” So what will that store of tomorrow deliver? And how soon before Gap rolls it out near you? Peck props his foot on his knee, gripping his lower leg with both hands like an oar. Predicting what form that store will take is the puzzle he’s trying to solve.If there’s one item of clothing that both inspires and haunts Peck, it’s colored denim. He refers to the Colored Denim Period often in conversation, as if drifting back to memories of an old summer fling: bold punches of greens, yellows, fuchsias, and aquas in the form of skinny, cropped, and broken-in jeans and khakis. It represented a rare moment in the company’s recent history (February 2012, to be exact) when the Gap brand was ahead of a fashion trend yet true to its heritage—casual, American, optimistic. Peck was running the North American arm of the Gap at the time and he gambled big, letting stores run dry on other inventory in advance. “Then we flowed the product,” he recalls. “I kept looking at my head merchant, asking, ‘Where are the numbers?’ Day one, day two, day three, four, six, seven—then, boom, it hit, and the comps went through the roof.” It was the brand’s best-selling line in years.advertisement

Distressed Denim?
CEO Art Peck inherits a company with stagnating store sales—but bright digital prospects.




Peck’s office, at Gap HQ in San Francisco, looks more like a designer’s den than an executive suite, evoking the confidence and whimsy of the Colored Denim Period. There’s no desk. A series of hacked Barbie dolls (a “family art project,” he explains, referring to his wife and four kids—two of whom work for Old Navy) line the windowsill; a decou­paged dress form topped by a soldier’s Vietnam War helmet (“worn by a guy who apparently, in the boredom of fighting a war, had a hot glue gun and glued pistol cartridges to it”) stands in the corner; and a tattered mustard-yellow rough road sign leans in the corner (“it’s irony”). The walls of the conference room next door are checkerboarded with another art project: 15 mini–David Hockney replicas, painted by Peck and his tech leadership team as a creative exercise. “There was a fair amount of wine flowing,” he admits.If there’s one item of clothing that both inspires and haunts Peck, it’s colored denim. Although there’s retail in Peck’s blood—a distant relative helped found Woolworth’s back in 1879, and his grandfather helped grow it globally—he didn’t find his way into the field until his late forties. After graduating from Harvard Business School, he spent 20 years at the Boston Consulting Group, advising executives at large industrial, technology, and entertainment companies and working for the likes of Universal Music when digital file-sharing services such as Napster started to emerge. “I can remember executives arguing that a customer will never not want their music in physical form. There was a lot of denial,” Peck recalls. “I’ve seen this again and again—by the time change has happened around a company, they panic and reflexively react to it. It’s oftentimes too late. To be out there in the messy mosh pit of change with unclear direction and unclear implications, that’s much more important.”Peck jumped into the mosh pit in 2005, after Gap’s then–CEO Paul Pressler hired BCG to help identify growth opportunities—and ended up bringing Peck in-house to lead the company’s strategy and corporate development. “The most important things in my life have been unexpected, unplanned forks in the road,” says Peck (who met his wife on a blind date). He worked with Bob Fisher, son of Gap founder Don Fisher and then the non–executive chairman of the board, to cut costs—which included shutting down experiments such as Forth & Towne, a failed attempt to grab the over-35 set. Peck also suggested that the company accelerate international growth by franchising to local operators instead of relying on wholly owned stores. “We would surely not be as global as we are today were it not for Art,” says Eric Severson, Gap’s SVP of talent, who has worked closely with Peck for years.Peck has spent his time at Gap steadily hopping from one area to another, always with good results. He’s overseen operations and global logistics, led the acquisitions of activewear brand Athleta and upscale women’s fashion retailer Intermix, and ran Gap’s profitable outlet business (his first experience managing a P&L).In 2011, the company’s next CEO, Glenn Murphy, appointed Peck president of Gap North America, which had suffered years of falling sales. “What most leaders do is spend all this time analyzing, diagnosing, and then building a huge plan that you unveil,” says Severson. “Art is much more firmly rooted in get in, and start doing.” Peck had one priority: fix the product. Much of the problem, he concluded, stemmed from a fractured creative team—from design to merchandising to marketing. “The store felt one way, the service felt another way, the product felt another way, and the marketing was another way,” says Severson. “It was cognitive dissonance.” Peck fired Gap’s high-profile head of design, Patrick Robinson, and camped out in Gap’s New York Design Center. One weekend, he hotboxed all the top leaders in a room until they came to a consensus on a cohesive look. The gambit worked: The clothing created during Peck’s two years as head of the Gap brand led to eight straight positive quarters (including the Colored Denim Period), its best run in years—all without a head of design.Peck’s near-term priority as CEO is, once again, to fix the product. On a brisk January day, he stands at the mouth of Gap’s flagship store in Midtown Manhattan. “I’m glad to see yellow, because color has been lacking in the assortment. But it’s not the most democratic color,” he observes. He’s digesting the latest merchandise with Jeff Kirwan, who has spent the past four years building Gap Inc.’s China presence and whom Peck just put in charge of the Gap brand. Only one week into his new job, Kirwan can see the challenges ahead. “We’ve stuck with some old historical winners that have started to fall off the cliff. We’ve held on to them too long,” says Kirwan, pointing to a pile of skinny jeans that don’t have enough stretch in them. Adds Peck, “The trend in denim right now is the destructive and destroyed denim, and our washes are clean. We missed a little bit of the trend.” Then Peck wanders over to a table of cashmere sweaters and picks up a heather grey one. “It’s a really nice cashmere, but it’s a really tight crew neck. That’s not a feminine neckline at all,” he says, disappointed. “My guess is I could buy this in a large and wear it.”advertisement

A Tight Spot
Gap, founded in 1969, pioneered the idea of casual, affordable cool. Today, competitors encroach from every direction—and these are just the ones with actual, physical stores.
Gap
Challenge: Stuck in the middle, it’s been losing relevance as competition chips away from all sides.
Strategy: Boost design, materials, and production cycle to reestablish itself as an iconic brand.
Old Navy
Challenge: The “basics” brand has gone too basic, veering toward generic, cheap clothing.
Strategy: Make trends accessible at a low price point (already showing signs of progress).
Banana Republic
Challenge: Has developed a staid and serious “dressing for work” reputation. 
Strategy: Give J.Crew vet Marissa Webb freedom to steer the brand into more fashion-forward territory; her first line debuted in March.







Androgynous cuts, bland colors, and missing trends completely have been just a few of the issues plaguing Gap’s women’s collection since Peck stepped away from day-to-day management of the brand two years ago. After he left, the company hired a new creative director, Rebekka Bay, a Danish trend forecaster and design consultant who cut her reputation launching H&M’s more modern, upscale Cos brand. Bay tried to bring a fashion-forward basics sensibility back to the brand, but items like a T-shirt dress ended up too minimalist and boxy for the Gap customer. One of her more daring touches this past season was reviving Gap’s “Crazy Stripe” sweater from the mid-2000s, which boasts a rainbow’s worth of colors. While not referring specifically to that sweater, Peck commented to his staff: “It’s a sign of the times, unfortunately, that when there was an Ugly Christmas Sweater Party at the company, some of the sweaters there were from our current assortment. That’s not the way it should be.” By late January, Bay was out.The faster you are in conceiving product and putting it on the shelf, the less risk there is.At the Manhattan flagship store, Peck directs my gaze away from the bustling “Sale” section that appears to be a magnetic force for customers. “We’re not going to allow you to go over there,” he tells me, only half teasing. Training customers to expect chronic discounts has become a destructive cycle at Gap. He knows that he has to “pull out the promo needle,” as the industry puts it. To do so, Gap needs to ramp up its Retail 2.0 capability: Right now, he says, it takes the brand at least 10 months to get its new product ideas into stores. That’s about three times as long as competitors like H&M and Zara, which have built their success by hopping onto the fashion world’s hottest trends and riding them. “We’re an industry that guesses a lot,” says Peck, who is working with vendors across the entire supply chain to cut production time down to around 30 weeks. “The faster you are in conceiving product and putting it on the shelf, the less risk there is.”If Peck’s time as the head of the Gap brand gave him a road map for attacking the company’s product woes, it was his next job—the one he had just before he became CEO—that provided him with the skills for imagining Retail 3.0. For two years, Peck headed the awkwardly named “GID” division (for “growth, innovation, and digital”). This was the group in charge of the company’s smaller, high-growth brands, e-commerce, and so-called omnichannel offerings—industry jargon for bridging digital and physical retail. He introduced retail services such as “Reserve in Store,” “Find in Store,” and “Ship From Store,” and digitized its entire product inventory. Peck didn’t have technical engineering skills, but he pushed the group to infuse a sense of humanity into the company’s e-commerce products, and he was never afraid to question things. “If you looked at the way we presented ourselves on smartphones two years ago, it was highly utilitarian. Big buttons, gray, prominent text,” says Sol Goldfarb, the company’s executive VP of digital and customer experience. “Art kept saying, ‘It’s not good enough, it’s not good enough, you’re not there.’ Art taught us that choosing convenient and transactional versus emotional and engaging is a false dichotomy.”Art taught us that choosing convenient and transactional versus emotional and engaging is a false dichotomy.For years, Peck has focused on dissolving the wall between physical and digital. During the two years he ran the Gap brand, Peck shrank its U.S. footprint by shuttering more than 225 locations “in malls where real estate wasn’t productive,” he says. Now, as CEO, Peck hints that the number and size of the company’s 3,680 stores will inevitably shrink. He plans to make mobile the central point of all customer interactions—though he’s not exactly sure how. “I would like to be able to articulate a nice linear path as to what our stores are going to evolve to,” he says. “But I think it’s going to be a lot messier than that.” He’s testing showroom formats, mobile registers, RFID–tagged clothing, interactive digital walls, and even something that might resemble a vending machine. Peck has developers in Silicon Valley camped out at Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores, incorporating customer and salesperson feedback into code in real time. “I think that kind of rapid prototyping—typical in a lot of other industries, not so typical in ours—will be critical for figuring out this collision of physical and digital,” he says.Peck’s enthusiasm in this area is one of the key reasons he was tapped to be CEO. “As the board thought about the kinds of skills the new leader should have, digital operations skills were pretty far up the list,” says Bob Fisher. “Art was the unanimous choice.” Michael Silverstein, who ran BCG’s retail practice for 25 years, was one of the people Peck turned to in weighing the decision to accept. Silverstein advised him that it was a rare opportunity to reinvent retail at a moment filled with uncertainty—something Peck was wired for.

“Art’s running the company as if it’s a smaller company,” says Jyothi Rao, Intermix’s new president, whom Peck recruited from Gilt Groupe, where she ran its women’s and kids’ divisions. Rao recalls negotiating a critical new hire when the process hit a bump. “We could have gone through two or three layers in our HR organization,” says Rao. “But I just texted Art and said, ‘Are you cool with this?’ And he got back to me in less than one minute.” Nancy Green, a 21-year Gap Inc. vet who’s now running its fast-growing Athleta business, says that Peck understands how to cultivate entrepreneurs within a large organization: “What Art always says is, ‘What do you need from me?’ And I’ll say to him, ‘I need you to remove that wall for me, please.’ He’s like, ‘Okay, let’s figure it out.’ ”advertisement

For all the criticism Gap has faced, its digital competence has never been questioned. “They’ve always been ahead of the curve,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce analyst at Forrester. The retailer builds almost all of its technology in-house, has been aggressive with services that straddle the physical and digital, and boasts one of the most elegant digital interfaces for its $2.26 billion e-commerce business, where most of the brand’s sales growth is coming from these days. “Gap is one of those brands that’s at an inflection point,” says Mulpuru. “It will either go the way of JCPenney, with its glory days behind it, or do what J.Crew has done: have a massive retrenching and turn the business around.”As Peck works to remedy lapses in the company’s Retail 2.0 proficiency and build a digital framework for Retail 3.0, he’s simultaneously creating a bridge that will allow the company to move smoothly from one to the other. That bridge, odd as it may seem, is fashion. Peck undoubtedly watched J.Crew elevate its brand prestige by debuting collections on the runway, and recently took a page from that playbook. In February, for the first time, Banana Republic revealed its latest line at New York’s Fashion Week, under new design chief Marissa Webb.Webb is arguably now Gap Inc.’s most fashionable employee. On the snowy winter day when I visited, she may have been the only woman in New York showing toe cleavage. Webb, J.Crew’s former head of women’s design, is walking Peck through a preview of her fall 2015 collection, bare skin exposed between her three-inch heels and cuffed navy wool trousers. An independent thinker, she represents a new type of dynamic Peck hopes to have with creatives. “Every time he comes to town he wants to meet at my [personal] studio,” says Webb. After leaving J.Crew in 2011, she launched an eponymous fashion line and had been running it for three years when Gap Inc. came calling last spring. Banana Republic was a staid brand trying to shake its work-wear reputation; then–CEO Murphy sent Peck in to meet with her. “I was the closer,” Peck says with a grin.Fashion has the potential to bring some necessary buzz to the company (remember when the First Family wore J.Crew to the inauguration?), but more important, it offers Gap Inc. two things it desperately needs in order for Peck’s overall vision to succeed: trend insights and credibility. Intermix, which sells high-priced wares from designers like Valentino and Derek Lam, will give Gap Inc. immediate access to fashion information and serve as a trend breeding ground for the company’s other brands. So will Peck’s relationship with Emily Current and Meritt Elliott, the L.A. duo behind Current/Elliott. After they designed the Boyfriend Jean—a trend that rocked women’s wear in 2008—Peck reached out to them for lunch, and they began a relationship that led to consulting work for the Gap brand. Last year, Peck became a personal investor in their newly hatched brand, the Great. (Peck says that his stake in the high-end brand isn’t considered competitive with Gap Inc.) “He allows any creative person to feel free,” says Current. The pair were recently named style ambassadors for Old Navy.

Then, of course, there’s Webb. In hiring her, Gap made an unprecedented financial investment in her namesake brand, knowing that it could provide valuable early intelligence—and perspective. “It’s the two extremes of the industry,” says Peck. “Ours is a big machine that sits in the corner every day and says, ‘Feed me.’ And [hers is] this relatively small business where the pure essence of it is product, nothing else—no politics, no process. I think it’s a healthy [way] to always remind us what job number one is.” Webb, who now juggles both Banana and her own line simultaneously, says she’s found a like-minded partner in Peck. “It’s an honest relationship,” she says. “He calls it as he sees it, and I respect that. He’ll send me a text and I’ll send him a text back. It’s very fast, very scrappy.”Now, once Gap develops its fast-fashion machinery, it will know precisely how to deploy it.advertisementNone of this, of course, guarantees that Gap will succeed. As Peck takes the helm, Old Navy—now led by former executives from H&M and Nike—is on the upswing. Athleta, in the booming “athleisure” space, has the company’s fastest growth prospects, along with Gap Inc.’s Asian expansion. Peck killed e-commerce experiment Piperlime. He removed Bay and installed Limited Brands vet Wendi Goldman as Gap’s first executive vice president of product design and development. The pruning and buffing under way are always good practices, and Gap’s faster-fashion effort will be a smart investment no matter what—retail certainly isn’t slowing down. Plus, there could be more acquisitions ahead. (Some think the company should buy a retailer like Uniqlo, which still has yet to fully conquer North America, but Peck is more interested in smaller startup businesses that have a lot of growth ahead of them. “I tend to get much more excited about those,” he says.) Still, no one can answer that ultimate question of what a Retail 3.0 store will look like. No one knows.

For all the ground it lost with fast fashion, Gap might be in the best position to find out. It’s already ahead of competitors like H&M and Zara when it comes to a digital and mobile presence. If, by generating desirable, on-trend clothing and lots of good buzz, Gap can establish an emotional connection with consumers, perhaps it can then lead them anywhere, be it to a mall, an app, or a vending machine. In December, two months before officially becoming Gap’s CEO, Peck held his final meeting with his GID team. He riffed about “the wonderfully messy, ugly, disruptive time” that Gap’s business was entering, “the beginning of a shakeout” rippling across the apparel industry, and his hope that his legacy as CEO will be that “we grabbed it, wrestled it, and we are killing it.”The role of the store is evolving.There’s a Gap at New Jersey’s Livingston Mall, wedged between the surrendered Wet Seal and liquidating Aeropostale kids’ store. On an early January day, an end of season sale sign hangs in the window, next to mannequins dressed for the gym. Seven of the 10 shoppers inside rummage through the discounted merchandise. There’s another Gap one town over, at the Short Hills mall, where there’s also a Banana Republic. Webb’s fall 2015 collection will arrive in August. Many customers will see it first—and shop from it—on their phones. “The role of the store is evolving,” says Peck. “What it’s going to become is something that we and the customers will figure out, together, over time.” Luckily, when it comes to fashion, customers are always looking to try on something new.

Product in motion: Gap Inc.’s photo studio captures clothing to fit your lifestyle

March 20, 2017Design, TechnologyKelly Flanagan and Brooke Ginnard, Gap Inc. bloggers2 Comments


Design is in the details. And it takes obsession with detail to breathe life into that irresistible piece of clothing. These are the people behind the scenes at Gap Inc. — the dedicated professionals who push themselves every day to create customer experiences that resonate. Get to know these heroes of their craft.“Shopping" no longer just means shopping in brick and mortar stores. Browsing and buying online has become one of the primary ways we all shop. But have you ever wondered what's behind the experience of shopping online?Enter Gap Inc.'s Photo Studio. The San Francisco-based team captures all of the photos found on Gap.com, BananaRepublic.com, OldNavy.com and Athleta.com with the goal of helping online shoppers evaluate clothing length and fit, fabric thickness and texture, and how well their potential purchases will pair with different outfits — all without trying on a single piece.Although Gap is currently testing a virtual dressing room, photography is often the first point of contact brands have with their customers — whether that's in the form of marketing campaigns, advertising, content on social media, or on ecommerce sites — and it's the main way online shoppers evaluate whether or not to pursue the product they're interested in all the way through to checkout, or abandon their shopping carts entirely. (Think of your own experience in this regard: How do you navigate buying something online?) 



















To make that online shopping experience even more dynamic than it is today, the Photo Studio at Gap Inc. is experimenting with a new three-dimensional approach to the way in which its brands highlight clothing online. Studio teams work with brand styling and merchandising teams to capture clothing from different angles, on models presenting lifelike poses — ideally allowing shoppers to see how each piece falls from all angles, get inspired by the different ways to wear and style clothing, and eventually imagine how it may fit into their own lives (and wardrobes).“Everything that we're doing here is aimed at helping our customer better understand how a piece of clothing will fit," explains stylist Katharine Adams. “We also try to inspire them to see themselves in the clothing."Teams at Gap Inc.'s Photo Studio are divided by brand, ensuring that the product styling, model styling, art direction and overall look-and-feel are authentic to the unique brand being showcased, so that each brand feels distinct.The folks at the Photo Studio are a talented bunch. They're flexible enough to pivot to the needs of each brand, but one of the most valuable parts of their process is that this kind of streamlined, all-in-one approach to online product photography allows Gap Inc. brands to share learnings with one another, experiment with different photography styles, and really learn what kind of online experiences their customers are interested in — across Gap Inc.'s entire portfolio of brands.

                          Sustainable Product                                                      Great product that has been designed with sustainability in mind

As one of the world’s largest apparel retailers, we recognize that with our size comes a great responsibility to the people who make our clothes, and to our shared planet. At the same time, our global scale presents a greater opportunity to make a difference. That’s why we are committed to integrating sustainability more deeply into every aspect of our business, from the materials we source, to the suppliers that we work with, and ultimately the clothes that we all wear.
We are committed to continual improvements in the design and development of great product, that looks good, and leaves the world a better place.



 


























 



Gap Denim 

As part of our Gap for Good initiative launched in 2016, we are stitching together programs and partnerships to reduce the environmental impact of denim manufacturing. We have started with two important components that go into our denim manufacturing, cotton and water.
Supporting Sustainable Cotton
Cotton is essential to our business. It gives our 1969 denim the strength and comfort it’s known for. Cotton also supports the livelihoods of millions of people around the world. That’s why, in 2016, we joined the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) to partner on sustainable cotton farming initiatives worldwide. From farmworker training, to water conservation and chain of custody traceability, using Better Cotton reinforces our commitment to sustainable production of the world’s most important natural fiber.
Washwell: Innovation in Denim Wash
Building on our commitments to Women + Water, designers at Gap are taking this work one step further by finding ways to save water and reduce pollution through the design choices they make – while staying true to the look and feel of denim that customers love. For example, selected Gap denim washes now incorporate plant-based fabric softeners that are certified by the USDA as BioPreferred®, a positive step forward in the effort to eliminate hazardous chemicals and protect the health of workers and waterways. Smart denim wash techniques have already saved millions of liters of water, and product design teams are working to further increase these savings.

Athleta Repetition Tank & Tee

Instead of relying on traditional methods of dyeing fabric, we have introduced planet-friendly technology which reduces water usage and pollution.
Waterless Dyeing Technology
Our Repetition Tee and Tank are made using DryDye® technology, a waterless dyeing process which saves 4.5 gallons of water per garment and eliminates the need for chemical additives. This revolutionary technique differs from conventional dyeing in that it uses compressed CO2 to penetrate and color fibers, replacing water by up to 95%.
