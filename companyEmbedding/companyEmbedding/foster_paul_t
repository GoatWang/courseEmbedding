                K. Neill Foster with Paul L. King Although the subject is frequently referenced in Scripture, very little has been written about binding and loosing. In this ground-breaking volume, popularly written within an academic framework, Foster traces the history of the doctrine from the Old Testament to the Early Church Fathers, the Reformers and the past 150 years to the present. Thoroughly documented. Generously illustrated.

                Very little is written about binding and loosing, though it is referred to numerous times in Scripture. Binding and Loosing engages those references under such topics as: Jewish Concepts of Binding and Loosing; Binding, Loosing and Prayer Walks; Loosing as Forgiveness; Binding, Loosing and Politics; Binding and Loosing-False and True; a total of 27 chapters plus four appendices, bibliography, subject and Scripture indexes. Combined with compelling illustrations and first-person accounts from around the world, Binding and Loosing provides practical and eye-opening revelations into the authority of the believer to wage war--and win.

Product Description▼▲
With roots in British and American endeavors to restore apostolic Christianity, the Stone-Campbell Movement drew its inspiration from the independent efforts of nineteenth-century religious reformers Barton W. Stone and the father-son team of Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The union of these two movements in the 1830s and the growth of the new body thrust it into a place of significance in early nineteenth-century America, and it quickly spread to other parts of the English-speaking world.From its beginnings the Movement has developed into one of the most vital and diverse Christian traditions in the world. Today it encompasses three major American communions - Churches of Christ, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and Christian Churches/Churches of Christ - as well as united churches in several other countries. Reprinted in a paperback edition, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement offers a sweeping historical and theological treatment of this complex, vibrant global communion. Written by more than 300 contributors, this major reference work contains over 700 original articles covering all of the significant individuals, events, places, and theological tenets that have shaped the Movement. Much more than simply a historical dictionary, this volume also constitutes an interpretive work reflecting historical consensus among Stone-Campbell scholars, even as it attempts to present a fair, representative picture of the rich heritage that is the Stone-Campbell Movement. Scores of photographs and illustrations (many quite rare) enrich and enliven the text, and an extensive, carefully prepared index facilitates ready access to important information throughout the volume.

Author Bio▼▲
Douglas A. Foster is professor of church history anddirector of the Center for Restoration Studies at AbileneChristian University in Abilene, Texas.


Endorsements▼▲
Two hundred years ago Barton W. Stone, Thomas and Alexander Campbell, and their many associates participated in a movement to unite Christians, restore faith and practice of New Testament Christianity, promote mission, and advance spiritual maturity.  That endeavor resulted in millions of adherents now spread throughout the world.  In entries ranging from short notes to extended treatises, the editors and three hundred competent contributors to this encyclopedia give balanced and comprehensive attention to the contemporary expressions of the Stone-Campbell Movement  the Churches of Christ, Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).  They have produced a scholarly, authoritative, and readable text that gives historical and theological information important to members of these churches and to all those interested in modern church history.
-Everett Ferguson,
Abilene Christian University
This encyclopedia is as usefully informative as it is carefully crafted.  Americas vigorous Restorationist churches, personalities, publications, institutions of higher learning, and associations have long needed a comprehensive and discerning interpretive guide.  This volume meets that need splendidly. 
-Mark A. Noll,
Wheaton College
Historians of American religion have long puzzled over the various and confusing congeries of the Stone-Campbell Movement.  This remarkable volume provides an indispensable guide to understanding this important tradition. 
-Randall Balmer,
Barnard College, Columbia University


Editorial Reviews▼▲
Disciples World "This encyclopedia should be in every church, every involved Disciple's home library, and every church-related institution."Everett Ferguson "Two hundred years ago Barton W. Stone, Thomas and Alexander Campbell, and their many associates participated in a movement to unite Christians, restore the faith and practice of New Testament Christianity, promote mission, and advance spiritual maturity.

Noll "This encyclopedia is as usefully informative as it is carefully crafted. America's vigorous Restorationist churches, personalities, publications, institutions of higher learning, and associations have long needed a comprehensive and discerning interpretive guide. This volume meets that need splendidly."David E. Harrell Jr. "This weighty volume is a stunning accomplishment. It is sweeping in scope but rich in detail. The articles explore virtually every niche and corner of this diverse religious movement. The editors are not only experts in the history of the Stone-Campbell Movement but also well-known figures in its various branches, and they have recruited a remarkable panel of specialists to write these articles. The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement will surely be welcomed by research centers around the world and will find its way into school and church libraries all over. Furthermore, this reference work is a delightful to read, and it will no doubt be enjoyed by the many members of the Stone-Campbell Movement who have an interest in their religious heritage."Randall Balmer "Historians of American religion have long puzzled over the various and confusing congeries of the Stone-Campbell Movement. This remarkable volume provides an indispensable guide to understanding this important tradition."

About The Non-Canonical Gospels


This book brings together a collection of chapter length treatments on the most significant of the non-canonical gospels. A particular strength of the volume is that it draws upon the research of leading experts in the field and clearly and concisely communicates the most hotly contested issues surrounding each text. While a key function of each chapter is to make the current academic debates accessible to a wider audience, these treatments are not simply overviews or survey articles. They also present fresh perspectives on a number of points, and critically assess the most recent trends in scholarship. As such, they will provide an ideal entry point for advanced undergraduate courses and taught Masters programmes. The structure of the book is divided up in an easily useable format. There is an introduction which underscores the significance of the non-canonical texts both for the original readers and for contemporary audiences. This chapter by Keith Elliott also traces important moments in the reception of a number of these texts both in art and literature. Next follows the main sequence of chapters dealing with individual texts. Texts such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Peter, and the Gospel of Mary are treated first due to the impact they have had to varying degrees on Historical Jesus research. Other texts are grouped in various subgroups: the two infancy gospels follow each other, and the more fragmentary texts are also closely linked in the arrangement. The book presents one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date discussions of a range of texts that continue to be of interest to scholars and wider readers. The discussions should clarify a number of popular misconceptions and allow for a more informed debate. The scholars who contribute to this collection represent an eclectic range of views and theological outlooks. No attempt has been made to impose a prescribed perspective. Rather, the leading experts have been consulted to produce fresh and stimulating treatments. The book will include contributions from Andrew Gregory (Oxford), Christopher Tuckett (Cambridge), April DeConick (Rice), and Simon Gathercole (Aberdeen), among others.
