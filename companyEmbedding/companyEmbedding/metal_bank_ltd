1 This offer is valid for new or existing BancWest Investment Services, Inc. ("BWIS") customers, and is limited to one "Eligible Account" (as defined below) per customer.  The maximum cash bonus allowable for an Eligible Account is $2,500 within a six-month period.  "Qualifying Assets," for purposes of this offer, shall mean assets (i.e., cash, securities, fixed and variable annuities, and real estate investments trusts) deposited or transferred into the Eligible Account from outside BWIS or any BWIS affiliate within 60 days of enrollment, minus assets withdrawn or transferred out of Eligible Accounts within such 60-day period.  Life insurance holdings and other assets not listed above are not "Qualifying Assets" and are not eligible for this offer. Qualifying Assets will be valued at the time BWIS receives such assets.  An "Eligible Account" is a BWIS account that holds Qualifying Assets, and that has been enrolled to receive this offer prior to depositing or transferring any Qualifying Assets.  Eligible Accounts do not include any account the inclusion of which is prohibited by law or may result in a breach of any fiduciary duty, law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Customers with Qualifying Assets of $50,000-$74,999.99 may receive a bonus in the amount of $200; customers with Qualifying Assets of $75,000-$249,999.99 may receive $300; customers with Qualifying Assets of $250,000-$499,999.99 may receive $700; customers with Qualifying Assets of $500,000-$999,999.99 may receive $1,250; customers with Qualifying Assets of $1,000,000 or more, may receive $2,500. If all requirements for this offer are met, Qualifying Assets will be calculated as of the 60th day after enrollment and the cash bonus will be credited to the Eligible Account within six weeks. The minimum Qualifying Assets for the applicable bonus amount must be maintained in the Eligible Account for one year from the date on which BWIS receives such assets or BWIS may charge the account the amount of the bonus. Any applicable taxes associated with the cash bonus are the responsibility of the BWIS account holder. To the extent required by law, BWIS will report the total value of this bonus to the IRS on Form 1099-INT for the applicable tax year in which the bonus was paid. Customers should consult a tax professional to determine the appropriate tax treatment for this bonus offer.  Employees or associated persons of FINRA, any FINRA member firm (other than BWIS), or a U.S. exchange are not eligible for this offer. Employees, associated persons, and customers of First Hawaiian Bank and First Hawaiian Investment Services are not eligible for this offer.  Offer is non-transferrable and only valid in the United States. BWIS reserves the right to modify or cancel this offer at any time.  Void where prohibited.

 Eidsvold Project (100% MBK) – Au
The Eidsvold project (658km2) is centred on the historical Eidsvold goldfield (100,000 oz Au mined in the early 1900’s) within the Eidsvold intrusive complex, located between the Cracow (3 Moz Au) and Mt Rawdon (2 Moz Au) gold mines in the Northern New England Orogen (Figure 1).

Project location is shown in Figure 2 
Figure 1: Triumph and Eidsvold project locations SE Qld

Figure 2:  Topographic features in the Eidsvold project area presented on a Google™ Image. Datum: GDA94 The discovery of high grade gold mineralisation in 2014[1] including 1m @ 17.45g/t Au, 90g/t Ag, and 2.5% Cu as part of an intrusion related gold system confirms the Company’s exploration model and importantly opens up the potential of the entire Eidsvold intrusive complex (250km2) which is almost entirely concealed beneath sedimentary cover (Figure 1). Refer to Figure 3 showing the intrusion related gold systems model with the interpreted deposit styles targeted by MBK. [1] For further details regarding drilling results refer to the ASX Announcement regarding the Eidsvold Project dated 15 April 2014
 
Photo showing gold mineralised hydrothermal breccia at Mount Brady. The Eidsvold intrusive complex is virtually unexplored and Metal Bank has identified several high priority targets using regional airborne magnetics, and plans to fly detailed helimagnetics over the target areas. One of the Company’s key exploration tools is the use of airborne magnetics data to identify highly prospective zones of magnetite destructive alteration which are likely to be associated with the intrusion related gold mineralisation within the Eidsvold intrusive complex (Figure 4).

Competent Persons Statement The information in this document that relates to Exploration Results is based on information compiled or reviewed by Mr Tony Schreck, who is a Member of The Australasian Institute of Geoscientists. Mr Schreck is an employee of the Company. Mr Schreck has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves’. Mr Schreck consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it applies. The Exploration Targets described in this summary of projects are conceptual in nature and there is insufficient information to establish whether further exploration will result in the determination of Mineral Resources. Any resources referred to in this summary are not based on estimations of Ore Reserves or Mineral Resources made in accordance with the JORC Code and caution should be exercised in any external technical or economic evaluation.

 Mt Mackenzie Project (100% MBK) – Cu-Mo
The project lies approximately 40km north east of the Mt Carlton mining operation Au-Ag‑Cu (Evolution Mining), refer to Figure 1. The target for the project is porphyry style Cu-Mo-Au mineralisation associated with regional NW trending structures. A detailed review of the historical exploration data has identified several Cu‑Mo anomalies (no historical Au analysis) which have received limited previous follow-up and which represent priority targets for MBK.

 
 
The Mt Mackenzie project is located 40km NE of the Mt Carlton Au-Ag-Cu mining operation owned by Evolution Mining, an operation that produces approximately 85,000 gold equivalent ounces per year.
Compilation of historical ‘porphyry copper’ exploration data from the 1970’s covering the Mt Mackenzie Project has led to the recognition of a copper-molybdenum porphyry style mineral system which has never been sampled for gold or silver. The historical data defines coincident copper (to 1000ppm Cu) and molybdenum (to 105ppm Mo) soil anomalies associated with porphyry style mineralisation within an area of approximately 800m x 800m; the anomalies being open (Figure 1). Geological mapping over the soil anomalies completed as part of the historical exploration highlights broad areas of silica-sericite-pyrite alteration as part of the porphyry mineral system. Two shallow drill holes (<150m) completed in the 1970’s intersected intense alteration but did not explain the source of the copper and molybdenum soil anomalies.
 

Figure 1:  Left figure – 3D view of historical copper soils green contour 100ppm to 500ppm Cu, purple contour 500ppm to 1000ppm Cu. Right figure – 3D view of historical molybdenum soils (blue contour 10ppm to 30ppm Mo, red contour 30ppm to 105ppm Mo).
 
Many large porphyry style gold deposits in eastern Australia contain elevated copper and molybdenum with examples including the Mt Leyshon (3.5Moz Au) and Kidston (3.7Moz Au) deposits.
MBK is planning an initial exploration programme to assess the porphyry gold-copper-molybdenum potential.

Perth, Australia (ABN Newswire) - Metal Bank Limited (ASX:MBK) is pleased to provide the following drilling update from the Triumph Project in southeast Queensland, Australia. Results have been received from an initial diamond drilling programme (8 holes for 1012.5m) testing various Induced Polarisation (IP) geophysical targets under shallow cover. Highlights: - 20 meter outer zone of mineralised intense alteration consistent with a bulk tonnage Au-Cu-Mo system successfully intersected - Demonstrates bulk tonnage potential with at least nine new targets identified within a 4km x 2km corridor - New IP geophysics and diamond drilling lays the foundation for systematic testing of high-grade and bulk tonnage targets with follow up drilling imminent The results provide strong support for multiple bulk tonnage style mineral systems on the project, with the first hole into the Chief Adachi target returning strong Au-Ag-Mo-Bi geochemistry within intense feldspathic alteration typical of leakage above the 'roof zone' of a potentially much larger mineralised Au-Cu-Mo system concealed by shallow cover. Nine new Au-Cu-Mo bulk tonnage exploration targets have been defined; underpinned by the latest drilling, new IP geophysics and further supported by incorporation of existing geological, geochemical and geophysical evidence. Tony Schreck, Managing Director of Metal Bank said: "We now have direct evidence for a connection between the widespread high-grade Au-Ag mineralisation targeted to date and bulk tonnage Au-Cu-Mo style mineralisation of a potentially significant scale. This is a pivotal step change for the Triumph project and importantly, it provides the geological indication that the project can host large bulk tonnage systems similar to other multi-million ounce gold deposits of Eastern Australia."  Bulk Tonnage Style Au-Cu-Mo Mineralisation - Chief Adachi Prospect An initial diamond drill hole (TDH115) has been completed at the Chief Adachi prospect, the first of nine new bulk tonnage targets to be tested. Drilling was designed to test the margin of a broad >750m x 350m IP geophysical anomaly characterised by a low resistivity signature concealed beneath shallow cover sediments. The results included elevated levels of Mo-Cu-Pb-Zn-Mo-Ag-Bi (Au) geochemistry associated with intense feldspathic-sericite alteration which are consistent with leakage from a mineralised 'roof zone' or outer carapace located above an intrusion. An interpreted drill section across the geophysical target zone is shown in Figure 3 in link below.  The porous nature of the intense feldspathic alteration containing abundant sulfide-filled vuggy cavities including molybdenum (Mo), chalcopyrite (Cu) and sphalerite (Zn) (Figure 1 in link below) is also consistent with the low resistivity IP response (Figure 4 in link below) and occupies a previously unexplored area concealed beneath sedimentary cover. The priority at Chief Adachi target is to evaluate the entire IP low resistivity zone (>750m x 300m) interpreted to reflect similar widespread alteration and mineralisation (refer to Figure 4 in link below).  New Target Generation - IP Resistivity and Chargeability Geophysics Nine new Au-Cu-Mo bulk tonnage exploration targets (including Chief Adachi) have been defined, underpinned by the latest drilling, IP geophysics and further supported by incorporation of existing geological, geochemical and geophysical evidence (Figure 2 in link below). A conceptual exploration model of the Triumph intrusion-related mineralised system is shown in Figure 6 in link below with the section line shown in Figure 2. This 4km long section extends across the project area from New Constitution in the southwest to Bonneville in the northeast and highlights the link between the different styles of mineralised high-grade and bulk tonnage intrusion-related exploration targets at the Triumph Project. A number of distinctive IP geophysical signatures were calibrated from drill testing as part of this diamond drilling programme providing more robust geological interpretations and a significant improvement in the ability to target under shallow cover sediments.  Triumph Project - next phase The company's forward exploration strategy is to systematically explore these concealed new bulk tonnage targets for multi-million ounce potential in parallel with the continuation of testing for high-grade Au-Ag near surface mineralisation. Follow-up drilling is planned to commence in early July at Chief Adachi targeting the IP geophysics concealed by shallow cover. Further drilling is also planned to continue to evaluate the high-grade Au-Ag targets at Bald Hill, Handbrake Hill, Big Hans, and New Constitution prospects, the subject of previous drill programmes. The Triumph gold camp is an intrusion related gold system of the type encountered in a number of large systems in Queensland such as Kidston (3.7Moz Au), Mt Leyshon (3.5Moz Au), Ravenswood (3Moz Au) and Mt Wright (1.3Moz Au). Exploration to date by MBK has defined widespread high-grade Au-Ag mineralisation which appears as leakage around and above multiple intrusion related Au-Cu-Mo targets defined on the project.

The company's key projects are the Triumph, Eidsvold and Mt Mackenzie Gold Projects situated in the northern New England Fold Belt of central Queensland, which also hosts the Cracow (3Moz Au), Mt Rawdon (2Moz Au), Mt Morgan (8Moz Au, 0.4Mt Cu) and Gympie (5Moz Au) gold deposits. The company has an experienced Board and management team that brings regional knowledge, expertise in early stage exploration and development, relevant experience in the mid cap ASX-listed resource sector and a focus on sound corporate governance.

Metal Bank Ltd (ASX:MBK) has received more high grade gold results from the Triumph project, pointing to a possible intrusion related gold system of the type encountered in a number of large systems in southern Queensland.The shallow 9-hole reverse circulation program at the Bald Hill prospect returned a highlight result of 15 metres at 10.3 g/t gold, 76 g/t silver and 0.5% copper from 9 metres depth.Best of the others were 6 metres at 2.4 g/t gold and 15 metres at 1.6 g/t gold, both from 7 metres depth in two different holes.The silver and copper mineralisation also point to some potentially useful by-product credits.Previous exploration in the region was focused only on a small area centred on the historical Norton goldfield.Subsequent exploration by Metal Bank has now established strong evidence of an extensive, underexplored mineralised system extending over 15 square kilometres.It is also worth noting that the Triumph project is located between Evolution Mining Ltd’s (ASX:CAH) active Mt Rawdon mine (2 million ounces gold) and the historical Mt Morgan (8 million ounces gold).Metal Bank is chaired by Inés Scotland.Metal Bank had recently completed a capital raising of $564,500 to progress exploration on its east Australian projects.

1 This offer is valid for new or existing BancWest Investment Services, Inc. ("BWIS") customers, and is limited to one "Eligible Account" (as defined below) per customer.  The maximum cash bonus allowable for an Eligible Account is $2,500 within a six-month period.  "Qualifying Assets," for purposes of this offer, shall mean assets (i.e., cash, securities, fixed and variable annuities, and real estate investments trusts) deposited or transferred into the Eligible Account from outside BWIS or any BWIS affiliate within 60 days of enrollment, minus assets withdrawn or transferred out of Eligible Accounts within such 60-day period.  Life insurance holdings and other assets not listed above are not "Qualifying Assets" and are not eligible for this offer. Qualifying Assets will be valued at the time BWIS receives such assets.  An "Eligible Account" is a BWIS account that holds Qualifying Assets, and that has been enrolled to receive this offer prior to depositing or transferring any Qualifying Assets.  Eligible Accounts do not include any account the inclusion of which is prohibited by law or may result in a breach of any fiduciary duty, law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Customers with Qualifying Assets of $50,000-$74,999.99 may receive a bonus in the amount of $200; customers with Qualifying Assets of $75,000-$249,999.99 may receive $300; customers with Qualifying Assets of $250,000-$499,999.99 may receive $700; customers with Qualifying Assets of $500,000-$999,999.99 may receive $1,250; customers with Qualifying Assets of $1,000,000 or more, may receive $2,500. If all requirements for this offer are met, Qualifying Assets will be calculated as of the 60th day after enrollment and the cash bonus will be credited to the Eligible Account within six weeks. The minimum Qualifying Assets for the applicable bonus amount must be maintained in the Eligible Account for one year from the date on which BWIS receives such assets or BWIS may charge the account the amount of the bonus. Any applicable taxes associated with the cash bonus are the responsibility of the BWIS account holder. To the extent required by law, BWIS will report the total value of this bonus to the IRS on Form 1099-INT for the applicable tax year in which the bonus was paid. Customers should consult a tax professional to determine the appropriate tax treatment for this bonus offer.  Employees or associated persons of FINRA, any FINRA member firm (other than BWIS), or a U.S. exchange are not eligible for this offer. Employees, associated persons, and customers of First Hawaiian Bank and First Hawaiian Investment Services are not eligible for this offer.  Offer is non-transferrable and only valid in the United States. BWIS reserves the right to modify or cancel this offer at any time.  Void where prohibited.
Securities and variable annuities are offered through BancWest Investment Services, a registered broker/dealer, Member FINRA/SIPC, and an SEC-registered investment adviser. Financial Advisors are Registered Representatives of BancWest Investment Services.
