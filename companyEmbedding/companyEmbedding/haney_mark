Haney's 
					Appledale Farm is located in Nancy, Kentucky.  The farm has apple and peach orchards, 
					roadside market, and a pie shop.  
					It is currently owned by brothers Mark and Don Haney.

The farm 
					itself dates back to the late 1800s.  It has been 
					passed down through five generations, the 
					latest being Don and Mark. The two brothers 
					were raised on the farm and learned first-hand experience 
					from their late father, previous owner Lawrence Haney.
					 




 

Many often ask 
					where the name "Appledale" comes from.  In the early 
					1900s, Lawrence's grandfather, Floyd Wilson, ran an apple and corn farm 
					under the name "Cloverdale".  However, due to 
					health reasons, he moved to Somerset, and 
					Lawrence and his wife, Oreida, inherited the farm in 1944.

									and Ann Haney, Oreida Haney, Mark and 
									Marlene Haney






Lawrence and Oreida, 
								at the ages of 19 and 22, respectively, moved to 
								the apple farm with very little apple-growing 
								experience.  However, they soon began the 
								business as it is known today, especially when 
								it comes to the name.




 
					

Seeing that 
					the name "Cloverdale" did not really suit their business, 
					Oreida decided to change the name of the apple farm to "Appledale", 
					retaining part of its history.  Haney's Appledale Farm has been 
					in operation ever since.
					

					 











					 




 





Today, Haney's 
					farm sprawls more than 450 acres in South Central Kentucky.  
					The family grows apples over 
25 varieties of apples, ten varieties of peaches, 
					pears, and nectarines on more than 70 acres.  

 

Haney's is 
					still very much a family business, with family members 
					coming in to work at the farm almost every weekend in the 
					fall, its busiest season.  However, there is always 
					something happening at the farm.  Whether it be apples 
					in the fall, peaches in the summer, or pies all year, you're 
					sure to have a great experience every time you come.

					 

The family invites you to 
					visit them!

Jury awards $33.8 million to Fort Worth man who fell through skylight

                            FORT WORTH 
                        


In 2010, maintenance man Steven Landers was working on the roof of a Williamson-Dickie building on Blue Mound Road when he fell headfirst through an acrylic plastic skylight. 
He landed 35 feet below on a concrete floor.
His broken right leg was eventually amputated; his back, some ribs and his left arm were broken; and a lung was punctured.
Landers’ lawsuit against the skylight manufacturer, Wasco Products of Wells, Maine, went to trial March 23 in 48th state District Court. His attorneys asked the Tarrant County jury for a $15 million judgment. 


On April 2, jurors awarded Landers $33.8 million. A final judgment in the case is pending.




“I think it was a fair decision,” Landers said. “The jury worked hard to reach their decision.”
Wasco CEO Jeff Frank told the Star-Telegram that Wasco offers its customers appropriate fall protection screens and takes safety very seriously, but “responsibility for skylight safety does not rest with Wasco alone. Owners and installers must provide the ultimate protections to assure skylight safety for those who work near and around installed skylights, and that apparently failed to occur in this case.”
“All Wasco personnel are saddened by the accident,” Frank said in an email.
Landers, 31, is married with four children.  On Sept. 18, 2010, he was replacing a venting motor on the roof when he squatted to pick up tools, lost his balance and put his hand on the skylight to steady himself. Instead, he fell through, said Mark Haney, Landers’ attorney.
Despite the loss of his right leg below the knee and a bad back, Landers returned to work after 14 months.



“Once I got my prosthetic, I could walk and came back to work,” Landers said.
Initially, Landers sued Wasco, Anchor Roofing and Williamson-Dickie. Anchor Roofing settled out of court, and Williamson-Dickie was dropped from the suit early on. 
Haney said Friday that he believes Williamson-Dickie was never aware of the potential danger.

Steven Landers sits with one of his children, Colton, 2, at his Fort Worth home on Friday, April 3, 2015. A jury awarded Landers $35 million this week for the injuries he sustained when he fell through a skylight as he worked on a roof in 2010.

Adrienne is in her 12th year of selling real estate in the Sacramento area.   Born and raised in the Bay Area she went in search of an area that could bring quality of life and affordability.  Having settled in Folsom in 2000 she fell in love with all this community and surrounding areas offer.  It was through this love Adrienne chose to commit to helping others dreams come true – living the American Dream in the Sacramento area. 
The last 12 years of real estate has consisted of and incredible surge in the market followed by  the mortgage and housing crisis where short sales and foreclosures became the norm.  Adrienne successfully guided her clients through the emotional and economic elements of the real estate buying and selling process with expertise, commitment, and care.  Adrienne’s goal has been to have her client’s walk away insisting that their friends and family utilize her to assist in their real estate needs and she has accomplished just that. 
Adrienne continues to live in Folsom with her three children and is excited to be a part of the Haney Garcia team as they prepare to open their new office at the Palladio this spring.

I have a real passion for Real Estate. I love what I do! I have lived in the Greater Sacramento area my entire life and have 5 years of experience in Property Management where I was the lead leasing agent of 200 properties. Over the years, I have excelled in customer service, organization skills and communication.

I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise about buying and selling real estate. I can work with you to find the right home at the right price for you, including all the neighborhood amenities that matter - not to mention the essential criteria you have for your ideal home.
When it's time to move, you need someone who will advertise your home, show to prospective buyers, negotiate the purchase contract, arrange financing, oversee the inspections, handle all necessary paperwork and supervise the closing. I can take care of everything you need, from start to close.
Oftentimes buyers don't visualize living in your home the way you do. I can make your home attractive to its ideal audience - which can help you get top dollar. Things like staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls can be the difference between a home resting on the market and one that's sold fast.My love for our military service members inspired me to obtain my Military Relocation Professional Certification.

There is many time requirements and disclosures that a professional is experienced in to protect yourself and your investment from future concerns. Even if you don't use me to be your Agent, use a certified Realtor. You will be happier, less stressed and make more money if you do..

I am so impressed with Erica's performance during my experience of purchasing a home.

She even helped us tie up some loose ends after the closing. I would highly recommend Erica to be your agent. -Mary McCormick
 
Erica was fantastic in helping me sell my mothers home. Her expertise and knowledge of listing, and selling the home was a big relief. Very professional and quick. It was comforting to have Erica as someone you can trust and will take care of any needs that arise and keep you up to date. I would definitely recommend her to take care of your real estate needs.

Erica really went above and beyond during the recent purchase of my new home. This process can be stressful , but she made it so seamless and exciting. I appreciate how she stayed ahead of the game and kept me informed of everything going on. Through her hard work, I found an amazing home and she walked me though every step.

About Me:
I was born and raised near Sacramento, CA to a loving mother and father.  At the age of 3 I was introduced to my beautiful baby sister who I love very much.  After high school I decided to continue my education at the local community college.  While doing so, I started working in the food service industry where I worked my way up to bartender. 
After completing my general education and working several years at the same job, I decided I wanted some change in my life.  I made the decision to move to Maui in 2010.  It was the best decision I ever made, as it helped me to grow and become the independent woman I am today.  I spent 2 years on the island and after a few unfortunate events, I decided it was time to move back to California to be closer to family and go back to school. 
Once I moved back it felt like I had woke from the best dream ever.  Living in Hawaii changed me for the better.  It helped me to see the bigger picture in life, which is to be happy, to love and be loved.  I decided I wanted to study Nutrition.  Living a healthy, active lifestyle has always been important to me, and educating myself on how to do so made learning fun.  I completed all the courses available and then had to decide what would be next. 
During this time I was entertained by the fact of obtaining my real estate license.  I quickly made the decision to apply for online schooling.  Several months later I completed the course.  I studied diligently and passed my state exam the first time.  Schooling didn’t prepare me for the real world of being my own boss and making my own schedule, but now, several years later here I am loving what I do and couldn’t be happier with the career I have chosen!
My Promise to You:
I will not only provide great service to those seeking my help in buying or selling a home, but I offer honesty, integrity and diligence throughout the transaction.  My goal is to make your dreams come true when it comes to finding the perfect home or getting your current home sold for top dollar.  I can help you start along the path of obtaining a pre-approval for lending, explain the difference between lenders, and why certain lenders make your home offers stronger than other buyers.  I will dedicate my time to getting your real estate needs met.  All I ask for in return is your promise to keep an open mind throughout this process while we work as a team.  If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to let me know.  I look forward to assisting you in this exciting journey!

 I have spent my entire life in the service industry in one facet or another. For the last 13 years I have enjoyed the gaming industry, and the many challenges it had to offer. Before that , I worked with my staff in a leadership capacity. It's always been gratifying for me to help others achieve. And it's no different in the real estate industry. As a Realtor, I have the privilege to help 1st time home buyers find their dream home. I also help owners upgrade their lifestyle by purchasing larger homes as their lives flourish. I also get to help others by providing a smooth professional sale of their home so that they can enjoy the fruits of their labor.
 Not all markets are the same, so it's very important to find an expert who knows the area. This is where I can help. All it takes is a quick phone call, and we can be viewing homes or discussing selling within days. Allow me to exhibit how my skills can help you today.
