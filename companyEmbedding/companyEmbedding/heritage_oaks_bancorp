Heritage Oaks Bancorp Reports First Quarter Results






GlobeNewswire



Apr 28, 2016 4:10 PM EDT













 




























































 PASO ROBLES, Calif., April 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heritage Oaks Bancorp ("Heritage Oaks" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:HEOP), a bank holding company and parent of Heritage Oaks Bank (the "Bank"), reported net income available to common shareholders of $4.0 million, or $0.12 per dilutive common share, for the first quarter of 2016 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $4.1 million, or $0.12 per dilutive common share, for the first quarter of 2015, and net income available to common shareholders of $3.5 million, or $0.10 per dilutive common share for the fourth quarter of 2015.  First Quarter 2016 Highlights  Gross loans increased by $84.0 million, or 7.0%, to $1.29 billion at March 31, 2016 compared to $1.21 billion at March 31, 2015, and by $44.1 million or 3.5% compared to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2015.  New loan production totaled $117.2 million for the first quarter of 2016.  Loan production increased by 4% compared to the linked quarter.  Total deposits increased by $122.3 million, or 8.4% to $1.58 billion at March 31, 2016 compared with $1.46 billion a year earlier, and by $17.6 million, or 1.1% during the first quarter of 2016.  Non-interest bearing demand deposits grew by 8.2% during the last year and by 1.8% over the last quarter to $524.0 million, and represent 33.1% of total deposits at March 31, 2016.  The allowance for loan and lease losses ("ALLL") as a percentage of gross loans declined from 1.40% at March 31, 2015 to 1.36% at March 31, 2016.  Credit quality remains strong with non-accrual loans representing 0.63% of total gross loans at March 31, 2016, unchanged from the linked quarter, and down from 0.98% at March 31, 2015.  Net recoveries for the first quarter of 2016 were flat compared to the prior quarter at $0.1 million.  Loans delinquent 30 to 89 days declined to $32 thousand at March 31, 2016. There was no provision for loan losses recorded in the first quarter due to relative stability in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.  Regulatory capital ratios for the Bank at March 31, 2016 were 9.13% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital, 13.05% for Total Risk Based Capital, and 11.80% for Common Equity Tier One Capital to Total Risk Based Capital.    On April 27th, 2016 the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.06 per common share for shareholders of record as of May 18th, 2016, which is payable to our common shareholders on May 31, 2016.  "We achieved strong loan growth during the first quarter of 2016 which was supported by our new customer interest rate swap product offering," stated Simone Lagomarsino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Heritage Oaks Bancorp.  Ms. Lagomarsino continued, "The swap product allows us to offer the long term fixed rate loans that our customers desire, while supporting a better interest rate risk profile for the Bank by converting the loan to a fully variable rate asset on our balance sheet. In addition, the swap product generated over $500 thousand in non-interest income during the first quarter, and we are confident that our customers' interest in this product will continue.  We were also successful in our efforts to optimize our asset mix profile by increasing our loan to deposit ratio by nearly 2.00% during the first quarter.  This should help stabilize our net interest margin going forward, given the low interest rate environment."

Heritage Oaks Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter Results






GlobeNewswire



Jan 30, 2017 4:05 PM EST













 


















































 PASO ROBLES, Calif., Jan. 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heritage Oaks Bancorp ("Heritage Oaks" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:HEOP), a bank holding company and parent of Heritage Oaks Bank (the "Bank"), reported net income available to common shareholders of $4.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $3.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2015, and net income available to common shareholders of $4.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income available to common shareholders was $16.9 million, or $0.49 per diluted common share compared with net income available to common shareholders of $15.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2015.   Fourth Quarter and Year End 2016 Highlights  Gross loans increased by $138.2 million, or 11.1%, to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to $1.25 billion a year earlier, and increased by $42.8 million, or 3.2%, compared to $1.34 billion at September 30, 2016.  New loan production totaled $124.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 10.3% compared to the linked quarter.  Total deposits increased by $118.9 million, or 7.6%, to $1.68 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with $1.56 billion a year earlier, and increased by $52.5 million, or 3.2%, during the fourth quarter of 2016.  Non-interest bearing demand deposits grew by 11.5% during the last year and by 0.7% over the last quarter to $574.0 million, and represent 34.1% of total deposits at December 31, 2016.  Credit quality remains strong with non-accrual loans representing 0.49% of total gross loans at December 31, 2016, down from 0.63% a year ago, and up from 0.36% for the linked quarter.  Net recoveries for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million for the linked quarter and $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.  Loans delinquent 30 to 89 days as a percentage of gross loans increased to 0.02% from 0.00% for the linked quarter, and remained the same relative to 0.02% at December 31, 2015.    Regulatory capital ratios for the Bank at December 31, 2016 were 9.47% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital, 13.35% for Total Risk Based Capital, and 12.19% for Common Equity Tier One Capital.    On January 25th, 2017 the Company's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.06 per common share for shareholders of record as of February 15th, 2017, which is payable to our common shareholders on February 28th, 2017.  As previously announced, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:PPBI) for an aggregate purchase price of $405.6 million, or $11.68 per share based on the closing price for Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.'s common stock of $33.65 as of December 12, 2016. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, upon consummation of the transaction, holders of Heritage Oaks Bancorp common stock will have the right to receive 0.3471 shares of Pacific Premier common stock for each share of Heritage Oaks common stock they own. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. This acquisition will provide the Company's customers with an expanded product set and services and Heritage Oaks Bank customers will continue to receive the same excellent customer service.  The acquisition also increases the combined entity's geographic footprint to cover the coast of California from San Diego to Paso Robles.  "2016 marked a year of multiple successes for the Company, which should provide many long-term benefits for its shareholders, customers, and employees," stated Simone Lagomarsino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Heritage Oaks Bancorp.  "We achieved double-digit growth in loans and non-interest bearing demand deposits during 2016, and we also introduced our new interest rate swap product, which generated over $1.2 million in fee income.  We successfully terminated the Bank Secrecy Act Consent Order, which should result in lower costs and improve our efficiency going forward.  Finally, we announced our strategic merger with Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., which we believe will create a more attractive commercial banking franchise.  Once the two organizations are combined we will offer a broader array of products and services, increased lending capacity, and an expanded geographic footprint.  All of this should position us to better serve our customers and provide stronger returns to our shareholders," stated Ms. Lagomarsino.
