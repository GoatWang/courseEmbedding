Drake Jared Parker is a main character on Drake & Josh. He lives with his step-brother, Josh Nichols. He is portrayed by Drake Bell.


Personality and Traits
Drake's most common personality is his laziness. However, he does show interest in playing the guitar and dating girls. Drake does not do well in school unlike Josh, and almost fails the 11th grade due to his laziness at showing up for gym class. Drake is known to say nonsensical things throughout season 3 and 4, which is why Josh tends to reply to him with sarcastic comments. Drake is not a very smart person and has been known to have the intelligence of a 2nd grader unlike Josh and his sister, Megan. Drake has a tendency to get Josh in trouble with the things he does. Drake is not a strong or tough person as he was beaten up by his ex-girlfriend, Lucy and has been carried by Josh countless times.
Drake doesn't use his common sense most of the time and doesn't mind failing school, despite all this Drake is known to have better luck than Josh. Drake also happens to be more successful with girls as he has had many ex-girlfriends and is also credited to be the best kisser by his current girlfriend, Carly and his ex-girlfriends, Lucy and Christine. Drake has a bad habit of lying to people often his mother Audrey, the victim of it, which is why she prefers to trust Josh rather than Drake sometimes. And while is a player when it comes to dating, he doesn't appear to be one to cheat on the girl he is currently dating.

Family
Audrey Parker
     
Audrey is Drake's biological mother. She is the only person in the family who can discipline Drake, and many times telling him he can't go to a certain place, although Drake chooses to lie and disobey her it always ends up with her grounding him. Audrey is also to known to be a good persuader often compelling Drake to go do something against his will including to go for counseling sessions. Audrey is also completely cool with the fact that Drake dates many different girls and in certain episodes she can be seen openly conversing with Drake's band mates and ex-girlfriends. Audrey does tend to show at times that she does love Drake.

Megan Parker
     
Megan is Drake's little sister who also appears to be very evil. Megan loves to make Drake and Josh's life miserable with her pranks. Megan also thinks that the girls that Drake dates are stupid. Megan has also been known to call Drake a "boob".

Relationships with Other Characters
Josh Nichols
Drake shares a complicated relationship with Josh often arguing and fighting happens between them, but in the end they stick to each other no matter what situation they're in.

Mindy Crenshaw
Mindy is one of Drake's enemies, although the two have softened up ever since Mindy started dating Josh. Drake and Mindy often tease and make fun of each other, although Mindy does help Drake with his girlfriend problems sometimes. Mindy has also been known to enjoy Drake's music as she shows up at his concerts and can be seen dancing at times.

Trivia
 Drake is known to be short for his age as can be seen throughout season 4, he is only as tall as his mother, Audrey.
 He has had many girlfriends.
 He is not very smart and often gets into trouble because of his habit of not using common sense.

 He has a mother named Audrey.
 He is often the victim of being touched in private areas of his body by Josh.
 He fails at school.
 He constantly lies to Audrey.
 His hair style changes every season, in season 1 he had spiky hair, in season 2 he had a bowl cut, in season 3 he had a longer version of the bowl cut that resembled a coconut and in season 4 he had a shorter version of the bowl cut with just little hair at the back part of his head cut off.
 He shares many similarities or traits with Audrey.
 His mother Audrey was 19 years old when she gave birth to him.
 He is often the victim of being groped by his brother, Josh.
 According to Josh, Drake has a birthmark on his back, which he thinks looks like a giraffe raking leaves, however Josh disagrees with this.

Whether you're interested in a new gaming platform or you're looking to try out some different games, our selection of video games, accessories and consoles has all the most important titles and models that gamers look for. From Nintendo and Xbox to Madden and the Sims, we have all the big names you're looking for, plus some more unusual titles you may find interesting enough to try. Thanks to our Every Day Low Prices, you'll get to stock up on the video games, consoles and accessories you need to make your entertainment collection complete.Shop by platform or consoleIf you're the kind of gamer who's loyal to a specific gaming platform or console, you'll find it easy to browse through this category and uncover new games or find the hardware you need to bring your games to life. PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Nintendo 3DS are all examples of the major gaming consoles and platforms we cover in this video games section. Because some game companies don't release their titles across all platforms, it can be helpful to shop by platform or console as you look for new games so you can filter out titles that aren't available for what you have. This way, you can have an efficient shopping experience and avoid the disappointment of finding a title you really like and then realizing it isn't available for your specific console.Save with bundlesEven with the rise of digital gaming, being a serious gamer usually means acquiring a lot of different components and peripherals. Plus, some consoles don't fully support digital gaming, meaning physical copies of games in disc and card formats are still prevalent in this product category. Walmart's gaming bundles are a quick way to get a great deal on several different video gaming elements at once. Bundles may include both digital and physical media games along with accessories such as specialty controllers needed for a specific type of gameplay. You can also find starter bundles that package essential elements like consoles, basic controllers, specialty controllers and memory cards so you can get everything you need to get started playing new favorite games right out of the box. These bundles offer a great way to give a complete, thoughtful gift to someone who loves video games, but you can also get them for your own use at home.Browse popular game franchisesPlaying the latest installment in a major gaming franchise like Madden, Grand Theft Auto or Final Fantasy makes it easy to get hooked on the story, style and general concept behind the game. Players who experience these video games are often left wanting more from the same franchise. If you're looking to dive deeper into your favorite video game's backstory, you can browse by game franchise to see what you can find. This is also a great way to discover new game expansion packs and installments for a title you're already playing. Franchises like the Sims and Minecraft are particularly suitable options for this kind of add-on browsing. You could end up finding new ways to play the game you currently own by introducing new expansion packs to your existing setup. Discover new and old options for playing your favorite franchise titles, and stay on top of your preferred virtual worlds by periodically browsing to see what's new.Digital Gaming OptionsPhysical media is on its way out in many ways, and while many gamers still prefer to get physical copies of their favorite video games, many opt to download digital versions as well as a safeguard. Whether you're going digital-only or you want a digitized backup for your physical video gaming media, Walmart's digital gaming section is the ideal destination. Focusing on this section of our video games category allows you to zero in on games that come in a digital format. Some of our product listings are for the physical version of the game only, so if you want to be sure to get your digital copy, head to this section. Digital video games may be available via email delivery so you can instantly start playing, but if you want a physical container with a digital code inside to give as a gift, you may also find options to suit that need in this section. Our digital gaming options also include gift cards for in-game purchases, which make fantastic gifts as well.Stay current with preorders and new releasesWhether you love multiplayer games that are fun for parties or you prefer an immersive single-player roleplaying experience, you'll want to stay current on the upcoming slate of video games so you can always have the latest entertainment available. Walmart's video games section includes new releases that have just hit the market so you can stock up on the latest and greatest titles. We also have plenty of preorder titles available, allowing you to get in line and sign up to receive some of the most hotly anticipated video games on the current schedule for release. These new release and preorder titles are a big part of every avid gamer's life, and we make it easy to get in on the latest trends in video games without a lot of extra effort.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349563, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-Electronics, Cars, Fashion, Collectibles, Coupons and More | eBay Skip to main contenteBayShop by categoryShop by categoryEnter your search keywordAll CategoriesAdvancedHi (Sign in to bid or buy) Daily Deals Gift Cards Help & Contact Sell My eBayExpand My eBay Summary Bids/Offers Watch list Wish list All lists Purchase history Selling My Collections Followed searches MessagesNotification   HomeFollowingMotorsExpand: MotorsParts & AccessoriesParts & AccessoriesCars & Truck PartsMotorcycle PartsAutomotive Tools & SuppliesSales & EventsMotors DealsVehiclesVehiclesCars & TrucksMotorcyclesClassics & ExoticsPowersportsRVs & Other VehiclesMotors BlogFashionExpand: FashionTop CategoriesWomen's ClothingWomen's ShoesMen's ClothingMen's ShoesHandbags & AccessoriesLuxury HandbagsKids & BabyAdditional CategoriesJewelryWatchesBeautyHealthFashion DealsSales & EventsPre-owned FashionElectronicsExpand: ElectronicsTop CategoriesCell Phones & AccessoriesCameras & PhotoComputers & TabletsTV & Home TheaterVideo Games & ConsolesSmart HomeCamera DronesAdditional CategoriesiPhoneNintendo SwitchPortable AudioCar Audio, Video & GPSElectronics DealsSell Your PhonePre-owned ElectronicsCollectibles & ArtExpand: Collectibles & ArtTop CategoriesCollectiblesCoins & Paper MoneyBullion CenterSports Cards, Memorabilia & ApparelAntiquesComicsLive AuctionsAdditional CategorieseBay CollectiveFeatured Sales & EventsArtEntertainment MemorabiliaMilitariaKnives, Swords & BladesSotheby's on eBayHome & GardenExpand: Home & GardenTop CategoriesFurnitureHome DécorKitchen & DiningHousekeeping & OrganizationBabyeBay CollectiveWineAdditional CategoriesMajor AppliancesGenerators Outdoor Power EquipmentPower ToolsHome ImprovementTool StoragePetsSporting GoodsExpand: Sporting GoodsTop CategoriesGolfCyclingFishingHuntingTeam SportsFitness & RunningSales & EventsAdditional CategoriesCamping EquipmentBaseball & SoftballGolf Clothing, Shoes & AccessoriesArcheryFitness EquipmentWater SportsPre-owned Sports GearToysExpand: ToysTop CategoriesAction FiguresBoard & Traditional GamesDiecast ToysDrones & RC VehiclesLEGO & Building ToysModel Railroads & TrainsPreschool & Pretend PlayAdditional CategoriesFeatured Toy DealsBarbie Dolls & Teddy BearsDart Guns, Ride-Ons & Outdoor StructuresModels & KitsStuffed AnimalsTrading Card GamesFeatured Toy EventsBusiness & IndustrialExpand: Business & IndustrialTop CategoriesElectrical & Test EquipmentHealthcare, Lab & Life ScienceHeavy EquipmentManufacturing & MetalworkingMRO & Industrial SupplyRestaurant & CateringAdditional CategoriesOfficePacking & ShippingRetail & ServicesLight Equipment & ToolsHeavy Equipment AttachmentsHeavy Equipment Parts & AccessoriesMusicExpand: MusicTop CategoriesGuitarsPro-AudioVinyl, CDs, & MoreOrchestra & BandDrumsDJConcert TicketsAdditional CategoriesElectric GuitarsAcoustic GuitarsBassAmpsEffects & PedalsGuitar PartsPre-owned Musical InstrumentsDealsExpand: DealsTop CategoriesDaily DealsElectronic DealsFashion DealsH&G DealsGift Card DealsCollectibles & ArtAdditional CategoriesSporting Goods DealsMotors DealsTravel DealsMusical Instrument DealsShop All DealsPre-owned PicksMore Expand: MoreMotorsFashionElectronicsCollectibles & ArtHome & GardenSporting GoodsToysBusiness & IndustrialMusicDealsCarousel showing banner 1 of 4Play Banner CarouselPause Banner CarouseleBay Exclusive: Professor Einstein Is HereA personal robot and a $50 eBay gift card—only $249.99.Get Yours Now Get Yours Now Limited collector’s edition.Free Shipping on Every Deal, Every DayPlus, we’ll match the price of our competition.Shop Deals Shop Deals The Best Dorm?

TVDrake & Josh's Josh Peck got married — and Drake Bell wasn't there
Nivea Serrao•@NiveaSerraoPosted on June 19, 2017 at 12:31pm EDT

Hug me brotha! Drake & Josh star Josh Peck married his longtime girlfriend Paige O’Brien over the weekend.
The couple tied the knot during in Malibu, California, where they were joined by friends and family, including of Peck’s Grandfathered costars John Stamos (Peck’s dad on the 2015 Fox sitcom) and Nicole Golfieri, the mother of 4-year-old twins Layla and Emelia (Peck’s daughter on the show).
One person who was not in attendance (and none too pleased by that) was Peck’s former Drake & Josh costar Drake Bell.
The actor tweeted his displeasure, saying, “When you’re not invited to the wedding the message is clear….” He continued: “Loyalty is key… ALWAYS remember where you came from.”
Bell has since deleted the tweets.
See photos from the wedding below:





 Congrats to two of our favorite people. Josh & Paige, we love you ❤️❤️ #couplegoals

Drake & Josh ran on Nickelodeon from 2004-2007 and starred both Bell and Peck as stepbrothers who had to move in and share a room together after their parents fell in love and got married. As they got into episodic shenanigans, they also had to contend with their younger sister Megan (iCarly‘s Miranda Cosgrove).

Term:

                            The recovery room nurse is admitting a patient from the OR following the patient’s successful splenectomy. What is the first assessment that the nurse should perform on this newly admitted patient?

A) Heart rate and rhythm

B) Skin integrity

C) Core body temperature

D) Airway patency
                    
Definition:

                            Ans: D
Feedback:
The primary objective in the immediate postoperative period is to maintain ventilation and, thus, prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Both can occur if the airway is obstructed and ventilation is reduced. This assessment is followed by cardiovascular status and the condition of the surgical site. The core temperature would be assessed after the airway, cardiovascular status, and wound (skin integrity).
