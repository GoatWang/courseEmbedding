P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.80      Net Money Flow ()  350,838    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

AllianzGI Diversified Income & Convertible Fund Reports Results For The Fiscal Quarter Ended April 30, 2017






Business Wire




Jun 29, 2017 4:00 PM EDT













 




























































  AllianzGI Diversified Income & Convertible Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: ACV), a diversified closed-end management investment company which provides total return through a combination of current income and capital appreciation, while seeking to provide downside protection against capital loss, today announced its results for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017.                                                 At April 30,                      2017          2016         Net Assets (a)         $226,764,968         $206,890,564         Common Shares Outstanding         10,274,970         10,275,119         Net Asset Value ("NAV")         $22.07         $20.14         Market Price         $20.69         $17.81         Discount to NAV         (6.25)%         (11.57)%         Undistributed (Overdistributed) Ordinary                         Income Per Common Share (b)         $0.3220         $(0.1901)                                                                         Quarter ended April 30,                      2017          2016         Net Investment Income (c)         $1,091,128         $1,036,900         Per Share (c)         $0.11         $0.10     (d)     Net Realized and Change in Unrealized Gain (c)         $8,972,552         $15,971,286         Per Share (c)         $0.87         $1.55              (a)        Net assets are inclusive of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares of $30 million.                      (b)      Since the Fund's net earning rates fluctuate from month to month, there will be periods when the Fund may over-earn or under-earn its monthly dividend rate. This fluctuation will have the effect of adding to or subtracting from the Fund's undistributed (overdistributed) ordinary income balance. Fund management analyzes the current and projected net earning rates prior to recommending dividend amounts to the Fund's Board of Trustees for declaration. There can be no assurance that the monthly dividend rate will remain at its current level or that the undistributed (overdistributed) ordinary income balance, if any, will be sufficient to cover any shortfall in earnings to meet the current dividend rate. The undistributed (overdistributed) ordinary income balance is exclusive of market premium amortization on corporate bonds in accordance with federal income tax treatment. The undistributed (overdistributed) ordinary income balance includes realized gain (loss) on the sale of contingent debt and Section 305 sales adjustments for accrual of deemed dividends from investments in convertible debt, in accordance with federal income tax treatment.                    (c)      Net Investment Income for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017 includes market premium amortization on corporate bonds of $114,794 ($0.01 per common share). Net Investment Income for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016 includes market premium amortization on corporate bonds of $166,853 ($0.02 per common share). For tax purposes, the Fund has elected not to amortize market premium on corporate bonds.                    (d)      Calculated on average common shares outstanding.      Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Asset Management of America L.P., serves as the Fund's investment manager and is a member of Munich-based Allianz Group.
