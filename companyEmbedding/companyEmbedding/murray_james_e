Description





Product Description
Words by James Murray:
In the spring of 2014 my wife and I stayed at a remote log cabin in the Black Mountains. Anne was taken ill from the moment we arrived and barely left the bed all week. I’d packed a laptop, small midi keyboard and portable hard disc recorder, and resolved that if we weren’t to have a break together I’d at least salvage something from the trip.
I’d spent a lot of time around then thinking about how haunted we are by our lost loved and not-so-loved ones. About how these ghosts can be more than just absences, that they can actually exist in some real sense as shadows cast by our fears and regrets. The horse-whisperer who owns the cabin told us when we arrived of the local belief that up in those mountains the veil between this world and the next is at its thinnest. From the first nightfall to the very end of our stay I felt like the atmosphere in that place was charged, agitated somehow, like everything was on the verge of cracking.
Pines groaned in the woods all around us, walls and floorboards continually creaked and china rattled on the shelves. I recorded everything that made a sound, then manipulated and distressed those recordings, letting them bleed into one another, forming their own shifting rhythms and gritty, grainy textures. I added deep sub-bass sines, electronic washes and gently improvised motifs that felt in step with the strangely watchful energy of the place. Between the crackling of the open fire and the wild, wide landscape outside, I seemed to have stumbled into the perfect environment for exploring these unsettled yet tenderly nostalgic feelings I’d been having. The music flowed.
And now – thanks to Gosia Lapsa-Malawska‘s wonderfully plaintive artwork and Ian Hawgood‘s passion, belief and commitment – here is Killing Ghosts, my attempt to make some sense not just of that peculiar time, but of each and every day spent without those we leave behind.
Words by Ian Hawgood:
We came across the work of James Murray through his excellent Slowcraft Records label. In 2012 he released what was to become a bit of a seminal work that year in the highly praised Floods. He has since released superb records on a number of friends’ labels such as Hibernate, Eilean, VoxxoV, as well as a recent return to the Ultimae label.
I’ve personally known James for a number of years now after meeting at various shows around London, and we have talked and come very close to releasing music together over the years. As with all things where patience and honesty are involved, it has taken us to this point to finally bring something together that we are so thrilled to present now to you.
James’ work typically blurs the line between deep electronics and textured ambience. Yet in Killing Ghosts, James presents a truly perfect melding of exquisite sub-bass melodies under the surface of playful tones and fractured rhythms. The album itself has a feel of slow change and evolution as it journeys from the melodiously open electronica of ‘Footsteps’ and slowly down the rabbit hole as it waves us out with tracks such as ‘Allways’ and ‘Living Ghosts’.
The work embodies everything that is great about the work of this enormously talented artist as beyond its catchy entrance points, it is possibly one of the best examples of pure sound design we have been fortunate enough to release to date. Such a combination of melody and careful design takes a huge amount of skill, care, and patience, and we are so happy we have finally been able to all come together to release what is quite simply a genuine highlight in our eight years of existence as a label.

Description





Product Description
Eyes to the Height is British composer James Murray‘s full return to Ultimae Records, a tender and intimate ten chapter story reflecting the fragile beauty of life and loss, memory and function.
Delicate rhythms, blurred atmospherics and crystalline melodies gleam and glisten on the many facets of this modern ambient gem. This is a considered, heartfelt collection of sonic poetry from one of electronica’s most unusual voices – entrusted and dedicated to ears and hearts in this world and beyond.
James Murray’s seventh solo album follows the recent release of the Ghostwalk EP, featuring remixes by Martin Nonstatic and Kinosura.
 Heads held high
To the end of our days
On old sunken paths
Passing hollowed out ways
 Waves all recede
Light must speed away
While the hairs one by one
Turn from black into grey
 James Murray, 2016
Eyes to the Height (24bit) by JAMES MURRAY

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.
