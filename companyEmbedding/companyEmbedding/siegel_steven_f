VSL | Stephen F. Siegel




       
       
      
       
       
      









I am an associate professor in
		       the Department
		       of Computer and Information Sciences at
		       the University of
		       Delaware.  I also hold a joint appointment
		       in
		       the Department
		       of Mathematical Sciences.
		

		  My current research interests include (1) formal
		  methods for software verification, (2) parallel and
		  scientific computing (especially with MPI), and (3)
		  applications of (1) to (2).  As a recovering
		  mathematician (having worked in the cohomology and
		  representation theory of finite groups), I am always
		  looking for new applications of mathematics and
		  logic to problems in computer science.
		

		  I direct the Verified Software
		    Laboratory, which conducts research and develops
		  tools targeting the problems above.   The 
		  Toolkit for Accurate
		  Scientific Software (TASS), a verifier for C/MPI
		  programs, is our flagship product.  Our software,
		  publications, and experimental artifacts are all
		  available on the VSL web page.

Highlights


		  Aug 2014: The VSL has received a grant from the
		  U.S. Dept. of Energy to research the application of
		  verification techniques to scientific/numerical
		  programs.  We are looking for Ph.D. students to work
		  on this project as research assistants.  Background
		  in logic, model checking, or static
		  analysis is a plus but an interest in those fields
		  is all that is required.  Interested parties should
		  email Prof. Siegel.

Teaching

		I am currently teaching CISC 879.010
		(Formal Methods for High Performance Computing).

		I teach the following courses (semi-)regularly:

		
CISC 108, Introduction to Computer Science
		  I


		  CISC 372, Parallel Programming. MPI, OpenMP,
		  fundamental concepts of concurrency for both message-passing
		  and shared-memory models.
		  
CISC 414/614, Formal Methods in 
		  Software Engineering.  A core course in
		    UD's
		    Master
		      of Science in Software Engineering
		    program, this class gives an overview of formal
		    methods, with emphasis on practical applications
		    of tools such as Alloy, Spin, and Frama-C.
		  
CISC 475/675,
		  Advanced Software Engineering/Software Engineering Principles
		  and Practices.  This is a project-based course,
		  going through all stages of the software
		  lifecycle, including requirements engineering,
		  design, coding, testing and verification.
		  

		  CISC 879, advanced seminar.  Topics have included
		  Advanced Topics in Software
		  Verification, Abstract
		  Interpretation, Advanced Parallel
		  Computing.
		  

		    CISC 366/466, Independent Study. For undergraduate

Steve has extensive experience in a wide range of intellectual property matters within the mechanical arts. He has provided intellectual property counseling to clients in product packaging and packaging equipment, material handling and agricultural equipment, food product preparation equipment, medical devices and a variety of other areas. Earlier he was in-house counsel for Pullman, Incorporated, handling patent matters in connection with passenger and freight railroad equipment, tractor trailers, furnaces and kilns, oxygen lances for steel making and industrial chimney installations. He finds the work very stimulating and endeavors to share his enthusiasm with clients so they understand that for him this is more than just a "job."
He knows the firm itself recognizes the importance of considering intellectual property from the business perspective, helping ensure that the work product is cost-effective in the relevant context.
