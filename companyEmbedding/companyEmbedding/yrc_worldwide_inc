Freight. It's goods on the shelves when customers are ready to shop, parts in inventory to keep the line running, equipment on hand to get the job done. Moving freight takes dedicated people, working together, delivering an important service. It can mean the difference between success and failure for industrial, commercial and retail customers.
YRC Worldwide is a holding company for several successful freight companies that deliver reliable LTL (less than truckload) services across North America. You probably know us by our brand names:



YRC Worldwide providing corporate support for several national and regional LTL companies



YRC Freight providing comprehensive LTL North American coverage



YRC Reimer delivering LTL, expedited and guaranteed freight  services throughout Canada   



Reddaway serving customers in the Western United States and Canada



Holland moving goods in Central and Southeastern United States and Canada



New Penn delivering throughout the Northeastern United States, Canada and Puerto Rico



YRC Worldwide and its companies are seeking talented individuals who have the energy, discipline and commitment to customer service to keep the freight moving. Sound interesting? For the right people, we offer a wide range of operations, professional and sales opportunities in locations across North America.
