PureFunds ISE Big Data ETF, PureFunds® Solactive FinTech ETFETF Managers Group Announces Closures Of 2 ETFsTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 21 2017 21:30 BSTSource: Business Wire

SUMMIT, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 21, 2017--
      ETF Managers Group LLC (“ETFMG”) today announced that the Board of
      Trustees of the ETF Managers Trust has decided to close the PureFunds
      ISE Big Data ETF (BIGD) and the PureFunds Solactive FinTech ETF (FINQ)
      based on an ongoing review of market demand. Effective immediately, BIGD
      and FINQ will increase their cash holdings in contemplation of
      liquidation and will no longer accept creation orders.
    

      Trading will be suspended on the NYSE Arca for BIGD and on Nasdaq for
      FINQ at the closing of the market on July 31, 2017. Proceeds of the
      liquidation are scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about August
      1, 2017. For added information, shareholders can visit www.purefunds.com.
    

About ETF Managers Group (ETFMG)
    

      ETFMG is a leading Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) private label services
      company. ETFMG offers a full range of ETF product services to the asset
      management community including commodity pool ETPs as well as both
      active and passive ETF funds. The services provided include product

Before investing, carefully consider the Funds' investment
      objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This
      and additional information can be found in the Funds’ prospectuses,
      which may be obtained by calling 1-844-ETF-MGRS (1-844-383-6477), or by
      visiting 




www.purefunds.com




.



      Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.
      Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may
      trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed
      from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Narrowly
      focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility.
    

ETF Managers Group LLC is the investment adviser to the funds.
    

      The funds are distributed by ETFMG Financial LLC. ETF Managers Group LLC
      and ETFMG Financial LLC are wholly owned subsidiaries of Exchange Traded
      Managers Group LLC (collectively, “ETFMG”). ETFMG Financial LLC is not
      affiliated with PureFunds or Solactive.
