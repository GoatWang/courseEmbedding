LEWIS CENTER, Ohio, March 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DCB Financial Corp ("DCB"), (OTCPink: DCBF), parent holding company of The Delaware County Bank and Trust Company, Lewis Center, Ohio (the "Bank"), announced that it received approval from shareholders at a special meeting held today to complete its merger with First Commonwealth Financial Corporation ("First Commonwealth"). 








Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and between First Commonwealth and DCB, dated October 2, 2016, DCB will merge with and into First Commonwealth (the "Merger").
