The board of directors believes it to be in the best short-term and long-term interests of the shareholders to focus MediJane's energy and resources on creating medical products infused with cannabidiol (CBD), rather than traditional medical marijuana products at this time.MediJane has limited its business scope to only products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp, as defined in the 2014 U.S. Farming Bill.

The NMS Capital Investment Banking consists of seasoned professionals with in-depth domestic and international capital markets transaction experience.NMS will be working with the Company's senior management on the Company's strategic growth and business plan, including strategic acquisitions, corporate roll ups and expanding capital raising efforts. Specifically, NMS will advise the Company on various financing strategies and alternatives regarding its current capitalization plan. Documents prepared by NMS will be circulated to potential strategic investors via Private Investment Firms and/or Investment Banking Firms.Lewis Humer, Chairman of MediJane, said, "Our engagement with NMS Capital Advisors serves as a significant landmark in the Company's progression and application of our internal business and corporate strategy plan. This engagement substantiates the fundamental value of MediJane to our existing shareholders. We are looking forward to the advice and direction from Trevor M. Saliba and the NMS team. We believe that through NMS, we will accelerate growth strategies including key target acquisitions, roll-ups, and capital raising."Trevor M. Saliba, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NMS Capital Advisors LLC, said, "We are thrilled to be a part of a cutting edge, emerging market, where we believe that we can assist MediJane with their mid term and long term goals. Working as the broker dealer and investment bank for MediJane, one of our primary goals is to drive capital expansion which will enable MediJane to accelerate business expansion."About MediJane Holdings Inc.

(  OTCQB :  MJMD ) ("MediJane" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has completed the final formulation of its new Canna Liniment product line of topical analgesics. Canna Liniment is formulated for chronic pain and muscle soreness and will give pain sufferers another unique cannabinoid delivery system option. The new Canna Liniment formula is part of MediJane's continued penetration into the $45 billion pain management sector.The Canna Liniment product is a Chinese-style liniment made with cannabis oil, wintergreen essential oil, and menthol all adding to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. MediJane captures cannabis terpenes, which increase absorption and offer their own unique healing properties. "Being involved in sports and fitness for decades, I've used ordinary everyday liniments to help reduce pain and inflammation for many years. The American public is largely familiar with liniment products like Tiger Balm, Ben Gay, and Icy Hot. They're great products for what they do. Now we are able to provide relief to pain sufferers in a similar format but with the unique benefits of medical cannabis through our new and innovative formulation and Canna Liniment delivery system," stated Lewis "Spike" Humer, Chairman of MediJane. "The successful completion of the Canna Liniment formula allows us many more product development options, like roll-ons and a variety of balms, just to name a few. This once again represents another aspect of our constant evolution as a company and brand. We believe Canna Liniment will potentially provide numerous new revenue streams for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders." The Canna Liniment product line was developed under the guidance of MediJane Advisory Board member Pamela Clum. Prior to joining the MediJane Advisory Board in May 2014, she was the chief product formulator, developer, and marketer of the unique "CannaMist" brand of sublingual cannabinoid spray that is also now part of MediJane's portfolio of products exclusively licensed from Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Ms. Clum, who holds a Master's of Science in Botany from the University of Washington, formulated the first medicinal line of products containing cannabidiol (CBD) in the state of Colorado. About MediJane Holdings Inc. (MJMD)MediJane Holdings Inc. (MJMD) is in the business of marketing and distributing products within the medical marijuana industry, including transdermal patches, capsules, sublingual sprays, oral strips, and other medical delivery systems as part of its strategic alliances with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals (www.phoenixbiopharmaceuticals.com). With sales offices opening in California and Colorado, and a planned expansion into a national footprint, MediJane products are designed to give doctors the ability to provide patients accurate and effective doses of cannabinoids to manage and treat pain and other specific illnesses. MediJane's products, including the innovative non-drowsy "Daytime Pain plus CBD" oral capsule, the CannaMist cannabinoid spray, and the MediStrip Relaxation oral strips, have been formulated for the treatment of inflammation and chronic, neuropathic, arthritic, and back pain. These smokeless alternatives provide accurate dosages and are part of MediJane's launch into the chronic pain management market. Any and all medically oriented statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.For more information, visit www.medijane.coDisclaimer/Safe Harbor: Some information in this MediJane press release constitutes forward-looking statements or statements which may be deemed or construed to be forward-looking statements. The words "plan", "forecast", "anticipates", "estimate", "project", "intend", "expect", "should", "believe," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve, and are subject to, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause MediJane's actual results, performance (financial or operating) or achievements to differ from the future results, performance (financial or operating) or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors are more fully discussed in MediJane's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements attributable to MediJane herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by the above-mentioned cautionary statement. MediJane disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this press release, except as may be required by law.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextChina's army looks like it's getting ready for something big to go down in North KoreaBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredConservative media outlets are sending Trump a big warning on Jeff Sessions — and Trump is paying attentionBusiness InsiderDonald Trump thinks Jeff Bezos is his biggest threatYahoo FinanceEconomists answer, are we at full employment?Yahoo Finance VideoA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredFacebook earnings, Fed announcement — What you need to know in markets on WednesdayYahoo FinanceHere's Trump's approval rating in every stateBusiness InsiderSenate opens 'Obamacare' debate at last but outcome in doubtAssociated PressStart Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredFirst ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ Trailer LeakedInvestorPlaceFormer Obama official weighs in on Trump's plan to bring back manufacturing jobsYahoo Finance VideoWhy everybody should be happy that Flash is finally dyingYahoo FinancePeople in Heavy Debt May Be in For a Big SurpriseFreedom Debt ReliefSponsoredNBA veteran who was the frontrunner to become Cavs GM says he knew Kyrie Irving was unhappy and believes there's an 'alarming' factor to trading for himBusiness InsiderA conspiracy theory about Chipotle is gaining steamBusiness InsiderObama CIA director calls for a coup if Trump fires MuellerDick Tater: Sounds kinda illegal to me to try to mount a coup in this country.Join the Conversation1 / 579
