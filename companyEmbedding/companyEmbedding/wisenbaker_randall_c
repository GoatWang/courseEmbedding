Carpet will maintain its life and beauty for many years when properly cleaned and maintained.


Tile

Our tile offering ranges from ceramic, porcelain and natural stone to glass and metallics.  Tile is very design flexible and can be used to create dramatic first impressions. Even a modest area, indoors or out, can come to life with the colors and textures of tile.  When properly selected and installed, maintains its original qualities and lasts longer than other flooring options.


Hardwood

The variety and colors of wood flooring available today make it easy to find one that will compliment any design ideas you have. Not only is wood beautiful, but it’salso easy to clean and hypoallergenic. Whether you choose solid or engineered wood flooring, hardwood floors can add resale value to your home. Wood floors can last a lifetime and gain “character” with age.There’s no substitute for the warmth and natural beauty of wood.


Vinyl

Vinyl flooring is practical, durable, easy to maintain and the wide range of natural stone, wood and stunning mosaic designs make it stylish too.Vinyl has become sophisticated in its manufacture, with wood and stone designs as well as modern patterns.Examples include tiles and planks that mimic both the look and texture of wood or stone or ceramic tile.

TrustPoint Granite | Wisenbaker Builder Services Inc



































 






























































TrustPoint: A specific stage in the supply chain that a Builder treats as a point of trust.
The true beauty of a granite countertop is derived from its precise selection from the quarry and the fabrication and installation craftsmanship applied to it. To ensure the beauty and quality of all their granite countertop installations, Wisenbaker has established four supply chain TrustPoints. These benchmark standards give the Builder the assurance that their granite slabs will be qualified as Grade A – 1st Choice and the resulting countertops will be fabricated and installed on time, in a professional manner. Like the four Cs in the diamond industry, the four TrustPoints are rapidly becoming the industry standard by which all granite suppliers are judged.































 


Granite Countertops with Long-Term Stain Protection
TrustPoint™ Granite from Wisenbaker Builder Services features the revolutionary sealing technology of StainShield-15™. This breakthrough in granite protection carries a 15-Year Limited Stain Warranty that guarantees your new granite surface will stay beautiful, longer. And, unlike ordinary granite, there is no need to re-seal.
