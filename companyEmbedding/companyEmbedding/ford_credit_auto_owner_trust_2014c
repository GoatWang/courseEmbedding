      Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C
    





November 14, 2014 10:15 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C:
    

      --$381,500,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$508,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$504,400,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$105,510,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,350,000 class B 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,570,000 class C 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,570,000 class D 'NRsf'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2014-C pool is consistent with prior deals, 
      with a WA FICO score of 731 and 89.4% new vehicle contracts. The pool is 
      geographically diverse with WA seasoning of 9 months, while 43.9% of the 
      pool consists of loans with terms of more than 60 months.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes totals 5.50%, consisting of 7.00% subordination and a 
      0.50% non-declining reserve offset by under-collateralization of 2.00%, 
      on an adjusted pool basis.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      Ford Credit's portfolio and 2009-2013 securitizations are currently at 
      low levels, supported by the improving U.S. economy and stable used 
      vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year.
    

      Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term (LT) Issuer 
      Default Ratings (IDRs) of Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford 
      Credit, and Ford Credit is 'BBB-' with a Positive Rating Outlook.
    

      Slow Economic Recovery: A slower recovery and potential for volatility 
      could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis accounts for 
      this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the recent 
      recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss 
      performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer to service 
      2014-C.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of Ford 
      Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class B and C notes display 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing potential 
      downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. All classes of notes could experience downgrades of up 
      to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'

Fitch Affirms 3 and Upgrades 1 Class of Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms 3 and Upgrades 1 Class of Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 
      2014-C
    





September 28, 2016 11:26 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its on-going surveillance, Fitch Ratings has taken the 
      following rating actions on Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust (FCAOT) 2014-C:
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Stable 
      from Positive.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations of class A and class B notes reflect loss 
      coverage levels consistent with current ratings. While the upgrade of 
      class C is largely attributable to growing hard credit enhancement (CE) 
      levels since close and cumulative net losses (CNL) tracking well within 
      Fitch's initial loss proxy.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Ford Motor Credit Company's (FMCC) 
      retail auto loan originations, the sound financial and legal structure 
      of the transaction, and the strength of the servicing provided by FMCC.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited stable 
      performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising 
      loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material deterioration in 
      performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential 
      negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale

the Financial Institution or in blank or credited to another
securities account maintained in the name of the Financial
Institution.  In no case will any financial asset credited to
any Collateral Account be registered in the name of the Grantor,

Grantor unless the foregoing have been specially indorsed to the

Section
3.1.          
Control for Purposes of UCC .  If the Financial
Institution receives any order from the Secured Party or its
authorized agent (a) directing disposition of funds in any
Collateral Account or (b) directing transfer or redemption of the
financial assets relating to the Collateral Accounts (a “
Secured Party Order ”), the Financial Institution will
comply with the Secured Party Order without further consent by the
Grantor or any other person.

 

Section
3.2.          
Conflicting Orders or Instructions .  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time, the
Financial Institution receives conflicting orders or instructions
from the Secured Party and the Grantor, the Financial Institution
will follow the orders or instructions of the Secured Party and not
the Grantor.  The Financial Institution will (a) have no
obligation to investigate or inquire as to whether the Secured
Party is entitled pursuant to the Indenture or otherwise to deliver

party.

New York time (or another time as may be agreed between the
Financial Institution and the Grantor) on the Business Day
preceding a Payment Date or (b) a Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under the Notes and the Indenture
Trustee has provided notice of the continuing Default or Event of
Default to the Financial Institution, the Financial Institution
will, to the fullest extent practicable, invest and reinvest funds
in the Collateral Account in accordance with the last investment
instruction received, which will be deemed to be effective for that
investment.

portion of any Collateral Account), the Financial Institution
agrees that the security interest will be subordinate to the
security interest of the Secured Party.

 

Section
5.2.          
Set-off and Recoupment .  The financial assets, money
and other items credited to each Collateral Account will not be
subject to deduction, set-off, recoupment, banker’s lien, or
any other right in favor of any person other than the Secured
Party.  However, the Financial Institution may set off (a) all
amounts due to the Financial Institution for customary fees and
expenses for the routine maintenance and operation of each
Collateral Account, (b) the face amount of any checks which have
been credited to a Collateral Account but are subsequently returned
unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient funds and (c) any

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms 3 and Upgrades 1 Class of Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-CHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Fitch Affirms 3 and Upgrades 1 Class of Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-CBusiness WireSeptember 28, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its on-going surveillance, Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust (FCAOT) 2014-C:--Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class C upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Stable from Positive.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations of class A and class B notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with current ratings. While the upgrade of class C is largely attributable to growing hard credit enhancement (CE) levels since close and cumulative net losses (CNL) tracking well within Fitch's initial loss proxy.The ratings reflect the quality of Ford Motor Credit Company's (FMCC) retail auto loan originations, the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction, and the strength of the servicing provided by FMCC.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited stable performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1012290Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1012290Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

DETAILS OF THIS SERVICE FOR RATINGS FOR WHICH THE LEAD ANALYST IS BASED IN AN EU-REGISTERED ENTITY CAN BE FOUND ON THE ENTITY SUMMARY PAGE FOR THIS ISSUER ON THE FITCH WEBSITE.Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.Read MoreThe information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
