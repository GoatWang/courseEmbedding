The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems". The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility. The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is a technical indicator that was created to measure overbought and oversold market conditions. It dived, as 3 investors sold PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund shares while 12 reduced holdings. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. MA's may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. The Average Directional Index or ADX is a technical analysis indicator used to describe if a market is trending or not trending. For traders looking to capitalize on trends, the ADX may be an essential technical tool. The weekly steps can be used to determine a near-term trend. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Wells Fargo & Mn has invested 0% in PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund (NYSE:PKO). Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. When the price is above, this typically indicates a bullish trend. Pimco Corporate & Income Strategy Fund (PCN)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R presently is at -26.53. A CCI closer to +100 may provide an overbought signal, and a CCI near -100 may offer an oversold signal. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.
The Oasis Petroleum's (NYSE:OAS) "Buy" Rating Reaffirmed at Jefferies Group LLC
					Hudson Bay Capital Management LP bought a new stake in shares of Oasis Petroleum during the fourth quarter valued at $227,000. Finally, Advisory Services Network LLC acquired a new stake in Oasis Petroleum during the first quarter valued at $242,000.
					Pimco Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:PMF) announced a monthly dividend on Wednesday, July 5th, Wall Street Journal reports. Taking a glance at the relative strength indictor, we note that the 14-day RSI is now at 46.98, the 7-day stands at 46.27, and the 3-day is sitting at 48.42. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. 34,220 shares of the stock were exchanged.
