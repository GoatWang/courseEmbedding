History[edit]
The company was established first as Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company in Pennsylvania in October 1899 by John Barbey and a group of investors. The company was started with $11,000 and a 320-square-foot (30¬†m2) factory that was leased for $60/month. It was incorporated in Pennsylvania on December 4 of that same year. The manufacture of undergarments began in 1919, accompanied by a name change to Vanity Fair Mills. Shares were initially sold to the public in 1951.
The H.D. Lee Company (now Lee) was acquired by the company in 1969 and the corporate name was changed to VF Corporation, a fictitious name that is not legally registered, to reflect the more diverse product line. Blue Bell Inc., the owner of such brands as Wrangler and JanSport, was acquired in 1986, effectively doubling the size of VF and making it the largest publicly held clothing company.
The company announced the purchase of VF Corporation's "Vanity Fair" lingerie business by Fruit of the Loom for $350 million in cash on January 23, 2007.[8]
On February 28, 2007, VF Corporation acquired Majestic Athletic. On July 26, 2007, VF Corporation announced the purchase of 7 for all Mankind and lucy Activewear for a combined $885 million.[citation needed] Eric C. Wiseman became President, CEO, and Chairman in 2008.[9] Effective January 1, 2017 Steve Rendle took over CEO and President responsibilities.
In 2011, VF Corporation announced its intention to purchase Timberland for $2.2 billion.[citation needed] The deal closed in September 2011.[citation needed] On December 21, 2012, VF Imagewear was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to provide uniforms and insignia for Customs and Border Protection officers.[10] In February 2013, Imagewear was awarded a $50-million contract to manufacture uniforms for Transportation Security Administration officers.[11]

VF Outlet[edit]
In 1970, it was the suggestion of M.O. Lee, then President of VF Corporation, that established the VF Outlet business that Surplus products from VF sources including Berkshire International and Vanity Fair were sold to the public from a 5,000 square foot factory store, with only a drop cloth separating it from the company's manufacturing facility.[14] In doing so, VF Corporation created a brand-new retail industry, the outlet mall.
VF Outlet stores offer everyday apparel including brand name jeans, intimate apparel, activewear, swimwear, and more for women, men and children. The company currently operates 79 stores in 31 states nationwide.[15]
In October 2013, VF Outlet launched their ECommerce store.[16]
VF Outlet Center[edit]
VF Corporation, which opened their first VF Outlet factory store in 1970, was one of the earliest outlet operations, and opened their first outlet center in the country, in Reading, Pennsylvania. The outlet mall, located in Vanity Fair's old manufacturing mills, was dubbed the official "Outlet Capital of the World." [17] The corporate name was changed from VF Outlet Village to VF Outlet Center in 2008.
Today, the VF Outlet Center is owned and operated by VF Outlet, Inc. with over 1,000,000 square feet of retail space and more than 20 stores.[18]

History[edit]
The company was established first as Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company in Pennsylvania in October 1899 by John Barbey and a group of investors. The company was started with $11,000 and a 320-square-foot (30¬†m2) factory that was leased for $60/month. It was incorporated in Pennsylvania on December 4 of that same year. The manufacture of undergarments began in 1919, accompanied by a name change to Vanity Fair Mills. Shares were initially sold to the public in 1951.
The H.D. Lee Company (now Lee) was acquired by the company in 1969 and the corporate name was changed to VF Corporation, a fictitious name that is not legally registered, to reflect the more diverse product line. Blue Bell Inc., the owner of such brands as Wrangler and JanSport, was acquired in 1986, effectively doubling the size of VF and making it the largest publicly held clothing company.
The company announced the purchase of VF Corporation's "Vanity Fair" lingerie business by Fruit of the Loom for $350 million in cash on January 23, 2007.[8]
On February 28, 2007, VF Corporation acquired Majestic Athletic. On July 26, 2007, VF Corporation announced the purchase of 7 for all Mankind and lucy Activewear for a combined $885 million.[citation needed] Eric C. Wiseman became President, CEO, and Chairman in 2008.[9] Effective January 1, 2017 Steve Rendle took over CEO and President responsibilities.
In 2011, VF Corporation announced its intention to purchase Timberland for $2.2 billion.[citation needed] The deal closed in September 2011.[citation needed] On December 21, 2012, VF Imagewear was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to provide uniforms and insignia for Customs and Border Protection officers.[10] In February 2013, Imagewear was awarded a $50-million contract to manufacture uniforms for Transportation Security Administration officers.[11]

VF Outlet[edit]
In 1970, it was the suggestion of M.O. Lee, then President of VF Corporation, that established the VF Outlet business that Surplus products from VF sources including Berkshire International and Vanity Fair were sold to the public from a 5,000 square foot factory store, with only a drop cloth separating it from the company's manufacturing facility.[14] In doing so, VF Corporation created a brand-new retail industry, the outlet mall.
VF Outlet stores offer everyday apparel including brand name jeans, intimate apparel, activewear, swimwear, and more for women, men and children. The company currently operates 79 stores in 31 states nationwide.[15]
In October 2013, VF Outlet launched their ECommerce store.[16]
VF Outlet Center[edit]
VF Corporation, which opened their first VF Outlet factory store in 1970, was one of the earliest outlet operations, and opened their first outlet center in the country, in Reading, Pennsylvania. The outlet mall, located in Vanity Fair's old manufacturing mills, was dubbed the official "Outlet Capital of the World." [17] The corporate name was changed from VF Outlet Village to VF Outlet Center in 2008.
Today, the VF Outlet Center is owned and operated by VF Outlet, Inc. with over 1,000,000 square feet of retail space and more than 20 stores.[18]

History[edit]
The company was established first as Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company in Pennsylvania in October 1899 by John Barbey and a group of investors. The company was started with $11,000 and a 320-square-foot (30¬†m2) factory that was leased for $60/month. It was incorporated in Pennsylvania on December 4 of that same year. The manufacture of undergarments began in 1919, accompanied by a name change to Vanity Fair Mills. Shares were initially sold to the public in 1951.
The H.D. Lee Company (now Lee) was acquired by the company in 1969 and the corporate name was changed to VF Corporation, a fictitious name that is not legally registered, to reflect the more diverse product line. Blue Bell Inc., the owner of such brands as Wrangler and JanSport, was acquired in 1986, effectively doubling the size of VF and making it the largest publicly held clothing company.
The company announced the purchase of VF Corporation's "Vanity Fair" lingerie business by Fruit of the Loom for $350 million in cash on January 23, 2007.[8]
On February 28, 2007, VF Corporation acquired Majestic Athletic. On July 26, 2007, VF Corporation announced the purchase of 7 for all Mankind and lucy Activewear for a combined $885 million.[citation needed] Eric C. Wiseman became President, CEO, and Chairman in 2008.[9] Effective January 1, 2017 Steve Rendle took over CEO and President responsibilities.
In 2011, VF Corporation announced its intention to purchase Timberland for $2.2 billion.[citation needed] The deal closed in September 2011.[citation needed] On December 21, 2012, VF Imagewear was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to provide uniforms and insignia for Customs and Border Protection officers.[10] In February 2013, Imagewear was awarded a $50-million contract to manufacture uniforms for Transportation Security Administration officers.[11]

VF Outlet[edit]
In 1970, it was the suggestion of M.O. Lee, then President of VF Corporation, that established the VF Outlet business that Surplus products from VF sources including Berkshire International and Vanity Fair were sold to the public from a 5,000 square foot factory store, with only a drop cloth separating it from the company's manufacturing facility.[14] In doing so, VF Corporation created a brand-new retail industry, the outlet mall.
VF Outlet stores offer everyday apparel including brand name jeans, intimate apparel, activewear, swimwear, and more for women, men and children. The company currently operates 79 stores in 31 states nationwide.[15]
In October 2013, VF Outlet launched their ECommerce store.[16]
VF Outlet Center[edit]
VF Corporation, which opened their first VF Outlet factory store in 1970, was one of the earliest outlet operations, and opened their first outlet center in the country, in Reading, Pennsylvania. The outlet mall, located in Vanity Fair's old manufacturing mills, was dubbed the official "Outlet Capital of the World." [17] The corporate name was changed from VF Outlet Village to VF Outlet Center in 2008.
Today, the VF Outlet Center is owned and operated by VF Outlet, Inc. with over 1,000,000 square feet of retail space and more than 20 stores.[18]

VF Outlet[edit]
In 1970, it was the suggestion of M.O. Lee, then President of VF Corporation, that established the VF Outlet business that Surplus products from VF sources including Berkshire International and Vanity Fair were sold to the public from a 5,000 square foot factory store, with only a drop cloth separating it from the company's manufacturing facility.[14] In doing so, VF Corporation created a brand-new retail industry, the outlet mall.
VF Outlet stores offer everyday apparel including brand name jeans, intimate apparel, activewear, swimwear, and more for women, men and children. The company currently operates 79 stores in 31 states nationwide.[15]
In October 2013, VF Outlet launched their ECommerce store.[16]
VF Outlet Center[edit]
VF Corporation, which opened their first VF Outlet factory store in 1970, was one of the earliest outlet operations, and opened their first outlet center in the country, in Reading, Pennsylvania. The outlet mall, located in Vanity Fair's old manufacturing mills, was dubbed the official "Outlet Capital of the World." [17] The corporate name was changed from VF Outlet Village to VF Outlet Center in 2008.
Today, the VF Outlet Center is owned and operated by VF Outlet, Inc. with over 1,000,000 square feet of retail space and more than 20 stores.[18]

V.F. Corp. Beats Yet AgainHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0V.F. Corp. Beats Yet Again Zacks Equity Research ZacksApril 27, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareV.F. Corporation (VFC) reported first-quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of $1.94 per share, striding ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.88. The result also surpassed adjusted earnings of $1.82 per share in the prior-year quarter.The robust increase in earnings per share was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and a contribution of 12 cents per share from the Timberland acquisition. On a reported basis, the company‚Äôs earnings came in at $1.91 per share.Operational PerformanceV.F. Corp.'s first-quarter revenue of $2,556 million exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,448 million. Revenues eclipsed the year-ago figure by 31%, with Timberland contributing significantly to quarterly revenue.Substantial revenue growth at all V.F. Corp.'s coalitions led to the overall climb. During the quarter, Outdoor & Action Sports segment was the strongest, recording a 60% rise in revenue.Costs and operating expenses on a year-over-year basis increased 33.1% in the reported quarter. Gross margin in the quarter declined 150 basis points to 45.7% from its previous high of 47.2% in the year-ago quarter, resulting from higher product costs in the Jeanswear segment. Adjusted operating margin, excluding Timberland, contracted 50 basis points to 13.5%.Segment PerformanceRevenue at Outdoor & Action Sports jumped 60% from the year-ago quarter to $1,264 million, of which Timberland and Smartwool brands contributed $356 million. Business from both the Americas and international operations contributed to the revenue increase.First-quarter operating income (including Timberland) increased 40% from the year-ago quarter to $202 million, while operating margin contracted 230 basis points year over year to 16.0%. However, excluding Timberland, operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 20.3%.Jeanswear revenue increased 9% to $741.7 million, driven by double-digit growth at the domestic brands, while international jeans revenue declined marginally. However, the segment‚Äôs operating income and margin in the quarter dropped due to higher product costs.Imagewear revenue increased 12% in the quarter to $277.5 million, driven by a 21% and 3% revenue growth in Image business and Licensed Sports, respectively. Moreover, operating income at the segment jumped 16% in the quarter, with margin expanding 50 basis points to 15.5%.Revenue at Sportswear increased 10% to $122.9 million driven by revenue growth in its U.S. brands, namely Nautica and Kipling.¬† Operating income in the quarter climbed 44% while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 8.7%.Contemporary Brands experienced a revenue increase of 13% to $126.9 million with growth across all its brands. Operating income rose 53% during the quarter, registering a substantial improvement in gross margins, which expanded 300 basis points to 11.7%.The company‚Äôs international revenues increased 48%, contributing about 40% to total revenue. The growth was largely driven by strength across the biggest brands in Asia and Europe. Additionally, Timberland contributed 33 percentage points to this growth.Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 49% in the quarter, driven by new store openings and the Timberland acquisition. The company opened 24 stores across diverse brands in the quarter, bringing the total number of owned retail stores to 1,059 at the end of first-quarter 2012. Timberland contributed 32 percentage points to this growth.Balance SheetV.F. Corp. ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $325.6 million and long-term debt of $1,831.1 million. The company‚Äôs shareholder equity came in at $4,451.7 million at the end of the first quarter of 2012.DividendThe board of directors of V.F. Corp. declared a quarterly cash dividend of 72 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on June 18, 2012 to shareholders of record as of June 8, 2012.Looking into 2012Bolstered by better-than-expected quarterly results, the company now expects earnings of approximately $9.45 per share in fiscal 2012, up 15 cents from $9.30 per share guided earlier.¬† However, the company retained the expected earnings contribution from Timberland at $1.10 per share.The company maintains its revenue projection of an increase of approximately 15% year over year to $10.9 billion in fiscal 2012. Timberland is expected to contribute about $1 billion to fiscal 2012 revenue.However, the company expects earnings per share comparisons for the second quarter of 2012 to be challenging, due to the seasonal nature of Timberland business (which has historically posted losses in the second quarter), a negative impact from foreign currency translation and higher pension expense, partly offset by gains from facility closures.Our TakeWe expect V.F. Corp. to continue delivering on its potential, given the proven performance across its segments, its focus to build brand image via incremental marketing spending and its committed returns to shareholders by virtue of share buybacks and dividend payouts.Moreover, we believe that V.F. Corp.‚Äôs policy to acquire businesses providing strategic opportunities and exiting businesses having lower potential have helped the company to drive growth while improving profitability.The recent merger of Timberland in the V.F. Corporation portfolio of brands of outdoor and action sports business comprising Vans, Jansport, Eastpak and other brands, will account for 50% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2012, which is expected to rise to 60% by 2015.Based in Greensboro, North Carolina, V.F. Corp. is one of the world's largest apparel companies. The company, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of branded apparel and related products in the United States and internationally. Major competitors of the company are Gap Inc. (GPS) and Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD).V.F. Corp. currently retains a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates to a short-term Buy rating. However, we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.Read the Full Research Report on VFCRead the Full Research Report on SHLD Read the Full Research Report on GPS Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read the analyst report on VFC,SHLD,GPSReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityEmily Ratajkowski Poses Poolside in Perplexing Cutout Top660 reactions7%71%22%Eight bodies found in overheated truck in a Walmart in Texas879 reactions3%77%20%Liev Schreiber Took His Son to Comic-Con Dressed as Harley Quinn2,250 reactions5%63%32%Trump suggests Republicans should ‚Äòprotect their president‚Äô9,349 reactions5%64%31%Venezuela‚Äôs symphony of protests167 reactions6%69%25%Texas tractor-trailer incident called 'horrific' case of human smuggling20 reactions3%68%29%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1499 reactions3%80%17%Report: Kyrie Irving believes LeBron James leaked trade request360 reactions3%79%18%Young Reds fan gets angry with Dee Gordon, kicks him in the shin1,286 reactions4%63%33%Ivanka Trump Misquoted Einstein And The Internet Loves It1,199 reactions5%67%28%Amazing images of light under desert archways128 reactions14%77%9%Mixed messages from White House on talk of pardons15 reactions0%79%21%Historic Pearl River Mart Reopens to Bring 'Cross-Cultural Joy' to NYC206 reactions8%68%24%'Horrific' human-smuggling incident in Texas not an isolated event, officials say5,347 reactions4%73%23%This former bodybuilder‚Äôs photo of herself after gaining 25 lbs. has a beautiful, body-positive message142 reactions12%62%26%A 'big fall' in markets is coming as traders put record cash to work48 reactions6%67%27%Six Months of Trump: More People Want to See the President Impeached Than Nixonhiggsboson: All of the orange idiot's incompetence was on full display during the campaign.

Company History
In 1899, Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company was established by John Barbey and a group of investors in Pennsylvania. In 1919, the company begins to manufacture undergarments and the name changes to Vanity Fair Silk Mills. The company goes public in 1951 to finance futher expansion. In 1969, the jeans-maker H.D. Lee Company is acquired and the company changes its name to VF Corporation to cover the expanding lines of apparel. With the acquisition of Blue Bell, Inc. in 1986, the company becomes the world's largest publicly held apparel company. The company continues to expand through the 1990s through a series of acquisitions and licensing agreements in the United States, as well as in Europe. In 2007, VF decides to exit the intimate apparel business. [5]

Corporate Accountability
Paragraph
Labor
Domestic
"VF employed approximately 45,500 men and women in its continuing operations at the end of 2006, of which 17,300 were located in the United States. (Excluded are approximately 8,700 employees of the intimate apparel businesses accounted for as discontinued operations at the end of 2006.) Approximately 300 employees in the United States are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good." 10-K 2007
Global
Policy:

1997: adopts Global Compliance Principles
2000: requires Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP) certification of all owned facilities. VF Corporation has been affiliated with WRAP since its inception. Candace S. Cummings (VP-Administration, General Counsel & Secretary) is on the WRAP Board of Directors. [1]
2004: joins Fair Labor Association
"All contracted production must meet VF‚Äôs high quality standards. Further, each of the over 1,500 independent contractors that manufacture apparel products for VF must be pre-certified and sign a Terms of Engagement agreement prior to performance of any production on VF‚Äôs behalf. These requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws. We also require our independent licensees and their contractors to comply with these standards. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff." 10-K 2007

Campaigns against company:

2001: workers at the International Garments Manufacturing Corp. in the Philippines strike to protest union-busting. Factory produces VF brand Wrangler and for Gap Inc. and these companies are pressured to intervene with factory management through a letter-writing campaign initiated by the Clean Clothes Campaign. Workers were not successful and financial difficulties forced them to accept separation pay. [7]
2003: workers at the Jaqalanka Ltd. factory in Sri Lanka are denied unionization. Factory produces for VF brand Red Kap and for Nike. Nike and Free Trade Zone Workers Union requested that Fair Labor Association investigate the dispute. After an FLA investigation and pressure from clients, factory management agrees to recognize union. [8]
2004: National Labor Committee includes VF Corporation in a campaign against forty companies producing in Bangladesh. The goal is for firms to pledge to abide by legal labor protections for pregnant women. VF has not signed the pledge. [9]

Customers
"VF‚Äôs customers are specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass merchants in the United States and in international markets, primarily in Europe. Sales to VF‚Äôs ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based in the United States, amounted to 30% of Total Revenues in 2006, 31% in 2005 and 35% in 2004. These larger customers included (in alphabetical order) Federated Department Stores, Inc., Kohl‚Äôs Corporation, J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Sears Holding Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 24% of Total Revenues in 2006, 25% in 2005 and 28% in 2004. Sales to VF‚Äôs largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., totaled 13.2% of Total Revenues in 2006, 14.0% in 2005 and 13.5% in 2004, substantially all of which were in the Jeanswear Coalition." 10-K 2007
Suppliers
"Our domestic jeanswear and imagewear businesses operate owned manufacturing facilities (primarily cutting, sewing and finishing) principally located in Mexico and Central America. Our international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in Poland, Turkey and Malta. For these owned production plants, we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers for scheduled production. ... No single supplier represents more than 4% of our total cost of sales. Over the last several years, VF has shifted production from the United States to lower cost locations. As a result of this shift in sourcing, approximately 32% of our domestic Net Sales in 2006 were manufactured in VF-owned facilities, primarily in Mexico and Central America, and 67% were obtained from contractors, primarily in Asia. Similarly, European jeanswear sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in Western Europe to lower cost owned production outside of Western Europe and contracted production in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. To an increasing extent, we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship only finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs in Hong Kong and Miami. These hubs are responsible for product procurement, product quality assurance and supplier management and handling functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, respectively. All products in the Outdoor and Sportswear Coalitions, as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our other coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs....The current sourcing strategy for products sold in the United States allows us to balance our needs with a mix of VF-owned and contracted production in the Western Hemisphere, combined with contracted production primarily from Asia. Owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted production. Overall, product obtained from the Western Hemisphere has somewhat higher cost but gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the Far East and other more distant resources. This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a balanced approach to product sourcing. " 10-K 2007

Wrangler and North Face parent VF Corp. misses profit and sales expectations
Shares of VF Corp.  fell 1.6% in light premarket trade Friday, after the apparel maker and accessories seller, which brands include Lee and Wrangler jeans and JanSport and The North Face outdoor products, missed first-quarter profit and sales expectations. Net earnings fell to $209.2 million, or 50 cents a share, from $260.3 million, or 61 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, ongoing earnings per share came to 52 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 55 cents. Revenue declined 2% to $2.58 billion, missing the FactSet consensus of $2.73 billion, as a slight beat in outdoor and action sports sales was offset by bigger-than-expected declines in jeanswear, imagewear and sportswear. The company affirmed its 2017 revenue growth outlook in the "low single-digit" percentage range. "The company's largest brands and international and direct-to-consumer platforms performed well, delivering solid results against a retail backdrop that continues to experience significant dislocation," said Chief Executive Steve Randle. The stock has climbed 8.4% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.
