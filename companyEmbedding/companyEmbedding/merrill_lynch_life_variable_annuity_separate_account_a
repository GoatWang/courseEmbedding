Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser.

What is an annuity?

Annuities are long-term investments specifically designed for retirement. They can help replace a paycheck with predictable income. The income—paid either through optional living benefits for an additional cost or through annuitization, which converts your assets into an income stream—is backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. For many people, buying an annuity offers the reassurance that they won't outlive their investments.



Annuities may help:


Generate guaranteed income in retirement
Accumulate potential tax-deferred earnings
Reduce volatility in a retirement portfolio, though variable annuities are subject to market risk
Invest for retirement beyond 401(k)s and IRAs

How to choose an annuity
There are two basic types of annuities:


Deferred annuities begin in the accumulation phase. The owner pays premiums into the annuity and chooses from the available investment options. During this phase, earnings typically accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. The owner has the flexibility to start the distribution, or income, phase at a later date, often coinciding with a retirement date.
Immediate annuities go directly into the distribution phase. There is no accumulation phase. Immediate annuities offer owners a choice of income options in exchange for the premium payment.


There are two types of deferred annuities:


Fixed annuities offer a fixed rate of return for a specified period of time. You can select the time period that may be right for you based on your investment horizon and retirement income needs.




Variable annuities offer a wide range of professionally managed investment options. The value of the annuity contract fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options (also called subaccounts) chosen by the owner. Optional living benefit riders are available at an additional cost and can provide guaranteed lifetime income, regardless of how the annuity's investments perform.

1 Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. A Merrill Edge Financial Solutions Advisor™ can provide you with more information, including a current prospectus. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses contain more complete details on the investment objectives, risks, fees, charges and expenses, as well as other information about the contract and the underlying portfolios which should be carefully considered. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing. Investing in securities involves risks, and there is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities.
You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care. Please contact a Merrill Edge rollover specialist at 888.637.3343 for additional information about your choices.

This information was prepared to support the promotion and marketing of insurance and/or annuity products.

All annuity contract or rider guarantees, including optional benefits and any fixed subaccount crediting rates or annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. They are not backed by Merrill Lynch or its affiliates, nor does Merrill Lynch or its affiliates make any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed to help meet retirement needs. A variable annuity is a contractual agreement where a client makes payments to an insurance company, which, in turn, agrees to pay out an income stream or a lump sum amount at a later date. Variable annuities typically offer (1) tax-deferred treatment of earnings; (2) a death benefit; and (3) annuity payout options that can provide guaranteed income for life. Variable annuity contract values will fluctuate and are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal. There are contract limitations, fees and charges associated with variable annuities which include, but are not limited to mortality and expense risk charges, sales and surrender charges, administrative fees, charges for optional benefits as well as charges for the underlying investment options. Early withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and taxed as ordinary income, and in addition, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. Withdrawals reduce annuity contract benefit, values and optional guarantees in any amount that may be more than the actual withdrawal. Past performance should not be a representation of future performance.

Merrill Edge and its Financial Solutions Advisors do not provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Please consult your own independent advisor as to any tax, accounting or legal statements made herein.

Delaware VIP Trust, and the MFS(R) Variable Insurance TrustSM (the "Substituted 
Portfolios").

*    Under certain MLLIC and MLLICNY contracts, subaccounts investing in the    
Substituted Portfolios were closed to the allocation of premium and contract    
value on May 1, 2003, and subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolios   
became available for the allocation of premium and contract value at that time. 
Under other MLLIC and MLLICNY contracts, investment divisions or subaccounts    
investing in the Substituted Portfolios will continue to be available for the   
allocation of premium and investment base or contract value, and investment     
divisions or subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolios will not be    
available, until the substitutions occur.                                       

P-->4973rd�Page�of�4TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd
The proposed substitutions will not be carried out unless contract owners       
invested in the Substituted Portfolios as of a to-be-specified record date      
approve the substitutions. MLLIC and MLLICNY anticipate that, if SEC approval is
granted, contract owner approval is obtained, and all of the systems needed to  
perform the substitutions are in place, the proposed substitutions will occur   
sometime during the fourth quarter of 2003. To the extent required by law,      
approvals of the proposed substitutions also will be obtained from the state    
insurance regulators in certain jurisdictions. Contract owners invested in the  
Substituted Portfolios as of the record date will receive detailed information  
about the proposed substitutions.                                               

MLLIC and MLLICNY propose to carry out the proposed substitutions by redeeming  
shares of the Substituted Portfolios and purchasing shares of the corresponding 
Replacement Portfolios. Any investment base or contract value that you have     
allocated to an investment division or subaccount investing in the Substituted  
Portfolio(s) on the date of the substitutions will, in effect, be transferred to
an investment division or subaccount investing in the corresponding Replacement 
Portfolio(s). Currently, MLLIC and MLLICNY do not impose a charge for transfers 
or limit the number of transfers permitted each year (although they have        
reserved the right to charge for transfers in excess of a specified number and  
may refuse to make "market timing" transfers). From July 18, 2003 through 30    
days following the date of the proposed substitutions, you may make one transfer
of investment base or contract value from an investment division or subaccount  
investing in the Substituted Portfolio(s) (before the substitutions) or the     
Replacement Portfolio(s) (after the substitutions) to any other available       
investment division(s) or subaccount(s) without that transfer counting towards  
the number of transfers permitted should MLLIC and/or MLLICNY begin charging for
or otherwise limiting transfers in the future. In addition, neither MLLIC nor   
MLLICNY will exercise any rights it may have under your contract to impose      
restrictions or charges on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed  
substitutions occur.                                                            

The following discussion sets out brief information about the Replacement       
Portfolios. The Replacement Portfolios are described in more detail in their    
current prospectuses. All contract owners have received or will receive a       
current prospectus for each Replacement Portfolio prior to the substitutions.   
These prospectuses describe the Replacement Portfolios' investment policies,    
risks, fees and expenses, and all other aspects of their operations, and should 
be read carefully before investing. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY REPLACEMENT  
PORTFOLIO WILL ACHIEVE ITS STATED OBJECTIVES. Additional copies of the MLIG     
Variable Insurance Trust's prospectus and statement of additional information,  
which include detailed information on each Replacement Portfolio, can be        
obtained directly from the Trust without charge by calling the MLIG Service     
Center at (800) 535-5549 or writing the MLIG Service Center at P.O. Box 44222,  
Jacksonville, FL 32231-4222.                                                    

ROSZEL/DELAWARE TREND PORTFOLIO OF THE MLIG VARIABLE INSURANCE TRUST            

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.  To seek long-term capital appreciation.                  

INVESTMENT POLICIES. The portfolio invests at least 65% of total assets in small
cap equities of companies believed to have potential for high earnings growth.  
The portfolio's investment adviser seeks small companies that offer substantial 
opportunities for long-term price appreciation because they are poised to       
benefit from changing and dominant social and political trends. The portfolio's 
investment adviser evaluates company management, product development and sales  
and earnings, and it seeks market leaders, strong product cycles, innovate      
concepts, and industry trends. Also considered are a company's price-to-earning 
ratio, estimated growth rates, market cap, and cash flows to determine the      
company's attractiveness. To reduce the risk of investing in small cap          
companies, the portfolio invests in a well-diversified portfolio of different   
stocks representing a wide array of industries. The portfolio uses the Russell  
2500 Growth Index as a performance benchmark. The portfolio may invest up to 25%
of total assets in foreign securities.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE. To seek long-term capital appreciation.                   

INVESTMENT POLICIES. The portfolio invests at least 65% of total assets in large
cap stocks of companies believed to potential for high earnings growth. These   
companies are generally well-established issuers with strong business franchises
and favorable long-term growth prospects. The portfolio's investment adviser    
seeks to achieve a consistent, favorable balance of growth and value with stocks
of companies in the Russell 1000 and the S&P 500 Indexes. In choosing companies 
to invest in, the portfolio's investment adviser first looks at dividend growth,
earnings growth, relative growth of earnings over time, the company's history of
meeting earnings targets, and price-to-earnings ratios and other ratios that    
reveal value. The most promising companies are then evaluated on the basis of   
management strength, competitiveness in their industries, business prospects,   
and profitability. The portfolio sells stocks when their price declines relative
to other stocks invested in by the portfolio or to other companies in the same  
business industry or when the issuer's earnings decline. The portfolio may      
invest up to 10% of total assets in foreign securities. The portfolio uses the  
S&P 500 Index as a benchmark index.

1 MLIG Variable Insurance Trust has entered into an expense limitation          
arrangement with the investment adviser to the Replacement Portfolios whereby   
the investment adviser will reimburse the Replacement Portfolios to the extent  
total operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions,     
expenses in the form of fees paid to the Trust service providers by brokers in  
connection with directed brokerage arrangements, other expenditures that are    
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and    
other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of each        
Portfolio's business) exceed certain limits. The expense limitation agreement is
effective through April 30, 2004, and is expected to continue from year to year,
conditioned upon approval for continuance by the board of trustees of the MLIG  
Variable Insurance Trust.

Substituted portfoliosReplacement portfoliosAllianceBernstein Quasar Portfolio of the AllianceBernstein FundRoszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio of the MLIG Trust.Investment Objective—To seek growth of capital by pursuing aggressive investment policies. The portfolio treats current income as incidental to its objectiveInvestment Objective—To seek long-term capital appreciation.Investment Policies—Generally, the portfolio invests in a widely diversified mix of equity securities across many industries that offer the possibility of above-average earnings growth. Currently, the portfolio's investment adviser emphasizes investing in small cap companies, and it invests both in well-known and established companies and in new and unseasoned companies. The portfolio may invest in any securities with the potential for capital appreciation. In choosing securities, the portfolio's investment adviser considers the economic and political outlook, management capabilities and practices, and trends in the determinants of corporate profits, among others. The portfolio may also invest in non-convertible bonds, preferred stocks, and foreign securitiesInvestment Policies—The portfolio invests at least 65% of total assets in small cap equities of companies believed to have potential for high earnings growth. The portfolio's investment adviser seeks small companies that offer substantial opportunities for long-term price appreciation because they are poised to benefit from changing and dominant social and political trends. The portfolio's investment adviser evaluates company management, product development and sales and earnings, and it seeks market leaders, strong product cycles, innovative concepts, and industry trends. Also considered are a company's price-to-earning ratio, estimated growth rates, market cap, and cash flows to determine the company's attractiveness. To reduce the risk of investing in small cap companies, the portfolio invests in a well-diversified portfolio of different stocks representing a wide array of industries. The portfolio uses the Russell 2500 Growth Index as a performance benchmark. The portfolio may invest up to 25% of total assets in foreign securities.Delaware VIP Trend Series of the Delaware Trust.Investment Objective—To seek long-term capital appreciation.Start Printed Page 61489Investment Policies—The Series invests mainly in stocks of small, growth-oriented or emerging companies that the portfolio's investment adviser believes are responsive to changes in the marketplace and have prospects for continued growth. The portfolio's investment adviser looks for market leaders, strong product cycles, innovative concepts, and industry trends, and also examines price-to-earnings ratios, estimated growth rates, market caps, and cash flow when it selects stocks for investmentMFS Research Series of the MFS TrustRoszel/PIMCO CCM Capital Appreciation Portfolio of the MLIG Trust.Investment Objective—To seek long-term growth of capital and future incomeInvestment Objective—To seek long-term capital appreciation.Investment Policies—Normally, the Series invests at least 80% of its net assets in common stocks and related securities (preferred stocks, convertible securities and depositary receipts for those securities), and focuses on companies, regardless of size, believed to have favorable prospects for long-term growth, attractive valuations based on current and expected earnings or cash flow, dominant or growing market share, and superior management. The Series may also invest in junk bonds and in foreign securities(including emerging markets securities). The Series' assets are allocated among various industriesInvestment Policies—The portfolio invests at least 65% of total assets in large cap stocks of companies believed to have potential for high earnings growth. These companies are generally well-established issuers with strong business franchises and favorable long-term growth prospects. The portfolio's investment adviser seeks to achieve a consistent, favorable balance of growth and value with stocks of companies in the Russell 1000 and the S&P 500 Indexes. In choosing companies to invest in, the portfolio's investment adviser first looks at dividend growth, earnings growth, relative growth of earnings over time, the company's history of meeting earnings targets, and price-to-earnings ratios and other ratios that reveal value. The most promising companies are then evaluated on the basis of management strength, competitiveness in their industries, business prospects, and profitability. The portfolio sells stocks when their price declines relative to other stocks invested in by the portfolio or to other companies in the same business industry or when the issuer's earnings decline. The portfolio may invest up to 10% of total assets in foreign securities. The portfolio uses the S&P 500 Index as a benchmark index.MFS Investors Trust Series of the MFS Trust.Investment Objective—To provide long-term growth of capital, with reasonable current income as a secondary objective Investment Policies—Normally, the Series invests at least 65% of net assets in common stocks and related securities (preferred stocks, convertible securities and depositary receipts for those securities). The portfolio's investment adviser generally focuses on companies with larger market caps(although it may invest in companies of any size) believed to have sustainable growth prospects and attractive valuations based on current and expected earnings or cash flow. The portfolio's investment adviser will attempt to generate gross current income equal to about 90% of the dividend yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index. The portfolio's investment adviser selects securities by analyzing earnings, cash flows, competitive position and management's abilities. The Series may invest in foreign equity securities

18. “Other Expenses” for the Roszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio and the Roszel/PIMCO CCM Capital Appreciation Portfolio are based on estimates for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, MLIG Trust has entered into an expense limitation arrangement with Roszel Advisors whereby Roszel Advisors will reimburse the Roszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio and the Roszel/PIMCO CCM Capital Appreciation Portfolio to the extent total operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses in the form of fees paid to the Trust service providers by brokers in connection with directed brokerage arrangements, other expenditures that are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of each Portfolio's business) exceed certain limits. The expense limitation agreement is effective through April 30, 2004, and is expected to continue from year to year, conditioned upon approval for continuance by the board of trustees of the MLIG Trust. Net Operating Expenses for the AllianceBernstein Quasar Portfolio do not reflect fees waived or expenses assumed by Alliance during the year ended December 31, 2002. Such waivers and assumption of expenses were made on a voluntary basis, and Alliance has discontinued this waiver. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, Alliance waived management fees totaling 0.12% and other expenses totaling 0.02% for the AllianceBernstein Quasar Portfolio. After considering such reimbursements, actual Net Operating Expenses were 1.11%. DMC, the adviser to the Series, has contracted to waive fees and pay expenses through April 30, 2004 in order to prevent the Series' total operating expenses (excluding any 12b-1 fees, taxes, interest, brokerage fees, and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 0.95% of average daily net assets.
19. Pursuant to their authority under the respective Variable Contracts and the prospectuses describing the same, and subject to the approval of the Commission under Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act, MLLIC and MLNY propose to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Substituted Portfolios in the Separate Accounts (the “Substitutions”).
20. The Substitutions are part of an overall business plan involving the management of MLLIC and MLNY to make their respective products, including the Variable Contracts, more competitive (both in terms of new sales, as well as with regard to the retention of existing blocks of business) and more efficient to administer and oversee. The proposed Substitutions are consistent with this business plan and involve mutual funds with similar investment objectives.
21. Over the past several years, MLLIC and MLNY have engaged in a thorough review of the efficiencies and structures of all of the investment options they offer under the Variable Contracts. As part of this ongoing effort to make the Variable Contracts more competitive, the Applicants engaged in certain substitutions on May 1, 2002. Based on their continuing evaluation of the available investment options, MLLIC and MLNY believe that more concentrated and streamlined operations for investment options could result in increased operational and administrative efficiencies and economies of scale for the Companies. More specifically, MLLIC and MLNY feel that streamlining the number of nonproprietary fund families available through the Variable Contracts and altering the available portfolios will simplify the administration of the Variable Contracts, particularly with regard to communications with the fund families and the preparation of various reports and disclosure documents. This streamlining will allow them to enhance their communication efforts to Variable Contract owners and sales representatives regarding the available portfolios, and may provide for more enhanced and timely reporting to MLLIC and MLNY from fund families and therefore from MLLIC and MLNY to Variable Contract owners. Furthermore, reducing the number of nonproprietary fund families also will provide MLLIC and MLNY with more control over fund changes that affect their Variable Contracts, allowing for appropriate long-term strategic planning.
22. During this continuing evaluation of the available investment options, MLLIC and MLNY also have engaged in a thorough review of the quality of all of the investment options offered under the Variable Contracts. This due diligence review involved an evaluation of the investment performance, the investment process, and the investment Start Printed Page 61491teams responsible for the management of the Substituted Portfolios. Ultimately, MLLIC and MLNY concluded that the Substituted Portfolios offered under the Variable Contracts warrant replacement and that it would be preferable to make alternative investment options available to both current and future Variable Contract owners. Consequently, MLLIC and MLNY identified certain investment options (i.e., the Replacement Portfolios) that MLLIC and MLNY feel would be more competitive and more attractive to Variable Contract owners. In fact, under certain of the Variable Contracts (where administratively feasible), MLLIC and MLNY closed the subaccounts investing in the Substituted Portfolios to the allocation of premium and contract value on May 1, 2003, and simultaneously added new investment options that invest in the Replacement Portfolios.
23. MLLIC and MLNY also feel that these options would better promote their goals of increasing administrative efficiency of, and control over, their Variable Contracts if they were a part of their affiliated fund families. For example, one of the proposed Substitutions involves the Roszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio, which is modeled on one of its corresponding Substituted Portfolios, the Delaware VIP Trend Series; this Replacement Portfolio also shares an identical investment objective and substantially similar policies, restrictions, and risks as this Substituted Portfolio. In addition, as the Replacement Portfolios operate pursuant to the Manager of Managers Order, the Substitutions would provide protection to Variable Contract owners by giving Roszel Advisors the agility and flexibility to change the subadvisers of the Replacement Portfolios should such a change become warranted or advisable.
24. MLLIC and MLNY will effect the Substitutions as soon as practicable following the issuance of the requested order as follows. As of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Effective Date”), each Separate Account will redeem shares of the applicable Substituted Portfolios in-kind. The proceeds of such redemptions will then be used to purchase shares of the corresponding Replacement Portfolios, with each subaccount of the applicable Separate Account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the Substituted Portfolios in the applicable Replacement Portfolios. Following these transactions, certain Separate Accounts may have two subaccounts holding shares of the Replacement Portfolios. Each Separate Account will combine the two subaccounts holding shares of each Replacement Portfolio by transferring shares on the same date from one of the subaccounts holding shares of the Replacement Portfolio to the other subaccount holding shares of the Replacement Portfolio. The net effect of the Substitutions will be to eliminate the subaccount in each Separate Account relating to the Substituted Portfolios.
25. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. All redemptions of shares of the Substituted Portfolios and purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios will be effected in accordance with Rule 22c-1 of the 1940 Act.
26. The Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any Variable Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in any of the subaccounts. Variable Contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions, nor will their rights or MLLIC's and MLNY's obligations under the Variable Contracts be altered in any way (although Variable Contract owners will lose their right to vote on whether the MLIG Trust and Roszel Advisors may enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements relating to the Replacement Portfolios, pursuant to the Manager of Managers Order described above). All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage commissions, will be paid by MLLIC or MLNY. In addition, the Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Variable Contract owners. The Substitutions will not cause the Variable Contract fees and charges currently paid by existing Variable Contract owners to be greater after the Substitutions than before the Substitutions. Neither MLLIC nor MLNY will exercise any right it may have under the Variable Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the Variable Contracts for a period of at least thirty days following the Substitutions. To the extent that the total operating expenses of either of the Replacement Portfolios (taking into account any expense waiver or reimbursement), for each fiscal quarter during the twenty-four months following the Substitutions, exceed on an annualized basis the net expense level of the corresponding Substituted Portfolio for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, MLLIC and MLNY will, for each Variable Contract outstanding on the date of the Substitutions, make a corresponding reduction in Separate Account expenses on the last day of such fiscal quarter, such that the amount of the Replacement Portfolio's net expenses, together with those of the corresponding Separate Account will, on an annualized basis, be no greater than the sum of the net expenses of the corresponding Substituted Portfolio and the expenses of the Separate Account for the 2002 fiscal year. In addition, for twenty-four months following the Substitutions, MLLIC and MLNY will not increase asset-based fees or charges for Variable Contracts outstanding on the day of the Substitutions. Thereafter, expenses of the Replacement Portfolios will vary from year to year and may exceed those of their corresponding Substituted Portfolios. The procedures to be implemented are sufficient to assure that each Variable Contract owner's cash values immediately after the Substitutions shall be equal to the cash value immediately before the Substitutions, and that the Substitutions will not affect the value of the interests of those owners of other MLLIC and MLNY variable contracts (other than the Variable Contracts) who currently have contract value allocated to any of the portfolios of the AllianceBernstein Fund, the Delaware Trust, the MFS Trust, or the MLIG Trust.
27. Variable Contract owners have been notified of the Application by means of a supplement to the prospectus for each of the Variable Contracts that discloses that the Applicants have filed the Application and seek approval for the Substitutions (“Pre-Substitution Notice”). The Pre-Substitution Notice set forth the anticipated Effective Date and advised Variable Contract owners that contract values attributable to investments in the Substituted Portfolios will be transferred to the Replacement Portfolios, without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers permitted without charge, on the Effective Date. The Pre-Substitution Notice stated that, from the date the initial application was filed with the Commission through the date thirty (30) days after the Substitutions, Variable Contract owners may make one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Substituted Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other subaccount without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without that transfer counting toward the number Start Printed Page 61492permitted without charge under the Variable Contract.
28. In addition, MLLIC will solicit approval of the proposed Substitutions from MLLIC Variable Contract owners and MLNY will solicit approval of the proposed Substitutions from MLNY Variable Contract owners. Such approval will be sought from the owners of First Generation MLLIC VLI Contracts, Second Generation MLLIC VLI Contracts, MLLIC Annuity Contracts, First Generation MLNY VLI Contracts, Second Generation MLNY VLI Contracts, and MLNY Annuity Contracts, each voting as a separate group. This solicitation will make clear that approval of the proposed Substitutions signifies approval of the Replacement Portfolios' reliance on the Manager of Managers Order described above. If MLLIC and MLNY do not receive approval for the Substitutions (and in effect, the Replacement Portfolios' reliance on the Manager of Managers Order) for all groups of Contracts, MLLIC and MLNY may decide to effect the Substitutions only for some or all of those groups whose owners approve them. Similarly, if MLLIC and MLNY do not receive approval for all of the Substitutions, MLLIC and MLNY may decide to effect only those Substitutions that were approved by Variable Contract owners. Neither MLLIC nor MLNY will effect any proposed Substitution for any group of Contracts that has not approved that Substitution. Approval will be obtained by the affirmative vote of the lesser of: (1) A majority of the outstanding interests in each applicable subaccount investing in the relevant Substituted Portfolio (measured by the dollar value of accumulation units), or (2) 67% of such outstanding interests voted, if votes received represent a majority of such interests. MLLIC and MLNY will solicit approval of Variable Contract owners by sending them written voting forms accompanied by a voting information statement and other disclosure documents in a manner generally consistent with applicable requirements of Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (collectively, “voting materials”). In particular, the relevant information statement will disclose, in substance, the information required by applicable items of Form N-14. Any beneficial financial interest that MLLIC or MLNY may have in any of the Separate Accounts is immaterial in relation to the interests of Variable Contract owners and neither MLLIC nor MLNY will cast any votes. Pursuant to Rule 20a-1 under the 1940 Act, the voting materials have been filed with the Commission as proxy materials. Applicants anticipate that voting materials will be sent to Variable Contract owners on October 10, 2003. Unless extended by either MLLIC or MLNY, votes must be received by November 7, 2003 to be counted.
29. All Variable Contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent Replacement Portfolio prospectuses prior to the Substitutions.
30. Finally, within five (5) days after the Substitutions, Variable Contract owners will be notified, by means of a supplement to the prospectus for each of the Variable Contracts, that the Substitutions were carried out (“Post-Substitution Notice”). The Post-Substitution Notice will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice (e.g., advising Variable Contract owners of the “free” transfer right).
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order of the Commission, if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. Section 26(c) was intended to provide for Commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions which could, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial purchase payments, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both. The section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holder's only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security, or to elect a costly and, in effect, forced redemption. The Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. In addition, the Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards that the Commission and its Staff have applied to substitutions that have been approved in the past.
3. The replacement of the Substituted Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Variable Contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act and, thus, meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. The Substitutions will provide Variable Contract owners with comparable investment vehicles.
4. Although not always identical, the investment objectives, policies, and strategies of the Replacement Portfolios are comparable to those of their respective Substituted Portfolios.
5. In each proposed Substitution, the types of investment advisory and administrative services provided to the Replacement Portfolios by their various investment advisers are comparable to the types of investment advisory and administrative services provided to the Substituted Portfolios by their respective investment advisers. Variable Contract owners invested in the Delaware VIP Trend Series (one of the Substituted Portfolios) will enjoy continuity of their investment adviser due to the “manager of managers” approach employed by Roszel Advisors, the investment adviser to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio. The Replacement Portfolio will be managed overall by Roszel Advisors, but much of the day-to-day management activity will be handled by the subadviser, DMC, the investment adviser currently managing the Delaware VIP Trend Series. While Variable Contract owners invested in the AllianceBernstein Quasar Portfolio, whose investment adviser is currently Alliance, would be managed by a new investment adviser and a new subadviser, as stated above, the types of investment advisory and administrative services provided after the Substitution will be comparable to those received before the Substitution. Similarly, the same will be true of the Substitution of shares of the Roszel/PIMCO CCM Capital Appreciation Portfolio (the Replacement Portfolio), whose investment adviser will be Roszel Advisors and whose subadvisers will be PIMCO and Cadence, for shares of the MFS Research Series and MFS Investors Trust Series, whose investment adviser is MFS.
6. Although the Delaware VIP Trend Series' advisory fee and total operating expenses are lower than those of the Roszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio (before any waivers and reimbursements), the AllianceBernstein Quasar Portfolio's advisory fee and total operating expenses are higher than those of the Roszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio (before Start Printed Page 61493any waivers and reimbursements). Moreover, the proposed Substitutions will be effected only with the approval of Variable Contract owners. Finally, MLLIC and MLNY will agree that, for two years from the date of the Substitutions, they will reduce Separate Account expenses to the extent the annualized expenses for either Replacement Portfolio for any fiscal quarter exceed the 2002 net expense level of its corresponding Substituted Portfolio. Similarly, although the advisory fee and total operating expenses of the MFS Research Series and the MFS Investors Trust Series are lower than those of the Roszel/PIMCO CCM Capital Appreciation Portfolio (before any waivers and reimbursements), MLLIC and MLNY will effect the proposed Substitutions only if Variable Contract owner approval is received. And, MLLIC and MLNY will agree that, for two years from the date of the Substitutions, they will reduce Separate Account expenses to the extent the annualized expenses for either Replacement Portfolio for any fiscal quarter exceed the 2002 net expense level of its corresponding Substituted Portfolio.
7. Although not always identical, the investment risks of the Replacement Portfolios are comparable to those of their respective Substituted Portfolios.
8. The Section 17(b) Applicants also request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit MLLIC and MLNY to carry out the Substitutions by redeeming shares issued by AllianceBernstein Fund, Delaware Trust, and MFS Trust in-kind and using the distributed securities to purchase shares issued by MLIG Trust.
9. Section 17(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company and from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company. MLLIC and MLNY anticipate that the Substitutions will be done (in whole or in part) by redeeming shares of the Substituted Portfolios in-kind rather than in cash and then using those assets to purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios. Redemptions and purchases in-kind involve the purchase of property from a registered investment company and the sale of property to a registered investment company by MLLIC, MLNY, and the MLIG Trust, each arguably an affiliated person of those investment companies.
10. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the funds involved in the Substitutions, based upon the definition of “affiliated person” under Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares, and also by means of in-kind transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
11. Any in-kind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the Substitutions will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Substituted Portfolios and the Replacement Portfolios. Subject to the oversight of Roszel Advisors, DMC will review the securities holdings of the AllianceBernstein Quasar Portfolio and the Delaware VIP Trend Series, and PIMCO and Cadence will review the securities holdings of the MFS Research Series and the MFS Investors Trust Series, and determine which of these Substituted Portfolio holdings would be suitable investments for the Roszel/Delaware Trend Portfolio and the Roszel/PIMCO CCM Capital Appreciation Portfolio, respectively, in the overall context of the Replacement Portfolios' investment objectives and policies and consistent with their management of the Replacement Portfolios. The Section 17(b) Applicants state that securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Portfolios to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued based on the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios. The redeeming and purchasing values will be the same. Consistent with Rule 17a-7(d) under the 1940 Act, no brokerage commissions, fees, or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the in-kind transactions. If Roszel Advisors declines to accept particular portfolio securities of any of the Substituted Portfolios for purchase in-kind of shares of any of the Replacement Portfolios, those positions will be liquidated by the applicable Substituted Portfolio and shares of the corresponding Replacement Portfolio will be purchased with cash.
12. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: (1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
13. The Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the Substitutions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17(b) Applicants also submit that the Substitutions are consistent with the policies of AllianceBernstein Fund, Delaware Trust, MFS Trust, and MLIG Trust, and their portfolios, as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
For purposes of the approval sought pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act, the Substitutions described in the Application will not be completed unless all of the following conditions are met.
1. The Commission shall have issued an order (i) approving the Substitutions under Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act as necessary to carry out the transactions described in the Application; and (ii) exempting any in-kind redemptions and purchases from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act as necessary to carry out the transactions described in the Application.
2. Each Variable Contract owner will have been sent (i) prior to the Effective Date, a copy of the effective prospectus relating to the relevant Replacement Portfolio, (ii) prior to the Effective Date, a Pre-Substitution Notice describing the terms of the Substitutions and the rights of the Variable Contract owners in connection with the Substitutions, and (iii) a Post-Substitution Notice within five days after the Substitutions informing them that the Substitutions were carried out and restating the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
3. MLLIC and MLNY shall have satisfied themselves that (i) the Variable Contracts allow the substitution of portfolios in the manner contemplated by the Substitutions and related Start Printed Page 61494transactions described herein, (ii) the transactions can be consummated as described in the Application under applicable insurance laws, and
(iii) that any applicable regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Variable Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the transaction.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
