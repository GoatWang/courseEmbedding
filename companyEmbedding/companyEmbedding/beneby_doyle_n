Jul 15, 2013 | Meet the Board
 

In this issue, meet Board of Trustees member Doyle N. Beneby

When Doyle N. Beneby joined the UIW Board of Trustees in 2011, it was a natural fit. The 25-year veteran of the energy industry is himself a product of a Catholic education.
“Having benefited from the educational and social experience of attending a Catholic high school, it felt natural to become involved in a Catholic institution of higher learning,” said Beneby.
Of course, it didn’t hurt that Dr. Louis Agnese, UIW president, encouraged him to join at a break- fast where Agnese welcomed him to San Antonio not long after his arrival.
“Dr. Agnese is a persuasive and dynamic individual, and frankly quite difficult to say no to,” said Beneby. “Additionally, I have a passion for contributing to education and UIW is an up and coming institution that I was delighted to be a part of.”
Since 2010, Beneby has served as president and chief executive officer of CPS Energy, the largest municipal electric and gas utility in the nation. He has led the transition to a lower carbon intense generation fleet, utilizing clean coal, natural gas and nuclear energy combined with targeted renewables such as wind and solar energy. Through the multiple partnerships he has brokered with clean technology companies, thousands of jobs have been added to the Greater San Antonio area, increasing research and development and enhancing educational investments.
“I’m very pleased that CPS Energy was able to secure $100,000 earlier this year from our New Energy Economy partners that will go to scholarships for the students of the UIW School of Mathematics, Science and Engineering. We hope to employ some of these UIW engineers one day,” said Beneby.
As a successful leader, Beneby recognizes the importance of the UIW Board in the growth of the university.
“One of the primary roles of the Board is to give advice and counsel to the president and university leadership. Additionally, the other principle role of the Board is ambassadorship and promotion of the university,” said Beneby.
Beneby describes the changes he has witnessed during his tenure on the UIW Board simply: “Growth. Growth. Growth. Diversity. Diversity. Diversity. UIW is increasingly becoming bigger, better and more accessible to students around the globe.”
Beneby holds a bachelor’s degree from Montana Technical College and a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Miami. In 2003, he completed the Advanced Management Pro- gram at Exelon Training Center. He also completed the Advanced Executive Leadership Program at Exelon Academy/Northwestern University in 2008.
He serves on numerous boards for corporate and industry organizations. He also serves on the Board of Directors for the Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce and San Antonio Medical Foundation.

Doyle N. Beneby, President and CEO          CPS Energy
Although many of you might have already heard, I’m sharing with you what I consider to be bittersweet news. I’ve recently notified our Board of Trustees of my intention to resign from my position as President and CEO, effective September 30, 2015.
It has been my privilege to lead what I consider to be the best job in public power, and to serve the community of San Antonio.
I’m very proud of the value the CPS Energy team has been able to bring to the community during my tenure as CEO.  And I’d like to thank the generous and supportive array of stakeholders and partners, including the City of San Antonio (City Manager Sheryl Sculley), Bexar County, the local Chambers of Commerce, the business community, environmental stakeholders, and various educational, non-governmental and philanthropic organizations.
It’s been an incredible journey for me and my family, and although I am grateful for the outpouring of kind words and compliments directed my way, CPS Energy and the San Antonio community have done much more for me and my family than we can ever reciprocate.
Lastly, I want to again thank the 3,200 CPS Energy employees for allowing me the honor of leading them over the past five years.
Going forward, within a few weeks, I’ll be able to share what my next career adventure will be. I also hope to stay connected in some way, to the San Antonio Community for many years to come.
With gratitude and warm regards,
Doyle
