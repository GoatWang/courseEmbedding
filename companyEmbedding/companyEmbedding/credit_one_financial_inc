Security & Fraud



                        We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We list some activities below that we perform in order to safeguard your data and some tips that you can follow to protect your security.
                    

What We Do:

We employ industry-proven standards and technologies to protect information in our computing environment.
We protect our systems and networks from the Internet with firewall systems.
We use 128-bit SSL encryption technology to protect sensitive information that is transmitted over the Internet.
We maintain a Global Digital Certificate signed by Verisign® that assures you are, in fact, communicating directly with Credit One Bank.
We control access to your information inside our company by limiting employee access to systems and data.


What You Should Do:

Protect your Username and Password. Avoid choosing easily guessed words or numbers. Avoid writing your sign in information in a place where others can view it.
Use the 'Sign Out' button to sign out from Online Account Access upon completion of your session and close your browser.
Do not use email for account-specific questions. Email is not normally encrypted and your account information could be intercepted.
Review your statement information regularly for unauthorized transactions.


Alerts Regarding Phishing and Web-Spoofing:

Phishing is an Internet scam (spoof) in the form of an email or pop-up box. The emails and pop-ups link to sites that look like well-known legitimate businesses and ask you to provide and confirm personal, financial, or password information.
Legitimate businesses do not ask for this information unless you initiate a request for a service. Please DO NOT RESPOND to these emails requesting personal identity, accounts or password information.
Scam emails often contain misspelled words, poor grammar, awkward or unprofessional writing and typos.
Be suspicious of urgent or alarming appeals that request security information.


Fraud Alerts:

Credit One Fraud Alerts messages are provided to you at no cost. You will not be charged for alerts received.
Message frequency varies, as they are only sent when there is suspicion of fraud.
Mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
For help send HELP to 89283.
Send STOP to 89283 to end future fraud alert messages.
For support contact us at 1-877-825-3242.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
