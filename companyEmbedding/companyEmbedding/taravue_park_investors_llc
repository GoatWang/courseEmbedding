David Thiemann, the St. Louis-based real estate developer specializing in apartment complex acquisitions, has raised $5.4 million through a business entity called Taravue Park Investors LLC, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Thiemann is president and CEO of Thiemann Real Estate. He previously served as executive vice president of Trammell Crow Co. for nearly 15 years.
Founded in 2001, Thiemann Real Estate invests in apartment properties and owns apartment complexes in west and south St. Louis County, the Metro East and Indiana.
The raise caps off a busy year in which Thiemann has raised nearly $30 million for his real estate interests.




Taravue Park is one of at least five apartments owned by Stone Creek Living, a business entity owned by Thiemann.
Thiemann acquired Taravue Park, located at 3975 Taravue Lane in south St. Louis County, for $14.2 million in 2007, according to St. Louis County records. The property has an appraised value of $7.9 million.

Brian Feldt covers technology, venture capital, startups, real estate and sports business.

We moved within a few weeks and loved the location and our new apartment, as with any new place we started to find something’s that needed to be fixed and the maintenance staff while not the quickest did a good job and took care of all the issues.  Going through this bad winter the staff was always out making sure the sidewalks and roads where as cleared as possible.  We have met many people in our building and we have not had any issues with other tenants fighting or loitering like others have posted.  We did have some young guys move in above us and we can hear them moving around but that happens in an apartment, we have had to ask them to turn down the music a few times but they have always said they are sorry and turned it down right away. You just have to treat people with respect and you will get back in return. We have never had any issue with our car being damaged or kids hanging around where they should not be.  We have used the dog park for our dogs and it is an old tennis court but it has been completely mulched over and there are a few things for the dogs in it but it is just a good place for them to run around and get some exercise.Park Val Apartmentsmacdaxon ratedAfter living here for a year I'd have to say there are definite pros and cons. The pros are the neighbors and maintenance staff are friendly and it is very centrally located. That is pretty much the end of the pros. The management has a snotty attitude, and poor communication skills. Haven't seen her here until recently and I am thoroughly unimpressed by the way she presents herself. They present any issue as all encompassing and leave threatening letters on your door when you have not committed the offense, under the reasoning that it is required by the DOH. The floors and ceilings are thin and you hear pretty much everything through the oven and bathroom ventilation. They will tell you the appliances are fully updated, once again not the case. Maybe in some apartments, but it wasn't so in mine. The floors in my hallway are uneven, the doors have a half inch of space open on the bottom, The entrance into the building is secured, but you don't get a code just a keybob and must let any visitors in by walking to the door. It is quite the pain when ordering delivery. My neighbors are sorry to see me go, I was sorry to go until I had a conversation with management today about having to go. Like I said very snotty with a poor attitude. My advice find somewhere else to live.Kinswood ApartmentsSteven E. ratedA few months back, during 2 days of heavy rain, my bedroom ceiling collapsed. Wet insulation, plaster and water all over my bed and floor. It happened on a Sunday afternoon, so luck was on my side this didn't happen in the middle of the night. Seeing there is no manager OR maintenance person on site, there was nothing I could do until Monday morning. Maintenance was pretty quick to fix it..............I thought. Tonight, heavy rain again. The ceiling sprung a leak just to the right where it had collapsed before. Being a late Friday night, I fear nothing can be done until Monday. I also do not want to chance sleeping in there until it's fixed. No telling how bad it is. I have to make this my last lease here. I can't take this much longer. I have lived here for a long, long time and would have rated this place much higher when I first moved here. It's been a slow decline ever since. Having no manager or maintenance on site is inexcusable and is my main reason I cannot renew my lease.Merchandise Mart ApartmentsAri D. ratedi wish their was all carpet.  The walls are tooooooooo thin.  The sinks in the 2 bedroom apartments/lofts are from the high school years.  The water in the shower gets cold after 11 minutes.  Its okay.  The people living here are afraid of their own shadow.  Horrible location.  The bus to Soulard Market has to go down Washington ave towards TUCKER and around the city, instead of directly to Soulard.  Coming from the West coast i hate it here.  We can only get Direct TV and only AT&T, but it would be much better with Charter and Dish.  iF THEIR WAS FANS IN THE BATHROOMS IN THE APARTMENTS IT WOULD BE MUCH MUCH BETTER.. takes 4 days to get a new water filter in the fridge/freezer and it was put in 1 week and 2 days before they did something about it.  They said that i never told them on Saturday to fix my problems in the loft and they said it was called in Monday, but i told them Saturday.  I had to get my parents to call in from another state to get the order done. UGH Lucas and Hunt VillageFelicia M. ratedThese apartments have pros and cons. Pros:very spacious, plenty of closet and cabinet space, hot water all the time, good access to natural light. Cons:unprofessional leasing consultants-discussed another tenant's concern in front of me,unprofessional maintenance staff-enter apartments without knocking or ringing the doorbell, maintenance do not leave a former for completed work, repair requests take forever to complete, machines need to be replaced in the laundry facilities, laundry facilities are not kept clean, hallways are not kept clean. I've been here for a year. These apartments would be more appealing and bring more profitable if the management would stay on top of their game and pay more attention to what concerned tenants are telling them.Park Pacific Apartmentstammie.voss ratedI love living at Park Pacific....I love living at Park Pacific. My apartment is beautiful and the building is amazing. My safety and a secure garage for my car was a priority. I get both here. I enjoy all of the ammenities the building has to offer like.....rooftop pool and grills, state of the art gym, clubhouse room and Wi room. The staff is great and always ready to assist me. The 24 hour doorman has come in handy on many occasions. My neighbors are polite and I never hear them. I looked at 35 different apartments downtown and this is by far yhe best apartment in downtown St.Louis.The Port Apartmentsdeeznts ratedNot great... But cheap...I lived there for 1.5 years. The place has 4 pros, and unlimited cons...  Pros- good area, maintence is quick to fix, cheap rent w/ wash/dry in unit, 21+ pool...  Cons- appliances needed to be replaced not fixed, management (rude at times, they leave by 4 m-f) just went section 8, landscaping is horrid, dog drops everywhere, parking is limited, trash is far, walls are paper thin, etc. it's not the worst place out there and it's cheap as dirt...  Honestly the best bang for the buck within 25 miles... If you can deal with the cons.West Pointe Apartmentsgooddoer ratednice and cheap friendly atmosp...nice and cheap friendly atmosphere only bad thing is maintenance comes in almost every month then if your lucky you will catch them in your apartment saying that you sent them there to check on something that is fine they come when they want or when they think you are not around a lot of people work during the day so keep the place clean and if your missing something there is no proof that You didnt loose it.Hidden Park ApartmentsSandy H. ratedManagement-greatI moved in in 2011.  At first it was ok. After i signed my first lease renewal things changed. I was not going to sign aother leasein 2013.  A new company took over at the end of 2012. Very refrashing. The new manager is a godsend. Tough but fair.  She really cleaned up the place and i feel much safer now.  A new fence went up and locks on building doors. Manager and staff are great. Benedict Estates ApartmentsAmbf P. ratedDear Cain H, your damage coast us more than your deposit which is $300, manager is always there, you wanted to talk to me to threat for bad rating or i give you the deposit, i made the maintenance and  cleaning explains all the details for you, sorry cant help any more
