©  Werner Co. All Rights Reserved.












    
Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.
