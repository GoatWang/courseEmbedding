					Full Description



The Spectranetics Corporation, incorporated on June 28, 1988, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. The Company's products are used to cross, prepare and treat arterial blockages in the heart and legs and to manage pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. The Company's geographic segments are U.S. Medical and International Medical. The Company's product offerings in U.S. Medical segment include medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system, including fiber-optic devices and non-fiber-optic products (disposables), an excimer laser system (equipment) and the service of the excimer laser system (service). The Company's products are used in multiple vascular procedures, including peripheral atherectomy, crossing arterial blockages, coronary atherectomy and thrombectomy, and the removal of cardiac lead wires from patients with pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators. Its International Medical segment is primarily engaged in distribution activities. It serves Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Puerto Rico.The Company offers its products and services in a range of categories, such as Vascular Intervention (VI); Lead Management (LM), and Laser, service, and other. The Company's portfolio of VI devices consists of laser and aspiration catheters, AngioSculpt scoring balloon catheters, support catheters, and the Stellarex drug-coated balloon (DCB) catheters. Its LM devices consist of its excimer laser sheaths, non-laser mechanical sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. The Company offers excimer laser system known as the CVX-300, which is used in various minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. The Company sells, rents and services its CVX-300 laser systems.Vascular Intervention ProductsThe Company helps physicians cross, prepare and treat clinical challenges of peripheral and coronary artery disease. It provides a portfolio of clinical solutions for conditions in peripheral artery disease (PAD), such as chronic total occlusions (CTO), in-stent restenosis (ISR) and critical limb ischemia (CLI). The Company's primary product categories for the Vascular Intervention include peripheral atherectomy, coronary atherectomy, crossing solutions and thrombus management. Peripheral atherectomy is its product line. In the periphery, laser catheters are used as an alternative to stents and other atherectomy devices. The Company's Turbo-Elite, Turbo-Tandem and Turbo-Power catheters are used to treat stenoses and occlusions within the arteries of the leg both above and below the knee.The Company's laser catheter is inserted into an artery through a small incision and then guided to the site of the blockage or lesion under x-ray guidance using conventional angioplasty tools. When the tip of the laser catheter has been placed at the site of the blockage or lesion, the physician activates the laser to ablate the lesion. Its laser generates minimal heat and is a contact ablation laser that only ablates materials within approximately 50 microns (approximately the width of a human hair) ahead of the laser tip. It is able to break down the molecular bonds of plaque, moderate calcium and thrombus into particles, which are smaller than red blood cells, without thermal damage to surrounding tissue. The Company's AngioSculpt scoring balloon catheter combines a semi-compliant balloon with a nitinol scoring element to address limitations of conventional balloon angioplasty catheters, including an occurrence of flow-limiting dissections and balloon slippage. It is used for the vessel preparation of lesions in the arteries of the leg. The AngioSculpt peripheral scoring balloon platform includes catheters of various sizes and lengths to treat PAD both above and below the knee.The coronary atherectomy product portfolio, led by the ELCA laser ablation catheter, consists of a range selection of laser catheters. The Company's approved coronary atherectomy indications include occluded saphenous vein bypass grafts, ostial lesions, long lesions, moderately calcified stenoses, total occlusions traversable by guidewire, lesions with failed balloon angioplasty, and restenosis in bare metal stents, prior to brachytherapy. In coronary market, its laser catheters are used with other devices, such as balloons and drug-eluting stents.The crossing solutions catheter products support vascular access in the arterial system to enable both coronary and peripheral interventions. Its primary crossing solutions products include the Quick-Cross, Quick-Cross Select and Quick-Cross Extreme. In the thrombus management market, the Company offers aspiration catheters to address thrombus-laden lesions. The thrombus management product line includes the QuickCat aspiration catheter.Lead Management ProductsThe Company's primary product includes Spectranetics Laser Sheaths, such as GlideLight and SLS II, which are laser-assisted lead removal devices designed to be used with its CVX-300 excimer laser system to extract implanted leads with minimal force; Lead Locking Device (LLD), which is a mechanical device that assists in the removal of leads by providing traction on the inner aspect of the leads, and Mechanical Tools, such as TightRail Rotating Dilator Sheath and SightRail Manual Dilator Sheath. Its TightRail and the SightRail mechanical lead extraction platforms expand physicians' options for managing cardiac leads.The Company competes with Medtronic, Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, C.R. Bard, Inc., QT Vascular, Biotronik, Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. and Cook Medical, Inc.

                The Spectranetics Corp. is a medical device company that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. Its products are used to treat arterial blockages in the heart and legs as well as the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads. It has two reportable segments, which were identified on a geographic basis: U.S.Medical and International Medical. These segments offer the same products and services but operate in different geographic regions, with different distribution networks and different regulatory environments. Within U.S. Medical, the company aggregates its two business units, Vascular Intervention and Lead Management. The Vascular Intervention business line manufactures and sells a range of peripheral and cardiac laser catheters for ablation of stenosed and occluded arteries above and below the knee and within coronary arteries. The Lead Management business line includes the manufacturing of excimer laser sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories, including lead locking stylets for manual traction and aid in laser-assisted extraction of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator leads. The company was founded by Robert Golobic, Johan Sverdrup and Richard T. Simko in 1984 and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO.

Why The Spectranetics Corporation Shares Burst Today
A tepid first quarter and disappointing guidance caused The Spectranetics Corporation shares to trade lower.











                Todd Campbell
            

                (TMFEBCapital)



            
            Apr 24, 2015 at 1:56PM
            
            





Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
What: Shares in The Spectranetics Corporation (NASDAQ:SPNC) tumbled by more than 20% earlier today after the company reported disappointing first quarter earnings after the bell yesterday. 
So What: The maker of medical devices used in cardiovascular procedures reported sales of $57.4 million during the first quarter. The company also reported an adjusted net loss of $0.30 per share.
Although sales grew 45% from last year, the company's adjusted net loss was worse than the loss of $0.13 reported a year ago due to costs associated with new products. Revenue and earnings per share also missed analyst estimates by $2.8 million and $0.07, respectively.
Additionally, The Spectranetics Corporation issued guidance that was disappointing.





The company kept its forecast for sales growth of between 26% and 29% this year unchanged, but admitted that it's more likely that growth will trend toward the low end of this range.
Its earnings guidance was even less inspiring. The company estimates that its net loss will be within a range of $78 million to $82 million, and that's worse than its prior estimate for a loss of between $58 million and $62 million.
Now What: The company's conservative sales forecast stems from increasing competition tied to the launch of new products that are vying for share against The Spectranetics Corporation's AngioSculpt.
Those introductions have led to the company reducing the low end of its outlook for AngioSculpt revenue from a forecast of between $62 million and $66 million this year to a range of between $59 million and $66 million this year.





Lower AngioSculpt sales and increased spending tied to the acquisition and integration of the Stellarex program, which was acquired from Covidien last fall, are behind the company's lowered profit guidance.
Overall, while patient demographics should support demand for cardiovascular procedures for years to come, investors may want to wait to see how the competitive picture develops and for the Stellarex headwinds to abate before stepping in and buying shares.

Philips Buys Medical Device Maker Spectranetics Corp.; Deal Has Enterprise Value of $2.15 Billion









Martin Baccardax




Armie Margaret Lee



Jun 28, 2017 4:29 AM EDT













 












































































 Royal Philips NV  (PHG) said Wednesday that it will buy medical devices maker Spectranetics Corporation  (SPNC) in a deal that carries an enterprise value of around €1.9 billion. Philips will pay $38.50 per share for Colorado Springs, Co.-based Spectranetics, a 26.6% premium to the $30.40 closing price the shares reached yesterday in New York that gave the group a market capitalisation of $1.326 billion. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, Philips said, and has been approved and recommended by the Spectranetics board. In a note on Wednesday, Canaccord Genuity Inc. analyst Jason Mills said the deal marks a 7.2 times enterprise value to sales multiple relative to Canaccord's 2017 revenue estimate for Spectranetics. "By contrast, med-tech companies growing at a forward 2-year CAGR of at least 15% are trading at 7.4x 2017E," wrote Mills, who has a buy rating on Spectranetics' stock. The forward two-year CAGR estimate for Spectranetics in Canaccord's model is 16%. Mills views Stellarex as the coveted asset in the transaction. The Stellarex drug-coated balloon is a therapeutic device for the treatment of peripheral artery disease. It is Conformite Europeene (CE)-marked and under review by the Food and Drug Administration for premarket approval in the U.S. Shares of Spectranetics were trading at $38.38, up 26.2%, on Wednesday. Philips' American depository receipts were changing hands at $36.33, down 0.8% For Philips, the acquisition is expected be revenue growth and profit accretive by 2018, said CEO Frans van Houten in a statement. "Spectranetics' highly competitive product range, integrated with our portfolio of interventional imaging systems, devices, software and services will enable clinicians to decide, guide, treat and confirm the appropriate cardiac and peripheral vascular treatment to deliver enhanced care for patients with better outcomes, as well as significantly boost recurring revenue streams for Philips," van Houten said. Spectranetics is expected to generate around $300 in sales this year, Philips said, and described the company as a "leader in vascular intervention to treat coronary and peripheral artery disease, and in lead management for the minimally invasive removal of implanted pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) leads." When the deal closes, Spectranetics will become part of Philips' image-guided therapy unit.

Spectranetics Announces FDA Approval of Stellarex™ Drug-Coated Balloon
Stellarex produces top-tier clinical outcomes with a low drug dosage



















July 26, 2017 16:30 ET

 | Source: The Spectranetics Corporation






COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Spectranetics Corporation (NASDAQ:SPNC) today announced receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pre-Market Approval (PMA) of the Stellarex™ drug-coated balloon (DCB), designed to restore and maintain blood flow to the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). “The Stellarex DCB has shown safety and efficacy in a cohort of patients which included a higher preponderance of diabetics and core-lab defined severely calcified lesions in the US IDE trial. These results, in combination with the cohort of patients studied in the European Randomized Controlled Trial, demonstrate the Stellarex DCB is safe and effective in diverse patient populations when addressing symptomatic femoropopliteal disease,” stated Dr. Prakash Krishnan, ILLUMENATE Pivotal Trial’s Co-Principal Investigator, Mount Sinai in New York. Dr. Sean Lyden, ILLUMENATE Pivotal Trial’s Co-Principal Investigator, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio added, “The ILLUMENATE Pivotal Trial treated a challenging patient population with a low paclitaxel drug dose.  When considering options, I think most clinicians would prefer to use a lower drug dose if they can also achieve great patency results.” Throughout the ILLUMENATE Trial Series, Stellarex DCB’s EnduraCoat™ Technology demonstrates both safety and efficacy with consistently high patency rates and low clinically driven target lesion revascularization rates in a range of lesion complexities and patient co-morbidities. The device offers both hybrid paclitaxel crystallinity and a durable excipient to provide efficient drug transfer, effective drug residency with high coating durability and minimal particulate loss. “The Stellarex DCB delivers top-tier clinical results for common to complex patients. As the only commercially available DCB with two reported randomized controlled trials, Stellarex has demonstrated durability with consistently high patency rates in a wide range of patients," said Scott Drake, President and CEO, Spectranetics. "Our customers refer to Stellarex as a no-compromise solution. This next generation DCB provides proven treatment backed by robust clinical evidence.” “Spectranetics is a provider of proven solutions to manage the challenges of crossing lesions, preparing vessels, and treating even the most complex coronary and peripheral lesion morphologies. We are always focused on better patient care, and with today’s FDA approval, the Stellarex DCB becomes a formidable competitor in the drug-coated balloon market, and a proven solution for those suffering with PAD,” said Scott Hutton, Sr. Vice President & General Manager, Spectranetics. The Stellarex DCB enhances Spectranetics’ diversified suite of clinical solutions to treat complex cardiovascular conditions and expands its market opportunity in the projected $1 billion DCB global market. About the ILLUMENATE Clinical Program There are five ILLUMENATE clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Stellarex DCB platform and supporting United States regulatory filings: The ILLUMENATE EU Randomized Study is a prospective, randomized controlled, multi-center trial with 328 patients.  The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints at 12 months were met and superiority over PTA was demonstrated in both.  The 12-month primary patency rate was 83.9% (188/224) in the Stellarex arm vs. 60.6% (40/66) in the PTA arm (P<0.001), per Kaplan Meier (KM) estimate the patency rate at day 365 was 89.0% vs. 65.0%, respectively (log-rank p<0.001).The ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study is a prospective, randomized controlled, multi-center trial with 300 patients enrolled.  The cohorts were well match and included a preponderance of patients with diabetes (50%) and severely calcified lesions (44%). The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints at 12 months were met and superiority over PTA was demonstrated in both.  The primary patency rate was significantly higher in the Stellarex group at 76.3% (135/177) vs. 57.6% (53/92) for PTA (p=0.003). The 12-month primary patency rate, per KM estimate at day 365 was 82.3% in the DCB arm vs. 70.9% in the PTA arm (p=0.002).The ILLUMENATE Global Study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study with 371 patients enrolled. The 12-month primary patency rate was 81.4% per KM estimate.The ILLUMENATE First-In-Human (FIH) Study was a non-randomized, multi-center study that enrolled 80 patients. In the pre-dilatation arm (n=50), the primary patency rate per KM estimate was 89.5% at 12 months and 80.3% at 24 months.The ILLUMENATE Pharmacokinetic Study measured the paclitaxel drug levels in the blood of 25 patients and showed all patients had detectable paclitaxel levels after DCB deployment that declined rapidly within the first hour (54.4±116.9 ng/mL to 1.4±1.0 ng/mL).

Spectranetics' stock tops most-actives list after buyout deal
Shares of Spectranetics Corp.  rocketed 26% to record territory in very-active morning trade Wednesday, after the medical device maker agreed to be acquired by Royal Philips NV in a deal valued at about $2.15 billion. Volume topped 12.5 million shares about 10 minutes after the open, compared with the full-day average of about 460,000 shares, and enough to make it the most actively trade stock on major U.S. exchanges. The stock traded 5.2% above the previous record close of $36.44 on March 18, 2015. Spectranetics' stock had run up 24.0% year to date through Tuesday, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF  had climbed 15.5% and the S&P 500  had gained 8.1%.

Spectranetics Corp.


            
            The Spectranetics Corp. is a medical device company that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. Its products are used to treat arterial blockages in the heart and legs as well as the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads. It has two reportable segments, which were identified on a geographic basis: U.S.Medical and International Medical. These segments offer the same products and services but operate in different geographic regions, with different distribution networks and different regulatory environments. Within U.S. Medical, the company aggregates its two business units, Vascular Intervention and Lead Management. The Vascular Intervention business line manufactures and sells a range of peripheral and cardiac laser catheters for ablation of stenosed and occluded arteries above and below the knee and within coronary arteries. The Lead Management business line includes the manufacturing of excimer laser sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories, including lead locking stylets for manual traction and aid in laser-assisted extraction of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator leads. The company was founded by Robert Golobic, Johan Sverdrup and Richard T. Simko in 1984 and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
