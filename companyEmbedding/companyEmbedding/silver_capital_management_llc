Silverpath Capital Management LLC is an investment management firm with a primary focus on investment opportunities in real asset securities including real estate, infrastructure, energy and natural resources. 







A real asset strategy provides exposure to the key benefits of these types of tangible assets which typically include low beta equity return potential, stability of longer term contractual income and cash flow, monopolistic qualities with competitive advantages, partial inflation hedging, and low correlation to traditional securities. 





The firm’s long/short equity strategy is designed to provide attractive absolute returns with below market volatility. The investment philosophy and process combine a value style driven by thorough fundamental research and a portfolio construction approach designed to reduce volatility and correlation to other asset classes.





The principals of Silverpath Capital Management LLC are Nicholas D. Tannura and Krista B. McLeod. Mr. Tannura is a 25-year industry veteran investment manager with significant public and private market experience. His real asset securities expertise dates back to the early development of the real estate investment trust (REIT) market in the late 1980s and most recently included the ownership and management of a successful real estate and infrastructure securities business that was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management in 2007. Mr. Tannura was the Chief Executive Officer of this business until his departure from Brookfield at the end of 2011.He has been a key executive in the development and growth of a number of successful investment management businesses over the years, including KG Redding, European Investors and ING Realty Partners. Mr. Tannura is a Certified Public Accountant and received his BBA from Loyola University in 1982 and his MBA in International Finance from the University of Chicago in 1990.

Ms. McLeod was most recently the Global Head of Client Service for Brookfield Investment Management Inc., a firm focused on real asset securities with assets under management in excess of $10 billion as of December 31, 2013. She has more than 10 years of investment experience, including significant involvement with hedge fund oversight, reporting and management. Prior to joining Brookfield in 2009, Ms. McLeod was a credit analyst with BNP Paribas as part of the Energy, Commodities, Export and Project team. Ms. McLeod has been a CFA charterholder since 2007 and currently serves on the board of Women Investment Professionals. She received her JD and MBA from the University of Toronto in 2001.
