He currently serves as the President/CEO of Bundled Builder Solutions, Inc. a unique company focused on delivering a turn-key green solution for building and development projects. The BBSI corporation focuses on the coordination of all aspects of the system from "dirt to delivery" i.e. civil engineering, architecture, land development, purchasing, construction, warranty, and maintenance….serving land owners, homebuilders, building owners, and investors.  Formerly, he served as the founder and president of Execution, Inc., a company focused on effective job site organization and communication. Paul was also a partner in Integrated Stucco, LLC with long-time friend and business associate Garth Wieger. Paul grew the company to over $52 million in sales within the first six months of opening the doors. As personnel increased from 24 to over 700 craftsmen, an offer to purchase the company was accepted and Paul took the position of the Executive Vice President / General Manager for a subsequent 12 month transition period.  Before forming Integrated Stucco, Paul served as the Vice President of Construction for Shea Homes Arizona, one of the largest home builders in Phoenix. He joined Shea in 1992 as a superintendent and moved into the position of Trade and Training Advisor in 1994. He was promoted to Vice President of Construction in 1999. Under his leadership from 1999 through 2004, Shea built over 7,800 homes producing revenues close to $2 billion. But it was his participation in helping execute the smooth integration process when Shea acquired UDC Homes, a transaction in excess of $400,000,000 in the late 1990's, which is the capstone of his career at Shea.

"Thank you for the excellent

															have very much appreciated promptness and flexibility"

														Dick Stott - CalEd Software, Carmel, CA
													








"I hired Dynamic Ventures after 
															getting frustrated with my in-house staff of 2 programmers. My staff had worked 
															on our software for about 9 months with little results. Within 2 weeks of 
															hiring Dynamic Ventures our software was well on its way to becoming a first 
															class product. Needless to say, Dynamic Ventures was soon the only staff that I 
															needed.

															I would also credit Dynamic Ventures for producing a world class product not 
															only in half the time that I expected but also of such quality that a fortune 
															500 company soon purchased our company specifically for this software product."

														Scott Groff - Former CEO, founder and inventor of VARS Video Imaging System, 
														San Jose, CA
													








"When Digital Fountain was in 
															the incubation stage, Yitzchak (Itzak) Ehrlich of Dynamic Ventures helped us to 
															develop a prototype of our technology.  His help contributed to our 
															ability to obtain VC funding."

														Michael Luby, PhD - Co-Founder and CTO, Digital Fountain,
														Fremont, CA
													








"Under contract, Dynamic 
															Ventures (DV) designed and developed the initial release of our PC-based 
															software product, a management system for dental images and dental records. 
															They worked with our management and engineering team as well as our domain 
															experts in the initial stages of product design to understand the needs and 
															requirements of the new product. By involving our internal team in an iterative 
															design approach with formal reviews, we ended up with a product that was of 
															very high quality.

															We currently have sold over 800 copies of the software to dental offices around 
															the US and we are still going strong. We have successfully released five major 
															updates of the product, while retaining the core database and user-interface 
															developed in the initial release. I would highly recommend Dynamic Ventures for 
															any company seeking a quality outsourced alternative for product design and 
															development."

Addressing your Real Needs with a Proven Agile Software 
														Development Process
													





































How Our Methodology 
																		Benefits You







Faster development time
																	 so you can get to market ahead of your competition.
																






Lower overall cost  so you can 
																	meet your budget needs and keep overhead down.
																






Focus on the right solution
																	 so you get exactly what you need and want.
																






A minimum of your time  so you 
																	can be part of the development process, without taking too much time away from 
																	your business.
																









Steps to Software 
																		Success:
																		How We Work with You







We brainstorm with you 
																	to understand your goals for the software.
																






We create an initial proof of concept 
																		prototype.







We evolve and adjust the prototype 
																		through multiple iterations in a series of milestones -- based on 
																	feedback from you and other stakeholders.
																






We get closer to your final goals
																	with each iteration and milestone.
																






We refactor the code and 
																		architecture throughout the entire lifecycle of the project to improve 
																	and streamline internal structure.
																






We make you part of the development team
																	through short brainstorming sessions  along with using and testing the 
																	evolving prototype  without taking up too much of your time.
																






We deliver a final core software product 
																		that meets your highest expectations, along with your schedule and budget.
																






To consistently help our clients achieve 
														the results they want, we employ an agile methodology for building and 
														maintaining high-quality software products. This process has proven itself in 
														numerous successful releases to the market.
														

Our iterative evolving milestones methodology helps us identify your true 
															needs and address your most important real-world issues. It starts 
														wherever you are right now  with an idea, a concept or a short problem 
														description. Then, we gradually build your software in a series of milestones 
														to create working prototypes.
														

At each milestone, we enhance and refine the software based on feedback and 
															input from you (the client), stakeholders and developers -- along with 
														the results of testing and diagnostics code. This approach results in better 
														end products that adapt to changing specifications and meet your overall 
														expectations.
														

A key aspect of our methodology is refactoring to save time and raise quality.
														Throughout the life cycle of each project, we continually refactor the code and 
														architecture to optimize and streamline the softwares internal structure. This 
														simplifies the code to ensure flexible architecture and infrastructure for easy 
														evolution of the software.
														

Above all, our methodology enables you to clearly understand what is being 
															developed at each milestone of the project. You can provide meaningful 
														feedback every step of the way to be an integral part of the development team  
														without taking up too much of your time.

The challenge now will be getting favorable weather to get the project started, but once that occurs we will be running hard and fast.”  Dean Dovolis, founder of DJR-Architecture and lead principal of Annabelle Homes stated, “This is a 50 year commitment by the communities. We are not just building houses here, but taking the time to build a long lasting legacy that benefits the entire population base.”  Paul Kalkbrenner continued, “During the construction phase, we expect to hire 50 construction workers in the area and anticipate that this project will be completed around late September.”  About Dynamic Ventures  Dynamic Ventures Corporation develops and markets efficient construction solutions for residential and commercial buildings. The company offers a turnkey solution enabling the firm to custom design, manufacture and install complete LEED certified structures.
