Product Details

				Offering a full set of rear horizontals and heavy-duty internal spreaders, this stepladder is ideal for the homeowner or the professional. It has a lock-in system to secure tools from falling while keeping them right at hand. The bracing system helps protect the rails from damage. Each knee-braced step is slip resistant and double riveted. The fiberglass rails are nonconductive for working near electricity. Back-up plates reinforce all top connectors.

              can I buy a replacement front left leg, and rivits for a 6205                     when I say front left I mean the smaller leg not the ones the steps are attached to.         Asked by: Anonymous             You can buy new feet, the rails are not available            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-05-22                Size and accessories                     I'm 5' 6&quot; tall. My ceilings are 8'

If, for example, I want to hand paint the wall at ceiling height #8'#, and want to be comfortable with balance, is the 5' ladder the correct one.

Also, as I would like to paint with a roller tray while on the ladder, how can I mount the tray to the ladder so I can use it while on the ladder steps?

Thank You, Nelson         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6205 step ladder has a maximum reach height of 9 feet.

A roller tray can be used to by attaching this to the two slots on the front face of the plastic ladder top.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2013-10-22                can I buy a replacement top piece for a 6208 ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             Yes the top of the 6208 ladder is replaceable. In order to determine which top will fit your model of ladder, we would also need the mark number (MK) on the ladder. This number can be found on the duty rating on the side rail of the ladder. If your MK is 12,13,14,15,16, or 17, you would need to order the 38-31. If your MK is 18 you would nee 38-32. If the MK on your ladder is not one of the MK's I have listed above, then we do not have a top for your model of ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-07-17                Replacement Labels                     Hi,

I work in an educational environment and have a ladder like the one shown. I noticed the labels are worn off on my ladder. I like my department (IT Dept.) compliant with OSHA. Does Werner distribute replacement labels? If so, how would I obtain these? Thank you for any help you can give.

Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-10-05                What is the warrantee on this ladder?                     What is the time and coverage if it has a warrantee at all , as I can find no reference to one anywhere?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does not offer a written or implied warranty on its products. We do stand behind the quality and workmanship of our models.

Asked by: Anonymous             As defined by OSHA standards, the 6202 is a fiberglass step stool. Step stools are designed to be climbed on the ladder top cap as well as all step.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.

Thank you for your feedback.
If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Building SuppliesWhen building, no matter how small or supersized the structure, if the supplies and tools used in the construction aren't right the building isn't going to turn out to be the monument expected. Instead, it'll only display a shoddiness that might just be unsafe. Because of this, don't cut corners during the planning process. Have the right items, from flooring materials to attic vents, and build better.

Amazon.com's Building Supplies Store has those products every contractor and builder needs, starting with the essential building materials for a variety of spaces: ceiling medallions, ceramic tiles, glass tiles and stone tiles, corbels, flooring materials, moldings and trims, exterior doors, fence post caps, gutter parts and accessories, wood flooring, and attic vents. Moving from materials to constructing, don't forget the necessary rough plumbing items like food disposers, water heaters, water pumps, and toilet parts, electrical essentials and tools like dimmers, door chimes and bells, extension cords, tools and testers, power strips, recessed lighting, switches and outlets, and wall plates, and weather vanes.

There's no need when thinking about moving materials to stress about the bodily wear and tear, however, because we offer handling products, too, such as dollies, drywall lifts, forklifts, hand trucks, lifting straps, lift tables, pallet trucks, pallets, platform trucks, roller stands, service carts, tie-downs, and winches, hoists, and pulleys. And for reaching those second floor and elevated building situations, don't show up without a reliable stepladder, extension ladder, emergency ladder, telescoping ladder, or multiple ladders, and for longer term jobs, some sturdy scaffolding.

In the same way that using weak materials or unhelpful tools is a sure step towards disaster, using a less-than-dependable brand is a bad idea. Shop top brands like 2x4basics, 3M, Cramer, Filtrete, Honeywell, JET, Kidde, Louisville Ladder, Lux, Magna Cart, and Werner and start building with a leg already up. You'll also find a wide range of deals and special offers on building materials and supplies in the Value Center. There won't be a building job in the world you'll back down from finishing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
