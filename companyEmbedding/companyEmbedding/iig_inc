IIG Products



Perlite








                Sproule WR-1200™ is a molded, high-temperature pipe & block insulation with exceptional corrosion inhibiting properties. Specifiers to the industrial processing & power generating industries recognize that stainless steel piping is highly susceptible to stress corrosion cracking at temperatures over 140°F. IIG’s intelligent insulation solution is an expanded perlite product with a binder of sodium silicate, an excellent corrosion inhibitor. Combined with a resistance to water absorption, Sproule WR-1200™ perlite effectively minimizes corrosion while providing excellent thermal insulation.
            


             
        



Thermo-12® Gold Calcium Silicate Pipe Covering by IIG






            Thermo-12® Gold from IIG is a molded, high temperature, abuse-resistant pipe insulation with exceptional structural strength, composed of hydrous calcium silicate for use on systems operating up to 1200°F (649°C). Because of its strength, low thermal conductivity and durability, Thermo-12® Gold is the preferred product for application on high temperature piping and equipment. Thermo-12® Gold is especially recommended for use in the petrochemical and power generation industries where pipe and equipment operates up to 1200°F (649°C).









Thermo-12® Gold Calcium Silicate Block by IIG






            Thermo-12® Gold from IIG is a molded, high temperature, abuse-resistant  calcium silicate block insulation with exceptional structural strength, composed of hydrous calcium silicate for use on systems operating up to 1200°F (649°C). The gold color provides positive identification that it is asbestos-free. Thermo-12® Gold meets or exceeds the physical property requirements of ASTM C 533, Type I. Because of its strength, low thermal conductivity and durability, Thermo-12® Gold is the preferred product for application on high temperature equipment. Thermo-12® Gold is especially recommended for use in the petrochemical and power generation industries where equipment operates up to 1200°F (649°C).









Mineral Wool Pipe Covering






            Mineral Wool Pipe Insulation provides excellent thermal insulation performance for mechanical/power and process piping systems operating from sub-ambient to 1200°F (649°C). IIG Min-Wool 1200 molded pipe insulation is easily fabricated, cutting cleanly and easily with a knife. Very low in-service shrinkage helps prevent gaps from forming at joints, preventing costly thermal leaks. The insulation is designed to be field-jacketed.









Mineral Wool Board






            IIG Mineral Wool Industrial Board Insulation is made of inorganic fibers derived from basalt, a volcanic rock, with a thermosetting resin binder. Advanced manufacturing technology ensures consistent product quality, with high fiber density and low shot content, for excellent performance in high temperature thermal control and fire resistance applications.









Mineral Wool Blanket






            Good thermal conductivity values help maximize control of heat loss, contributing to reduced operating costs and greater energy savings. High dimensional stability and low shrinkage reduce the potential for gaps forming at joints. IIG Mineral Wool Blanket insulations are semi-rigid to rigid and they maintain structural integrity under severe operating conditions. Thickness stays uniform facilitating the installation of the metal jacket.
