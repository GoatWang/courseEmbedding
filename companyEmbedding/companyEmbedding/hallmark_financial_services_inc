Hallmark Financial Services, Inc., incorporated on May 19, 1987, is an insurance holding company. The Company is engaged in the sale of property/casualty insurance products to businesses and individuals. Its business involves marketing, distributing, underwriting and servicing insurance products, as well as providing other insurance related services. The Company's segments include Standard Commercial Segment, Specialty Commercial Segment and Personal Segment. The Company markets, distributes, underwrites and services its property/casualty insurance products. The Company's Standard Commercial P&C operating unit primarily underwrites low-severity, short-tailed commercial property/casualty insurance products in the standard market. The Company reinsures a portion of the risk it underwrites in order to control the exposure to losses and to protect capital resources.Standard Commercial SegmentThe Company's standard commercial property and casualty (P&C) business unit markets, underwrites and services standard commercial lines insurance primarily in the non-urban areas of Texas, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Washington, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Hawaii and Missouri. The subsidiaries in the Standard Commercial P&C business unit include American Hallmark Insurance Services, a regional managing general agency, and Effective Claims Management, Inc., a claims administration company. American Hallmark Insurance Services targets customers that are in low-severity classifications in the standard commercial market. Products offered by Standard Commercial P&C business unit include commercial automobile, general liability, umbrella, commercial property, commercial multi-peril, business owner's and occupational accident.The Company's commercial automobile insurance provides third-party bodily injury and property damage coverage and first-party property damage coverage against losses resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in connection with an insured's business. General liability insurance provides coverage for third-party bodily injury and property damage claims arising from accidents occurring on the insured's premises or from their general business operations. Umbrella insurance provides coverage for third-party liability claims where the loss amount exceeds coverage limits provided by the insured's underlying general liability and commercial automobile policies. Commercial property insurance provides first-party coverage for the insured's real property, business personal property, and business interruption losses caused by fire, wind, hail, water damage, theft, vandalism and other insured perils. Commercial multi-peril insurance provides a combination of property and liability coverage that can include commercial automobile coverage on a single policy. Business owner's insurance provides a package of coverage designed for small to midsize businesses with homogeneous risk profiles and coverage includes general liability, commercial property and commercial automobile.

The Company's MGA Commercial Products operating unit primarily offers commercial property/casualty insurance products in the excess and surplus lines market. The MGA Commercial Products operating unit focuses on middle market commercial risks that do not meet the underwriting requirements of standard insurers due to factors, such as loss history, number of years in business, minimum premium size and types of business operation. The MGA Commercial Products operating unit primarily writes commercial automobile, general liability, commercial property and excess casualty. The MGA Commercial Products operating unit markets its products in approximately 30 states through over nine wholesale brokers, a program underwriter and approximately 90 general agency offices, as well as over 110 independent retail agents in Texas and Oregon.The Company's Specialty Commercial operating unit offers small and middle market commercial excess liability, umbrella and general liability insurance on both an admitted and non-admitted basis; general aviation property/casualty insurance primarily for private and small commercial aircraft and airports; satellite launch property/casualty insurance products; medical professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis; and primary/excess commercial property coverages on an excess and surplus lines basis for both catastrophe and non-catastrophe exposures. The principal focus of the excess and umbrella insurance products offered is transportation (trucking for hire and specialty automobile coverage). The Specialty Commercial operating unit also provides excess liability coverage for small to midsize businesses in class categories, such as contracting, manufacturing, hospitality and service (non-transportation). The Company's Specialty Personal Lines operating unit offers non-standard personal automobile policies, which provide the minimum limits of liability coverage mandated by state law to drivers. Its Specialty Personal Lines operating unit also provides a renters insurance product that complements its non-standard auto offering.

Hallmark Financial Services, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended Mar. 31, 2017
May 9 17
Hallmark Financial Services, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended Mar. 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Hallmark's total revenues were $96.9 million, representing an increase of 8% from the $90.0 million in total revenues for the same period of 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Hallmark's income before tax was $5.8 million, representing a decrease of $0.2 million from the $6.0 million reported during the same period the prior year. The increase in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to net realized gains on the Company's investment portfolio during the current quarter as compared to net realized losses during the same period the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in Revenues were higher net premiums earned and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower finance charge revenue and lower commission and fee revenue. The higher net premiums earned were due mostly to increased premium production in the Specialty Commercial Segment. The decrease in income before tax for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was due primarily to increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of $6.4 million and higher operating expenses of $0.6 million, partially offset by the increase in revenue. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Hallmark's cash flow provided by operations was $8.8 million compared to cash flow used by operations of $1.3 million during the same period the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to decreased paid losses (including timing of reinsurance claim settlements), increased net collected premiums, higher collected net investment income and lower income taxes paid partially offset by higher paid operating expenses and lower collected finance charges.
