Tableau Software Appoints Brooke Seawell to Board of Directors Company Expands Leadership Team During Period of Rapid Growth and ExpansionPublish Date: February 22, 2012 - 9:00pmTableau Software, the leader in rapid-fire business intelligence, today announced that it has appointed Brooke Seawell to its Board of Directors. In addition, he becomes chairman of Tableau’s audit committee. Seawell serves on the boards of Informatica Corporation (NASDAQ:  INFA) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). As a long-time software executive including positions at NetDynamics and Synopsys, he brings extensive experience in public company finance, accounting, governance and technology company operations.
“Tableau has an opportunity to bring business intelligence technology out of the dark cellar it has been living in for decades and use it to positively impact people’s lives,” said Christian Chabot, CEO and co-founder of Tableau Software. “We’re bringing fast and easy analytics to customers worldwide. Adding Brooke’s experience and talent to our Board will help us drive the company to the next level.” 
“Tableau is growing and innovating at such a rapid pace, it’s changing the landscape of business analytics,” said Seawell. “It has the right team in place and will be well positioned to go public when the timing and climate are appropriate.”
Seawell serves on the Management Board of the Stanford Business School. He holds an M.B.A. and B.A. from Stanford.
Tableau has also been building out its management team. Last fall, Jay Peir joined as its vice president of corporate development. Peir spent the past nine years at SunPower Corporation where he led their IPO preparations. Tableau also recently brought Keenan Conder on board as vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary. Conder has an extensive history in high growth public companies including Isilon Systems and Expedia.     
Tableau was spun out of Stanford in 2003 when Chabot, Chris Stolte and Pat Hanrahan realized that computer graphics could deliver huge gains in people’s ability to understand information. The company has had eight straight years of record growth, recently announcing that bookings grew 94 percent in 2011. In 2011, Tableau was named by Gartner and IDC as the world’s fastest growing business intelligence company.

He was also the chief technology officer and co-founder of BeeLine Software (acquired by Vicinity Corporation) and is co-inventor on five software patents related to information visualization.
•Pat Hanrahan, chief scientist and co-founder – In addition to his roles as co-founder, Tableau’s chief scientist and Stolte’s advisor at Stanford University, Hanrahan is the CANON USA professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford. He was a founding employee of Pixar (NASDAQ: PIXR) where he was the chief architect of the RenderMan™ Interface. Hanrahan is the winner of two Academy Awards and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
•Tom Walker, chief financial officer – Walker is responsible for finance and operations. He brings more than 17 years of experience across private and public companies. Previous positions include Time Warner and IDC Books (acquired by John Wiley and Sons). 
•Kelly Wright, executive vice president of sales – Wright leads worldwide sales with 20 years of experience in sales leadership sales roles. She previously held a vice president position at At Hoc and sales management positions at Southwestern, Inc., Dale Carnegie and Bank of America. 
•Elissa Fink, chief marketing officer – Fink leads all marketing for Tableau. Her 20+ year career in marketing includes senior and executive positions at IXI Corporation (acquired by Equifax), Tele Atlas (acquired by TomTom), TopTier Software (acquired by SAP) and Nielsen/Claritas.

      Brooke Seawell Joins Malwarebytes Board of Directors
    



Seawell brings more than 30 years of finance, operations and board 
      leadership






April 11, 2016 08:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Malwarebytes™, the leading advanced malware prevention and remediation 
      solution, today announced the appointment of Brooke Seawell to the 
      Malwarebytes Board of Directors.
    


      “Brooke is a recognized leader and sought-after advisor in the financial 
      industry and we are excited to welcome him to the Malwarebytes board of 
      directors,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO, Malwarebytes. “His strong 
      experience, especially in M&A and initial public offerings, will be 
      extremely valuable as Malwarebytes continues to expand globally.”
    

      Seawell brings 30-plus years’ experience in technology finance and 
      operations. As a founder, officer, investor and director, he has been 
      involved in 10 IPOs including Informatica, NVIDIA, Synopsys and Tableau 
      Software and nine strategic acquisitions including CoWare (acquired by 
      Synopsys), Informatica (acquired by Permira), NetDynamics (acquired by 
      Sun Microsystems) and TimesTen (acquired by Oracle).
    

      Seawell has extensive finance experience with his current role as 
      venture partner for NEA. Prior to this role, he was a partner with 
      Technology Crossover Ventures and EVP of NetDynamics. From 1991 to 1997, 
      he was senior vice president, finance and operations and CFO of 
      Synopsys, an electronic design automation software company, which he 
      took public in 1992. During his tenure at Synopsys, revenue grew from 
      $20 million to $500 million.
    

      “I’m excited to be part of a young and disruptive company with a 
      compelling value proposition and an executive team with the right acumen 
      to execute on it,” said Brooke Seawell, venture partner, NEA. 
      “Malwarebytes’ offering has evolved well beyond remediation to a 
      security platform that incorporates remediation, anti-malware, 
      anti-exploit, and anti-ransomware - and this is just the beginning. I 
      look forward to being an integral part of the next chapter and helping 
      Malwarebytes compete globally with a full-blown security platform.”
    

      Seawell currently serves on the board of directors of NVIDIA, Tableau 
      Software, Lithium Technologies and SugarCRM. He also served on the 
      management board of the Stanford Business School from 2008-2012 and 
      currently serves on the Stanford Athletic Board.
    

      Seawell received his MBA and BA from Stanford University.
