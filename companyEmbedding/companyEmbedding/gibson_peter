 Frampton’s Custom Comes AlivePeter Frampton Les Paul














10.0
Rating



Peter Frampton Les Paul
After paying his dues with Humble Pie and years of solo touring and recording in the late ’60s and ’70s, young British guitar star Peter Frampton hit it huge in 1976 with the release of Frampton Comes Alive, the biggest selling live album of all time. And as every one of the more than 10 million fans who bought it in its first year of release alone could tell you, you only needed to fold down that double-album cover to see Frampton wailing on a black, three-pickup Les Paul Custom. Players by the score ran out in search of their own version of that Les Paul Custom, the instrument in Frampton’s hands widely assumed to be an original 1960 model, but its origins, and its journey to the star’s hands (and out of them once again), reveal some unusual twists and turns. During the first night of a three-night stand in 1970 opening for the Grateful Dead at the Fillmore West in San Francisco while still playing with Humble Pie, Frampton was having trouble with howling feedback from his semi-hollowbody guitar on the big stage. A fan named Mark Mariana approached him after his set on the second night, said he’d noticed the hassles the guitarist was having, and provided a solution: if he wanted to, Frampton could play Mariana’s solidbody Les Paul Custom for the third night at the Fillmore. He delivered the instrument, which looked for all the world like a 1960 Custom, but was in fact a 1954 Custom freshly back from the Gibson factory, where it had been given a new coat of ebony black lacquer, new frets, and three humbucking pickups to update it to contemporary specs. Frampton bonded with the guitar instantly. It not only cured his feedback problems for the closing night of the run, it proved the most tuneful, expressive guitar Frampton had ever played. When he offered to buy it after the set, Mariana said that, no, he wouldn’t sell it—he would give it to Frampton. And through that unprecedented act of generosity, a re-born 1954 Les Paul Custom became one of the most iconic guitars of the decade.  

Sadly, Frampton’s original Comes Alive Les Paul Custom was lost in 1980 when a cargo plane crashed in Venezuela. But Gibson’s Custom Shop raised it from the ashes in the form of the Peter Frampton Les Paul, a guitar crafted in the image of the 1954/1960 Les Paul Custom, but with a few new twists to the artists specifications. Wearing a high-gloss ebony black “black beauty” finish, gold-plated hardware, multi-ply body and headstock binding, and the decorative mother-of-pearl “split-diamond” headstock inlay and block position markers in its Richlite fingerboard, the Peter Frampton Les Paul is the spitting image of the original. At Frampton’s request, however, it benefits from a slim-carved neck profile for optimum speed, and a weight-relieved mahogany body and carved solid maple top that both lighten the load and enhance the tone. A classic Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece pairing keep things tight, resonant and sustaining, while three open-coil humbucking pickups of Frampton’s own specification—a 57 Classic in the neck position, a 57 Classic Plus in the middle, and a 500T in the bridge—provide all the tones, from sultry to sizzling, that this virtuoso guitarist is known for. As a high-caliber instrument, the Peter Frampton Les Paul naturally comes with a Custom Shop hardshell case, along with a Certificate of Authenticity and Gibson’s Limited Lifetime Warranty.  

Check one out today at your authorized Gibson dealer, and prepare to let your tone come alive.

                Frampton's Own 1954 Les Paul Custom–You Can't Keep A Great Les Paul Down
            











$20,799







                GRAMMY® winning guitarist Peter Frampton's heavily customized 1954 Les Paul Custom is one of the most recognized guitars in rock history, having been featured on his massive-selling Frampton Comes Alive! album as well as many other historic albums in which Peter was a session player. Presumed lost when a cargo plane crashed in Venezuela in 1980, the guitar was returned to Peter in 2012, restored, and measured in precise detail for this painstaking, hand-aged re-creation–the closest you can possibly come to owning one of the world's most iconic Les Pauls.

                A Heavily Aged Replica of One of Rock's Most Unbelievable Guitar Stories-The Phenix
            


                    Peter Frampton's 1954 Les Paul Custom, recreated to match its current day condition, over thirty years after surviving a plane crash.  The same guitar featured on Frampton's Double Live album and was returned to him in 2012.  This limited edition of 35 guitars heavily aged by Tom Murphy, is created based on the very same Les Paul Custom that Peter now (again) tours and records with as his number one.

Neither: it's an acoustic electric guitar. As all guitarists know, there are times when you want an acoustic guitar, and other times when you want an electric guitar. With an acoustic electric guitar, you have the best of both worlds.How an Acoustic Electric Guitar WorksFrom the player's perspective an acoustic electric guitar is not that different from any other guitar, acoustic or electric. It commonly has the same six strings, fourteen frets, body and neck as any other guitar. You pick and strum the guitar just like any other, and your fingers press the frets in the same fashion. The difference is that it has both a hollow body with a sound hole, and pickups so that it can function in either mode.Picking up the PiecesWhat separates an acoustic electric from a pure acoustic are the pickups: tiny transducers that turn string vibrations into electrical impulses. Most acoustic electrics rely on soundhole pickups, which slide in through the soundhole and connect to a standard jack at the base of the guitar. If you want to turn any acoustic into an electric acoustic you can just add contact pickups, which stick on the outside of your guitar. It's quick and easy, though you do have to be careful about positioning. The least invasive are piezoelectric pickups that mount out of the way in the undersaddle.Used as an Electric GuitarJust like any other electric guitar, you can plug your acoustic electric into an amplifier and fill the concert hall with sound. The only catch is that you have to be careful about feedback because of the location of the pickups right over the sound hole. Some guitars use different sound hole patterns so that the air doesn't flow directly over the pickups which makes controlling feedback much easier. They also have hollow bodies, so they aren't quite as rigid as a solid body electric guitar.The Big QuestionWhy use an acoustic electric guitar? The simple reason is that while it may not be the best choice for every occasion; it's a much better electric guitar than a pure acoustic, and a much better acoustic guitar than any solid body electric. If you only have one guitar for every job, it's the obvious choice.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryGuitars & BassesAcoustic Electric GuitarsAcoustic GuitarsBass GuitarsGuitar Packages for BeginnersCigar Box GuitarsClassical GuitarsGuitar AmplifiersGuitar Building & Luthier SuppliesElectric GuitarsLap & Pedal Steel GuitarsResonator GuitarsTravel GuitarsGuitar Parts & AccessoriesOther GuitarsBrandsee allFenderGibsonIbanezMartinOvationTakamineTaylorYamahaString Configurationsee all4 String6 String12 StringBody Typesee allBajo SextoChildren'sDreadnoughtHollowJumboSemi-HollowSilentSolidBody Materialsee allCedarKoaMahoganyMapleRosewoodSpruceDexteritysee allConditionsee allNewNew other (see details)Manufacturer refurbishedSeller refurbishedUsedFor parts or not workingNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

The story is about the contributionof Australian volunteers to the British army's effort to dislodge the Turks from Gallipoli, ensuringtheir control of the access from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.This story starts quite slowly, and even as it moves along you wonder when it will "turn serious".Don't be deceived by the apparent lack of a war story for at least the first half.  The director iswalking you, the viewer, through the changes in the mind-set of young 18, 19, 20 year old lads, fromthe glamour of the idea of leaving rural Australia and making their mark in history, to theirless than stellar training in Egypt, and yes, then the call to action.  Then first encounters, whichdon't seem so bad.  Then, to the full horror of what The Great War really was like.  This film, likea large freight train, starts slowly but steadily builds momentum all the way through to the closingscene, which feels about like standing on the railroad track with the locomotive bearing down onyou at full speed.  This is a classic.Read more0Comment|

Johnsonon May 24, 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseAgain we find the everyman soldier ground up in the meat-grinder of World War I.  This time the Australian soldiers are asked to step up to the plate and secure a beachhead at Gallipoli... the Normandy Beach of World War I.  Futile, incompetent military leaders.. particularly those in London calling the shots.... the dead pile up (on both sides).  Knowing that, the viewer sails off with Mel and his chum as they manipulate their enlistment.  This is a very well written script - tight - splendid photography - amazing vistas in which our two heros soldier on - not really comprehending the big picture.  The writing is very layered so that we cannot help but be engaged by these soldiers dilemma - shocking ending that had me sitting silent in the theater as the credits rolled when I first saw it.  And I've returned to it several times - first rate cinema.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsScorpios Review: Good movie of the time, needed more explosions.Bycomedianmastaon June 20, 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseGallipoli is a touching story about two unlikely strangers becoming friends and joining an idea: becoming war heroes. They both have different reasons and different reactions. In the end, this ideology is shattered as the true horrors of war come full front.Good movie, good acting, good Gibson. However, be warned: this movie is incredibly 80s. If you're looking for a Saving Private Ryan this is more of a buddy cop. They go on a series of misadventures and the war is kind of the finale. Do not, I repeat, do not think this is going to be all explosions all the time. Trailer is misleading. That aside, this is a good movie that I am surprised didn't get more Attention, showing a Side of WW1 not often discussed.As a WW1 flick, this is a good movie that'll take you away from england, muddy france, and german bad guys and tell a different, more heartfelt story.Read more0Comment|

Mel Gibson showed good promise in this film.  The real reason behind the Gallipoli failure was not brought out but the pain of living day by day on a nasty bit of brutal real estate was.  Not a great film but worth watching.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsClassic Weir film gets improved extras and transferByWayne KleinHALL OF FAMETOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon December 19, 2005Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseAn infamous conflict in history that occurred during WW I, "Gallipoli" comes around for the infamous double dip from Paramount. This time around, though, Paramount gets it right and includes a six part documentary on the real conflict and the making of the movie. This was the first vehicle where I caught my first performance of Mel Gibson who along with Mark Lee create the heart and soul of Weir's terrific film about the brutality of war. The film has aged remarkable well despite the use of early synthesizer music as an occasional score (much like "Chariots of Fire" whose synthesizer score pleasant as it is has aged badly).Archy Hamilton (Lee) runs like the wind. He's got the speed and ability to be an Olympic caliber athlete but his idealistic beliefs pull him away from running to serve in the war in the Australian cavalry. He's joined by rival Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson) another amazing sprinter who competes for the money. The two strike up an unlikely friendship after their match against each other and end up enlisting despite Dunne's initial disinterest in becoming yet another body trying to outrun flying bullets. This harsh indictment of the b senseless nature of war and how it robs the world of promising young men in their prime allows Weir to wax on the nature of what war costs a nation. Weir avoids the politics of right or wrong regarding the conflict instead focusing on the terrible cost war visits on human life. The visuals are frequent stunning and "Gallipoli" like Weir's earlier films continued to show the breathtaking development of an amazing filmmaker with as much intelligence behind the camera as skill with it.Paramount's previous release looked extremely good on DVD. This edition looks remarkable sharp and crisp with a nice reproduction of the textures, colors and clarity of the theatrical release. The 5.1 audio sounds fine here although clearly it isn't used to the optimal effect it could be given the film's age.We get a six part documentary on the making of the film that also includes a bit of history. Featuring interviews with the late Bill Gammage author of "The Broken Years", film director Weir, screenwriter Williamson actors Gibson, Lee and others from the production of the film the documentary focuses initially on the conditions that provoked the country to become involved in WWI despite no direct threat to their nation. It's far from the dry documentaries that many people are accustomed to, the inclusion of those who were involved in the production of the film discussing the circumstances of the conflict at Gallipoli makes the documentary far more entertaining and interesting that one might expect otherwise. Inspired by Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" Weir decided to do the film after visiting Gallipoli in Turkey. There's footage that shows the historically preserved location. Weir discusses the emotional impact of his visit and how it solidified his decision to make the movie. Weir relates how there are still items from the war at the site. Weir brought Williamson on as the writer and the film's genesis actually began in 1977 with their collaboration. They went through many drafts before discovering the core story. Gammage's book which included letters from actual soldiers from the time became the touchstone for Weir and Williamson. We also get the original theatrical trailer for the film. There's no commentary track as Weir isn't a fan of commentary tracks. A terrific film, this is a bitter reminder of the callousness of war. For those that feel the need to enlist this is an enlightening reminder that the job of the military isn't a game nor is it a frat. Once called into service war is a brutal, nasty business that plucks whole generations and wipes them from the face of the Earth sometimes for a questionable cause. Without going into the politics of the war, Weir brilliant visualizes the destruction of war and the script written by David Williamson provides perfectly realized characters in this powerful film.Read more0Comment|

Peter Weir, the director, guided this project influencing every aspect of this superb production's script and acting, and created a compelling movie that just 'stays with you'. The extra features are outstanding and essential viewing. This is a window into a wider view Australian culture and history beyond the immediacy of the horrendous battle.Read more0Comment|

Where guitars take the lead, basses build the musical foundation that anchors the piece. Together they give popular music its signature sound.Start Way Down LowAt first glance the bass guitar, or just plain bass as it's commonly known, looks like any other guitar. It follows the same basic design, with a long neck growing out of a standard guitar body. The big difference is in the strings. Where a guitar normally starts with six strings and goes up, most bass guitars only have four strings. A few have six, but for the most part you can tell a bass by the string count.Move Up to AcousticThe acoustic guitar is the signature instrument of the singer songwriter. Instead of using an amplifier, it has a hollow body with a resonant chamber to produce sound. As soon as you pull it out of its hardshell case it's ready to go, with no need to plug in. Just slip the strap over your neck and start strumming and plucking. A beginners model from Fender or Yamaha is all you need to get started on your musical career.Plug It In If You WantThe best thing about an acoustic electric guitar is that you can use it anywhere for anything. When you're at home or in a small setting you can pull your Gibson or Taylor out of the guitar case and start playing with no need for setup. To go on stage, just plug in and you're ready to bring the house down with a sound that reaches the far side of the arena. It's the ultimate utility knife of the guitar world, equally at home around a campfire or plugged into an amplifier.Take a Swing At an Electric AxeTake in a rock concert and chances are you'll see nothing but electric guitars from Stratocasters to Telecasters and beyond. With a solid body and dual coil pickups it's perfectly designed for blasting rock out over the audience. The thing to remember about electric guitars is that your sound is only as good as your amplifier. Without a chamber, the strings aren't loud enough to hear, so the amplifier boosts the signal enough to drive a speaker.

When I bought it, I was very pleased. The overall tone is beautifull. It has a fat, mellow tone for blues and a surprising bit of crunch for rock. The only downside is the price. If you can dish out the money, I highly recomend this great guitar.(78 of 96 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review1/12/2011(6 of 9 customers found this review helpful) 3.0great guitar By mike lfrom albany nyComments about Gibson Custom Peter Frampton Les Paul Custom:i love the customs and really like the triple pickup ones the only thing with gibson is the price. you can buy a good fender without making you bankrupt. if they cost so much i would get a million of them(6 of 9 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review4/22/2014(4 of 4 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Peter Frampton By 3939643 3939643from Los Angeles CaComments about Gibson Custom Peter Frampton Les Paul Custom:I have owned this guitar for 5 years and it is fantastic. The chambers make the weight perfect and the combination of pick up choice creates a very versatile guitar. It only takes a minute to figure out that each volume controls their assigned pickup and the switch is the coil combination. Genius really. Extremely reliable and has been used on tons of gigs. For Class Act (another reviewer) who did not like buying a named guitar (Peter Frampton) perhaps he does not understand Les Paul was a real dude so any Gibson Single Cut will be buying a named guitar. This one just has the bonus of two names, Les and Peter. I wonder if the 2014/15 model will change slightly now that the original has been recovered and any discrepancies that were made from Peter's memory can be corrected.(4 of 4 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/2/2017(0 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 4.0great feel 0 power By Nickfrom FloridaAbout Me ExperiencedProsGood FeelConsPoor Pick UpBest UsesRecordingComments about Gibson Custom Peter Frampton Les Paul Custom:Really great looking and feeling guitar. First class craftsmanship. My big problem is the 500t and '57's have no power. They growl they crunch. However, they do not wail. Good luck getting any kind of pinch harmonic or even a meager squeak out of this thing. This beast lives in the mid-range exclusively. My other big issue with this guitar is the Richlite fingerboard. It feels great and looks fantastic. Indeed, I have no doubt it is every bit as sonically and structurally valid as ebony.....however, for this price there is no reason I can think of that justifies not putting a 30 dollar slab of ebony on there. C'mon Gibson I can get ebony put on a 300 dollar Chinese guitar!

This guitar will show you the way!
Solidbody Electric Guitar with Mahogany Body, Maple Top, Mahogany Neck, Richlite Fingerboard, and 3 Humbucking Pickups - Black


Peter Frampton was already an accomplished musician when his classic Frampton Comes Alive came out. The year was 1976, and even some 38 years later that double album remains the best-selling live album of all time. The guitar primarily used on that legendary album is a black Gibson Les Paul Custom. While the original was tragically lost in a cargo plane crash in 1980, the Gibson Custom Shop Peter Frampton Les Paul solidbody electric guitar is a spitting image of the classic guitar. At Sweetwater, we know guitars, and this one is an elegant classic!
Gibson Custom Shop Peter Frampton Les Paul Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance: 
The Story
The Guitar
The Story
As the story goes, Frampton was onstage as a member of Humble Pie when a fan in the audience noticed he was having trouble with his semi-hollowbody guitar feeding back. After the show a fan approached and offered Frampton the use of the now-famous black 3-pickup Les Paul. Peter fell in love with the guitar immediately, thanks to its impressive tone and immense playability. When Frampton offered to buy the guitar, it was given to him by the fan. And that's how the refinished and retrofitted 1954 Les Paul Custom became an icon that still resonates today.
The Guitar
Originally believed to be a 1960 Les Paul Custom, the Gibson Custom Shop Peter Frampton Les Paul is actually based on what was a 1954 Les Paul Custom that had just been refinished and fitted with a trio of humbuckers. Just like the original, this one is sporting the classic combination of a mahogany body and maple top that gives you the strong midrange and sweet sustain that we've all grow to love. The neck - topped with a Richlite fingerboard - is slim-carved, making it optimal for quick runs up and down the neck. For the pickups, a trio of open-coil humbucking pickups - a 57 Classic in the neck position, a 57 Classic Plus in the middle, and a 500T in the bridge - provide a multitude of tones for your playing enjoyment. Gold hardware rounds out this elegant rocker.
Gibson Custom Shop Peter Frampton Les Paul Solidbody Electric Guitar Features: 
A re-creation of a classic axe
Black finish and gold hardware give an air of elegance
Wide range of tones available from a trio of humbucking pickups
Slim-carve neck for excellent playability
Mahogany body and maple top provide classic Les Paul tone
Richlite fingerboard is both beautiful and comfortable
A re-creation of the guitar that made Frampton come alive can by yours with the Gibson Custom Shop Peter Frampton Les Paul Solidbody Electric Guitar!

Found


		The original guitar was found and returned to Peter in 2012. The theory is that one of the people guarding the crash site snagged 5-6 guitars, Frampton's custom 54 LP being one of them. After negotiations, he got it back and has been playing it ever since.
