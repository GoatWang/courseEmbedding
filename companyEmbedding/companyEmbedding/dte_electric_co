History[edit]
Detroit Edison was part of a large holding company called North American Edison Company. North American's stock had once been one of the twelve component stocks of the May 1896 original Dow Jones Industrial Average.[1] North American Company was broken up by the Securities and Exchange Commission, following the United States Supreme Court decision of April 1, 1946.[2]
After that Detroit Edison operated independently, and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol DTE through the mid-1990s. In early 1996, it became an operating subsidiary of the new holding company, DTE Energy Company, which replaced Detroit Edison Company on the stock exchange, and took over the trading ticker symbol.[3]
Power generation[edit]
Main article: DTE Energy § Existing coal-fired power plants




The St. Clair Power Plant.






The Monroe Power Plant.


The utility operates eleven fossil-fuel generating plants, as well as the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station. The company is co-owner, with Consumers Energy, of the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, a hydroelectric pumped storage facility in Ludington, Michigan. DTE uses fossil fuels (mainly coal) to generate 80-85 percent of its total electrical output, with the bulk of the remainder coming from nuclear power.[4]
At 3,300 MW, DTE's Monroe Power Plant has the third largest generating capacity of any coal-fired power plant in North America. Only Georgia Power's Plant Bowen located near Atlanta, Georgia and Ontario Power Generation's Nanticoke Generating Station in Canada have more generating capacity.
DTE operates the coal-fired St. Clair Power Plant in St. Clair, Michigan, and the Belle River Power Plant in East China, Michigan on the west bank of the St. Clair River. Also in St. Clair County lies the Greenwood Energy Center, a natural gas-burning and fuel oil-burning plant. [5]
On the Detroit River, DTE operates the River Rouge Power Plant in River Rouge and the Trenton Channel Power Plant in Trenton, which all burn coal.
Energy transmission[edit]
Main article: ITC Transmission
As a condition of electric utility deregulation in Michigan, DTE Energy was forced to sell off Detroit Edison's sister subsidiary involved in high-voltage energy transmission: International Transmission Co. (ITC).
Energy distribution[edit]
Detroit Edison's near 11-gigawatt generating capacity is offered to its 7,600-square-mile (20,000 km2) service area, which encompasses 13 counties in the southeastern portion of Michigan's lower peninsula. Energy is distributed throughout Huron, Tuscola, Sanilac, Saint Clair, Lapeer, Livingston, Ingham, Oakland, Macomb, Wayne, Washtenaw, Lenawee and Monroe counties by over a million utility poles and 44,000 miles (71,000 km) of power lines.
Detroit Edison's distribution line voltages are three-phase 4,800 volts (Delta) 4,800/8,320 volts (wye) and 7,620/13,200 volts (Wye) . All new distribution circuits constructed after 1959 are 13,200 volts. The 8,320 volt distribution lines are located in Pontiac, Michigan in an area that was served by Consumers Power Company until the mid-1980s when the area was acquired by Detroit Edison. Edison's subtransmission line voltages are 24,000 volts and 41,600 volts.
DTE Rail Service Inc.[edit]
With the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Transportation railroad in 1970, Detroit Edison sought to continue transporting coal from the Monongahela mines in Pennsylvania to a brand new power plant in Monroe, Michigan. However, the bankruptcy of Penn Central left Detroit Edison short of motive power and under capacitated coal hoppers. Detroit Edison then chose to purchase brand new locomotives and coal cars to fit their needs. Purchasing EMD SD40's and GE U30C's for mainline motive power as well as High-Side Articulated Gondolas (with a capacity of 185,000 pounds), this new equipment allowed Detroit Edison to move more coal en masse than what Penn Central was able to do with their equipment. The trains were maintained by Detroit Edison officials but operated by Penn Central crews.
By the late 1980s or early 1990, Detroit Edison discontinued use of their equipment, as Conrail began to supply enough locomotives and rolling stock to meet the power company's needs.

History[edit]
Detroit Edison was part of a large holding company called North American Edison Company. North American's stock had once been one of the twelve component stocks of the May 1896 original Dow Jones Industrial Average.[1] North American Company was broken up by the Securities and Exchange Commission, following the United States Supreme Court decision of April 1, 1946.[2]
After that Detroit Edison operated independently, and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol DTE through the mid-1990s. In early 1996, it became an operating subsidiary of the new holding company, DTE Energy Company, which replaced Detroit Edison Company on the stock exchange, and took over the trading ticker symbol.[3]
Power generation[edit]
Main article: DTE Energy § Existing coal-fired power plants




The St. Clair Power Plant.






The Monroe Power Plant.


The utility operates eleven fossil-fuel generating plants, as well as the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station. The company is co-owner, with Consumers Energy, of the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, a hydroelectric pumped storage facility in Ludington, Michigan. DTE uses fossil fuels (mainly coal) to generate 80-85 percent of its total electrical output, with the bulk of the remainder coming from nuclear power.[4]
At 3,300 MW, DTE's Monroe Power Plant has the third largest generating capacity of any coal-fired power plant in North America. Only Georgia Power's Plant Bowen located near Atlanta, Georgia and Ontario Power Generation's Nanticoke Generating Station in Canada have more generating capacity.
DTE operates the coal-fired St. Clair Power Plant in St. Clair, Michigan, and the Belle River Power Plant in East China, Michigan on the west bank of the St. Clair River. Also in St. Clair County lies the Greenwood Energy Center, a natural gas-burning and fuel oil-burning plant. [5]
On the Detroit River, DTE operates the River Rouge Power Plant in River Rouge and the Trenton Channel Power Plant in Trenton, which all burn coal.
Energy transmission[edit]
Main article: ITC Transmission
As a condition of electric utility deregulation in Michigan, DTE Energy was forced to sell off Detroit Edison's sister subsidiary involved in high-voltage energy transmission: International Transmission Co. (ITC).
Energy distribution[edit]
Detroit Edison's near 11-gigawatt generating capacity is offered to its 7,600-square-mile (20,000 km2) service area, which encompasses 13 counties in the southeastern portion of Michigan's lower peninsula. Energy is distributed throughout Huron, Tuscola, Sanilac, Saint Clair, Lapeer, Livingston, Ingham, Oakland, Macomb, Wayne, Washtenaw, Lenawee and Monroe counties by over a million utility poles and 44,000 miles (71,000 km) of power lines.
Detroit Edison's distribution line voltages are three-phase 4,800 volts (Delta) 4,800/8,320 volts (wye) and 7,620/13,200 volts (Wye) . All new distribution circuits constructed after 1959 are 13,200 volts. The 8,320 volt distribution lines are located in Pontiac, Michigan in an area that was served by Consumers Power Company until the mid-1980s when the area was acquired by Detroit Edison. Edison's subtransmission line voltages are 24,000 volts and 41,600 volts.
DTE Rail Service Inc.[edit]
With the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Transportation railroad in 1970, Detroit Edison sought to continue transporting coal from the Monongahela mines in Pennsylvania to a brand new power plant in Monroe, Michigan. However, the bankruptcy of Penn Central left Detroit Edison short of motive power and under capacitated coal hoppers. Detroit Edison then chose to purchase brand new locomotives and coal cars to fit their needs. Purchasing EMD SD40's and GE U30C's for mainline motive power as well as High-Side Articulated Gondolas (with a capacity of 185,000 pounds), this new equipment allowed Detroit Edison to move more coal en masse than what Penn Central was able to do with their equipment. The trains were maintained by Detroit Edison officials but operated by Penn Central crews.
By the late 1980s or early 1990, Detroit Edison discontinued use of their equipment, as Conrail began to supply enough locomotives and rolling stock to meet the power company's needs.

North American Natural Gas Pipelines & Shale/Resource Plays 2014 Edition






	Regulators in Michigan agreed with an administrative law judge's finding that plans by DTE Electric Co. to contract with Nexus Gas Transmission LLC to buy natural gas for power generation appear "reasonable and prudent," despite the pipeline being partly owned by a utility affiliate.

	But the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) also conceded that plans by DTE Energy Co. to jointly develop the 255-mile pipeline with Spectra Energy Corp. represented "perhaps the greatest area of controversy" in the proceedings, and denied the utility permission to recover power supply costs for the $2 billion project from its customers.

	The Nexus pipeline would move 1.5 Bcf/d of Marcellus and Utica shale gas from eastern Ohio into Michigan, connecting Appalachian gas to markets in the Midwest and Canada. It received a favorable draft environmental impact statement (EIS) from FERC last July.

	In an order last Thursday [Case No. U-17920], the PSC approved DTE Electric's power supply cost recovery plan for the 2016 calendar year at a factor of 20 cents/kWh. The commission also accepted the utility's five-year forecast, covering 2016 through 2020, of projected power supply requirements and the cost of that supply.

	The PSC said it supports the proposal for decision issued by Administrative Law Judge Dennis Mack last October, and would adopt his findings. But the commission added that "the issues raised by the intervenors merit the close and thorough discussion undertaken in this proceeding." The intervenors include ANR Pipeline Co., environmental groups and the state's attorney general.

	DTE Energy's participation in the proposed pipeline "appeared to be at the very root of the many objections presented [by the intervenors]," the PSC said. "Resolute allegations of violation of the [state] Code of Conduct, lack of arm's length negotiations, failure to consider viable alternative pipeline companies, failure to obtain economic pricing, and failure to have an appropriately transparent contractual process, were vehemently denied by DTE Electric."

	The commission added that it "finds that costs associated with Nexus should not be recoverable absent a transparent evidentiary presentation examining the full nature of the Nexus arrangements. Only under such circumstances will the commission be prepared to determining the viability of said costs."

	According to PSC records, in its initial application in September 2015, DTE Electric requested approval of a uniform monthly maximum power supply cost recovery factor of 0.20 mills/kWh for its customers. Mack noted that DTE Electric estimated that it would need more than 47.3 million kWh to meet its customers' needs in 2016, and total system power supply costs would be $1.4 billion, including total base transmission costs of $316 million.

	In 2014, ANR, a subsidiary of TransCanada Corp., proposed building the ANR East Project, a scalable, multi-part project that would transport shale gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales to the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Ontario through multiple pipeline interconnections.

	The Nexus Pipeline is also in competition with the 700-mile Rover Pipeline, which would follow a similar route and bring 3.25 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Appalachian Basin to Michigan. Rover, backed by Energy Transfer Partners LP, received a final EIS from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last July and awaits a final authorization decision.

	Last year, DTE Energy announced plans to retire eight coal-fired generation units in Michigan over the next seven years, replacing them with a mix of generation including natural gas and renewables. It also announced plans to invest up to $1.5 billion to replace coal-fired plants by 2023. The company also agreed to purchase two natural gas gathering systems in Pennsylvania and West Virginia for a combined $1.3 billion, adding to its midstream portfolio and expanding its presence into the southwest Marcellus and Utica shales.

	DTE Energy serves 2.2 million electric customers and 1.2 million natural gas customers in Michigan.

Payments










What is DTE Energy's bill payment policy?








We bill on a monthly basis. Bills are due 17 days after mailing. If you are mailing your payment, please allow 5-7 days for postal delivery to assure your payment arrives before the due date. Balances not paid in full by the due date will be charged a 2 percent late fee, and the account may become eligible for shutoff action at any and/or all meters attached to that account.
Any additional DTE Energy program a customer is enrolled in — such as Home Protection Plus® — is subject to the terms of that existing contract, and may be discontinued if the bill is not paid in full (or per the existing payment arrangement) each month. 
If you are having difficulty meeting your financial obligations, we offer many forms of Energy Assistance, including payment agreements, General Assistance, Low Income Programs, Shutoff Protection Plan and Low Income Self-Sufficiency Plan.














What payment methods are accepted? 








DTE Energy accepts the following methods of payment online: checking account, savings account, debit card, Visa®, MasterCard® or Discover®. Cash payments are also accepted at our DTE Energy Bill Payment Kiosks.














What does "Payment Name" mean when I add an account?








The payment method description allows you to label your different payment methods for easy identification. The only requirements are the description must contain 45 characters or less and must be unique for each payment method.














My credit card has expired. Can I change it online?








An expired credit card can be deleted only (even if the new card has the same numbers as the old card). A card which has not yet expired may be updated with a new expiration date, CVV code or ZIP code.

Sign in to your account and go to the Manage Payment Methods page. From here you can edit your existing bank accounts and charge cards in addition to adding and deleting payment methods.














How do I change the name I assigned to my payment method?








Once saved, payment method names cannot be modified. If you’d like to change the name assigned to your saved Payment Method, first delete the payment method, then re-add it.

To add, delete or edit your saved Payment Methods, sign in to your account and go to the My Payment Methods page. You will see the option to Edit or Delete a Payment Method and an option to Add Payment Method.














How many payment methods can I keep on my account?








Each user may store up to five payment methods.














What are the maximum and minimum payments accepted online? 








The credit card maximum payment limit is $99,999.99 and the ACH/bank maximum payment limit is $499,999.99. The minimum payment accepted for both is $1.00.














Why can't I pay using a bank account?








We do not accept payments from a bank account if there have been issues with multiple returned payments within the last twelve months. You may use a credit or debit card to pay online.














Can I make a same day online payment?








Payments can be scheduled to post to your DTE Energy account as early as the same business day or up to 60 days in advance. Payments made after 1:00 p.m. will automatically be applied on the next business day.














How do I know my online payment has posted?








Go to the My Billing & History page on your online account to view your payment history. Depending on the status of your payment, you will see one of following statuses.
Pending
This status will appear if you have initiated a payment for today or scheduled payments for up to 60 days in the future. Payments made for today's date cannot be cancelled or modified. Future scheduled payments can be modified or cancelled.
Received
This indicates that your payment has been processed by our billing system. If the payment was successfully processed, the amount of the payment will be reflected in your amount due. Note: A payment indicated as “processed” may not have successfully been posted to your account. We may have had difficulty taking your online payment if any of your payment information is incorrect and/or has not been updated (for example, if you have been issued a new credit card and your expiration date has changed). Always check with your financial institution to ensure that electronic payments have been successfully posted.
Cancelled
If you cancel a payment for any reason, it should be viewable here for 60 days.














How do I modify or cancel a scheduled payment?








Payments can be scheduled or canceled up to one business day before the scheduled payment date. Same day payments cannot be cancelled or modified online.
To modify a scheduled payment, sign in and go to your Billing and Payment History page. Payments that are eligible to be modified will have “Cancel” and “Edit” options. 
After the change has been successfully processed, you will receive a new confirmation number and the Billing and Payment History page will be updated. 














Why did my payment fail?








If we are unable to process your payment, most likely it was declined by your financial institution. Common reasons for declined payments include:

Your credit or debit card information has expired or is incorrect.
Your bank account information is incorrect.
Insufficient funds. Please choose another form of payment.
Your financial institution has placed a hold on your account. Please contact your bank or credit card company directly.















How do I pay multiple accounts?








If you receive multiple statements, you may pay up to five accounts in a single transaction at one time. When you have signed in, go to the My Current Bill page and use the checkboxes on the right-hand side to select up to five of your accounts. To pay more than five, you will need to initiate a second transaction.

Please note:  Each grouping of payments must be made using the same payment method and date. To initiate multiple payments using different funding sources or dates, you will need to pay each bill separately.

Electricity enables us to live more comfortably, securely and efficiently than ever before through smart phones, electric vehicles, smart homes and smart grid technology.








DTE Energy Electricity Benefits







Affordable
Electricity is incredibly affordable. Operating a 19-watt compact fluorescent light bulb (equivalent to a 75 watt incandescent light bulb) costs $2.37 per year. That’s less than the cost of one coffee from your local barista.
Convenient
Electricity is there when you need it. We build and maintain the generation facilities and distribution system to get electricity to you at the speed of light, the blink of a computer screen, the whir of a hair dryer, the… well, you know… everything to power your life.
Flexible
Optimize your electric consumption by installing timers and setback thermostats that control lighting, heating and cooling automatically and in sync with your schedule. During the summer, for every degree above 72 you set your thermostat, you could reduce your cooling bill by 3 percent. You can also save more with DTE Rate Programs that offer special discounts for off-peak electric use.  


Environmentally Friendly
DTE Energy owns or contracts nearly 1,000 megawatts of renewable electric generating capacity—mainly from wind energy—which will account for 10 percent of our customer’s electricity needs. That's enough to power 400,000 homes, the equivalent of a city three times the size of Ann Arbor. 

You can reduce your environmental footprint by choosing energy-efficient electric products. Electric mowers, clippers, edgers and snow blowers offer a clean, quiet alternative to engines that run on a mixture of oil and gasoline. 

Economical
In addition to being good for the world we live in, replacing an energy-inefficient appliance with new energy-wise product can also save you money each month. Additionally, DTE Energy can recycle your outdated appliances for you. Not only will we pick up your old refrigerator or freezer and reprocess 95 percent of the components, we will also mail you a check for $50 each. We’ll also pay $20 for an old working room air conditioner or dehumidifier picked up at the same time. 

Visit our Save Energy section to learn more about the ways you can conserve resources while saving money.









Know Your Own Power, Electricity




Our DTE Electric subsidiary generates and distributes electricity to 2.2 million customers in southeastern Michigan. With an 11,084 megawatt system capacity, the company uses coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, hydroelectric pumped storage and renewable sources to generate its electrical output.

But did you also know?



DTE Energy is among the nation's top three North American coal marketers and transporters. We move more than 18 million tons of coal throughout the Great Lakes market annually. That’s in addition to the 21 million tons used by DTE Electric.
At 1.1 million kilowatts, the company’s Fermi 2 nuclear power plant represents 30 percent of Michigan’s total nuclear generation capacity. This single plant is capable of producing enough electricity to serve a city of about one million people. Fermi 2 has been providing reliable, cost-effective power to DTE Electric customers for more than 20 years. The plant also has been designated one of the nation’s best-performing nuclear facilities.
Across the country, DTE Energy Services owns and/or operates on-site energy projects with automakers, steel companies, large commercial and industrial businesses, and the pulp and paper industry.
DTE Biomass Energy converts methane emitted from decomposing trash into electricity, steam and pipeline-quality gas at more than 20 landfill recovery sites in 14 states.
DTE Energy operates businesses in 19 states, employing nearly 10,000 men and women.
