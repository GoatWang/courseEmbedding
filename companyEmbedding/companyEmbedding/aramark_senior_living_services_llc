Where is Esencia? Describe the sort of views associated with this village.
Dramatically rising from the floor of the San Juan Valley in South Orange County and situated along some of the highest elevations in the heart of The Ranch is Esencia (Spanish translation: the essence). Esencia encompasses 890 acres of westerly-facing hills which afford both coastal views and backcountry panoramas. More specifically, Esencia is located east of the intersection of Ortega Highway and Antonio Parkway/La Pata Road, and along the first segments of Cow Camp Road — on Rancho Mission Viejo, in unincorporated South Orange County.

At build-out, the village of Esencia is planned to provide an integrated mix of 2,537 homes offered for sale to people of all ages and life stages including “Gavilán®” neighborhoods of primarily single-story homes for people age 55-plus. The first collection of homes offered for sale at Esencia were part of The Canyon House Neighborhoods, which introduced a new model for inter-generational living by integrating Gavilán® 55-plus neighborhoods into Esencia’s all age neighborhoods. Homes in The Canyon House Neighborhoods are currently priced from the high $400,000s to over $1 million.
 The next collection of homes at Esencia, known as The Hilltop Neighborhoods, will continue this level of integration around an inter-generational recreational and social amenity called The Hilltop Club. The Hilltop Neighborhoods are slated to debut in Fall 2016.
What are the prices of homes to be offered within the first new-home collection at Esencia?
Homes in The Canyon House Neighborhoods at Esencia are currently priced from the high $400,000s to over $1 million. Home prices have not been released for The Hilltop Neighborhoods.

Homes are sold through the individual Esencia neighborhood homebuilders, who create and implement their own sales and purchase procedures and protocols. The best way to learn more about neighborhood homebuilder procedures and protocols as well as participate in invitation-only homeshopper events is to visit www.RanchoMissionViejo.com, click on “Sign Up,” and complete the simple online form.

Combined, the six homebuilders will offer 522 homes for sale within six different and brand new Hilltop Neighborhoods terraced along hillsides to afford panoramic ocean and territorial views of the vast Rancho Mission Viejo.

  Since 1882, members of the O’Neill/Avery/Moiso family have owned and managed The Ranch which once exceeded 200,000 acres and now includes the family-developed cities and communities of Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, Las Flores, and Ladera Ranch as well as such important places as Caspers Wilderness Regional Park, the Starr Ranch Audubon Sanctuary, O’Neill Regional Park and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

CFDs/Mello-Roos/Other Fees

Will residents of Esencia be assessed CFD or Mello-Roos fees? If so, how much is the assessment?
As background, Community Facilities Districts (CFDs) are established by cities, counties and local government agencies as a means of obtaining tax-exempt funding (through the sale of bonds) for the construction/improvement of public facilities and key infrastructure including streets, water systems, sewage and drainage facilities, schools, public parks, as well as police and fire facilities which serve newly developing areas.
  Today, government agencies serving the vast majority of new master-planned communities in California have found that CFD funding is beneficial to homeowners because it facilitates the early construction of essential public facilities and improvements as well as reduces home prices and down payments by financing essential public facilities and improvements at tax-exempt interest rates, over a long period of time (INSTEAD OF ADDING THE COST OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PRICE OF EACH NEW HOME).
WHY/WHEN
  Prior to the passage of California Proposition 13 in 1978, Federal funding for key infrastructure was substantial AND local property taxes were commonly 2.3% and increasing as home prices skyrocketed. However, starting in 1978, Prop. 13 restricted property taxes to just 1.0% of assessed home values; and allowed only 2.0% increases in assessed value per year – just as significant population increases were occurring and Federal funding to California for new infrastructure funding was declining. As a result, cash-strapped cities, counties and government agencies were forced to find new ways to fund new schools and other public facilities and improvements to meet the needs of the state’s growing population. Led by California Senator Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville) and California Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), the Community Facilities Act (commonly called Mello-Roos) was enacted by the California State Legislature in 1982. This legislation allowed the formation of CFDs.
HOW
  At Esencia on The Ranch, determination of each home’s CFD tax (aka Mello-Roos tax) is based on the type of the home and its square footage. The CFD tax formula sets the amount of the CFD tax for each home even before it’s purchased; and the tax is then included in each new home’s property tax bills or added to impound accounts. The overall total annual property tax rate paid by a new homeowner within a CFD includes the 1.0% of assessed value per Prop. 13 PLUS any existing government-issued bonds PLUS the CFD tax and all other property tax assessments. COMBINED, that total annual property tax rate is targeted to not exceed 2% of the assessed value of the property and can be adjusted upward each year by 2%.
WHO/WHERE
  At Esencia on The Ranch, a CFD was formed to fund a wide range of public projects including the following: the construction, purchase, modification, expansion and/or improvement of certain roadways and roadway improvements (including, without limitation, the Foothill Transportation Corridor improvements and the South County Roadway Improvement Program – SCRIP), tunnels, regional hiking and biking trails, storm drains, water and wastewater facilities (including, without limitation, domestic and non-domestic water facilities, wells, reservoirs, pipelines, storm and sewer drains and related infrastructure and improvements), wet and dry utilities, bridges and pedestrian bridges, parks, traffic signals, school facilities and equipment, sheriff’s substations and equipment and library facilities and equipment, and related infrastructure improvements, both onsite and offsite, and all appurtenances and appurtenant work in connection with the foregoing (including utility line relocations and electric, gas and cable utilities).
  The overall total annual property tax rate paid by new Esencia homeowners within this CFD will be approximately 1.8% of the base home prices for owners of homes in the 55+ Gavilán® neighborhoods and approximately 2% of the base home price for all other Esencia homeowners. (Base home prices do not include any home upgrades and/or view premiums.) This total annual property tax rate will include the 1.0% base per Prop. 13 PLUS any existing government-issued bonds PLUS CFD taxes and all other property tax assessments. So, CFD taxes will be a portion of the overall annual property tax rate which is expected not to exceed 1.8% for 55+ neighborhoods or 2% for all other neighborhoods at Esencia.
COMPARE/CONTRAST
  That means that Esencia residents could pay as little as approximately $3,710 annually and as much as approximately $10,235 annually in CFD taxes – with the bulk of residents paying between approximately $4,000 and $6,750 annually. As a point of comparison, homebuyers in one of the newest areas of Irvine are paying an average of $8,590 annually in CFD taxes while those residing in the newest neighborhoods along the San Clemente coast are paying an average of $9,922 in CFD taxes.
  Esencia neighborhood homebuilders are required to disclose to homebuyers their maximum CFD taxes prior to purchase. Neighborhood homebuilders also can provide information about how to prepay the Esencia CFD taxes. Please consult your financial advisor or CPA for all tax advice.
Are there additional fees assessed for maintenance of the village and more?
A fee is collected on initial home sales by neighborhood homebuilders and on the resale of all Ranch homes to fund an important Community Services Organization called RanchLife. RanchLife is unique to Rancho Mission Viejo and each of its villages in that it funds a full calendar of Ranch-resident recreational and educational programs (i.e., fitness classes, happy hours and personal enrichment classes), community-wide events (i.e., holiday festivities, celebrations, and concerts), Ranch resident-led clubs (i.e., biking, photography, hiking, bocce, gardening, mommy and me, wine and dine, and more), a community-wide web portal, and program collaboration with various Ranch partners.
  In addition, all Rancho Mission Viejo homeowners pay a monthly master homeowners associations fee through the Ranch Master Maintenance Corporation or Rancho MCC. Rancho MMC funds the management and maintenance of Rancho Mission Viejo’s many community recreational amenities and facilities including each of the clubhouses at Sendero and those under construction and planned for Esencia as well as all the community farms, parks, common area landscaping, hardscape, lighting, trails, and monumentation as well as related staffing and administration. The monthly general Rancho MCC assessment for Esencia homeowners equals $164/mo.
  Additional fees will be assessed for other purposes including attached-home sub-associations and/or “special benefit areas” (i.e., covering the maintenance of slopes, alley areas, gated neighborhoods, and more).


Schools

What school will Esencia students attend; and within what school district?
Esencia students attending public schools will attend schools within the Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD). Founded in 1965, CUSD encompasses 195 square miles in seven cities and portions of unincorporated Orange County (including Sendero, Esencia and additonal villages planned for The Ranch). Over the last few decades, CUSD has grown in both size and acclaim, earning more than 50 California Distinguished School recognitions and approximately a dozen National Blue Ribbon recognitions.
Esencia K-8
  CUSD, in partnership with Rancho Mission Viejo, LLC (community planner and master developer), has already selected a site at Esencia for the new Esencia K-8 school campus. Planned to be built adjacent to the school is a community park with a joint-use multi-purpose building, open play area, a children’s playground, and a barbeque garden.
 Esencia K-8 school is currently estimated to open for instruction in Fall 2018.
  In the meantime, CUSD has indicated that Esencia students will attend Las Flores Elementary School, Las Flores Middle School, and Tesoro High School. For current information on attendance boundaries, please contact CUSD directly at 949-234-9200.

Trails and The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo

Describe the trails planned for Esencia. Will they lead into open spaces and connect with Regional trails?
The walking, biking and NEV (Neighborhood Electric Vehicle) trails of Esencia are part of a larger Ranch-wide trail system which provides passage throughout Esencia, links with the village of Sendero and its amenities, as well as connects with hiking/biking trails accessing select Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo trails and a County Regional hiking and biking trails network (leading from O’Neill Regional Park into San Juan Capistrano and down to Doheny State Beach). Additional regional trails are planned. In addition, the trails of Esencia connect homes to special signature places within the village including The Canyon House and its adjacent Oak Canyon, Esencia Farm, and the future Hilltop Club (now under construction) as well as the additional amenities planned for Esencia.
How do Esencia and other Rancho Mission Viejo residents access The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo and its habitat reserve lands?
Approximately 75% of the 23,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo will be preserved as part of the protected open spaces of The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo. Only 25% of The Ranch will be developed into the villages of Rancho Mission Viejo (starting with Sendero and now continuing with Esencia). Combined with additional open spaces already dedicated by Rancho Mission Viejo, The Reserve will grow incrementally; and over time, it’s planned to be combined with County-owned lands to form the 33,000-acre Southern Subregion Habitat Reserve, one of California’s largest and most diverse habitat reserves.
  While the primary goal of The Reserve is to focus on habitat study and conservation, all sorts of programs and activities (including docent-led trail walks) are conducted year-round – with many offered exclusively to Ranch residents, including everyone living at Esencia. As Ranch residents, Esencia residents will be offered to join-in on such fun events as Knee High Naturalists activities, Rambles on the Ranch, camping, stargazing, and so much more.

Roads and Transportation

What new roads will be built to meet the transportation demands associated with Esencia and future residents on The Ranch?
The South County Road Improvement Program or SCRIP phases the funding and construction of numerous transportation improvements with new development on Rancho Mission Viejo (and possibly other development areas in South Orange County, as needed).
  Under SCRIP, several new improvements have already been made to help address roadway and traffic conditions in the Sendero area, including the following:




Widening of sections of Ortega Highway, Antonio Parkway, and La Pata Road
Installation of drainage facilities, water quality improvements and additional underground utilities
Construction of a new 300-ft long, two-lane bridge with barrier railing over San Juan Creek
Stabilization of the Creek edge to secure trail and maintenance access for County use



  SCRIP is administered by Orange County Public Works.
Cow Camp Road
  Also included in the County of Orange-approved SCRIP plan is Cow Camp Road, designated in the County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways as an east-west Major and Primary Arterial Highway. Slated to be built in two phase, Cow Camp Road will ultimately provide three lanes in each direction (for a total of six lanes) beginning at Antonio Parkway and extending four miles to the east where it will connect with Ortega Highway, near Caspers Wilderness Park. The first phase (nearly 1.5 miles) of Cow Camp Road is now open from Antonio Parkway to a location near the future intersection of Los Patrones Parkway at the eastern edge of Esencia.
  Key to the first phase of Cow Camp Road has been the design, engineering and construction of the Chiquita Canyon Bridge which spans 1,420 linear feet long and rises 75 feet above the protected open spaces of Chiquita Canyon.
  In addition to affording quick access to Esencia, Cow Camp Road will benefit local residents by providing alternative routes to existing arterials (including Ortega Highway and the I-5 Freeway) as well as quick access to the SR-241 toll road (aka the FTC or Foothill Toll Road/Transportation Corridor) at Oso Parkway via the future construction of Los Patrones Parkway.
Los Patrones Parkway (Connecting Cow Camp Road to the SR-241 Toll Road)
  Not included in SCRIP yet identified as part of the County of Orange’s 2004-approved transportation program for Rancho Mission Viejo is Los Patrones Parkway (formerly known as “F” Street), identified as a secondary arterial linking Cow Camp Road to the current Oso Parkway terminus of the SR-241 toll road (aka FTC or Foothill Toll Road/Transportation Corridor). The Transportation Corridor Agencies has announced its intention to place a toll charge on Los Patrones Parkway, between Cow Camp Road and Oso Parkway.
Extension of La Pata Road (241 Toll Road to I-5 Freeway Connection)
  The extension of La Pata Road from Ortega Highway, south to Avenida Vista Hermosa is now open. This new route will establish an important South Orange County parallel to the I-5 Freeway, allowing commuters to bypass the I-5 as they travel from as far north as Rancho Santa Margarita via Antonio Parkway, and south to La Pata and San Clemente where they can connect to the I-5 Freeway from Avenida Vista Hermosa. In addition, the future construction of Los Patrones Parkway would establish a new “toll road to freeway” network, starting from the current terminus of the SR-241 toll road, and heading south along Los Patrones Parkway, to Cow Camp Road, and then south again along Antonio Parkway/La Pata Road to Avenida Vista Hermosa.


Water Wise

As ranchers, developers, and stewards of one of the largest land reserves in the state of California, procuring a regular supply of water is essential to nearly every operation conducted on The Ranch including ranching and farming, the management of on-site leases, the protection of open spaces on the Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo, as well as phased residential and commercial development.
 PROVIDING A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY
  In 2004, the County of Orange approved the Rancho Mission Viejo Environmental Impact Report (EIR) which includes a detailed analysis of the Ranch’s water sources, current and future projected demand from development, and water availability to demonstrate the availability of water supply for average, single dry-year and multiple dry-year rainfall conditions. In addition, analyses were conducted to determine the adequacy of water conveyance and/or storage facilities and the certainty of regulatory permitting for development-related projects yet to be implemented.
  Santa Margarita Water District (SMWD) is the urban water supplier identified for Rancho Mission Viejo. SMWD is a regulated public utility which also serves various cities and the unincorporated territory in southeast Orange County. Rancho Mission Viejo is wholly within SMWD’s service area.
 REDUCING WATER DEMAND
  While today’s new homes use about 50% less water than most older homes, Rancho Mission Viejo continues to lead the housing industry in implementing programs which help reduce water demand through the use of drought tolerant landscaping along with modern irrigation techniques.
  In fact, through a partnership between SMWD and the Rancho Mission Viejo family, a new comprehensive landscape water conservation program was created to reduce the water footprint at each of the villages on Rancho Mission Viejo. To date, we’ve reduced annual domestic water demand at the villages on The Ranch from 8,500 acre-feet to about 5,700 acre-feet resulting in an overall 33% reduction.
WATER-WISE PROGRAMS TO REDUCE DEMAND




Approximately 93% of the common areas at the village of Sendero (and the four 55-plus neighborhoods of Gavilán®) as well as nearly 100% of all common areas at the new village of Esencia are irrigated with recycled water.
Due to advancements in efficiency, use of drip irrigation, and focusing on water-wise landscaping, the average residential landscape use on Rancho Mission Viejo is HALF of that for homes built 30 years ago.
Weather-based control timers adjust home irrigation based on local weather changes so that water use is monitored and adjusted based on climate variances and other factors. PLUS the common area irrigation system is controlled by a sophisticated computer program that communicates with onsite weather stations, control timers, and system sensors to manipulate how long and how often water is provided.
The use of water-wise planting on Rancho Mission Viejo has increased 166% to help reduce irrigation demand. FOR EXAMPLE, only 10% of Rancho Mission Viejo common areas use turf grass. And, the turf grass species on Rancho Mission Viejo is called PASPALUM which uses 20% less water than traditional turf, has high salt tolerance for use with recycled water, and has excellent durability for high traffic use in functional areas – such as parks and village greens.
Slope position and orientation also affect irrigation design and water management. For example, the north facing slopes on The Ranch use 40% less water than the south facing slopes. In addition the bottom of a slope uses 25% less water than the top of the slope. Given this, there are over 2,000 control values to manage water use for the various slope zones at Sendero.
All of the water used for grading is recycled or from non-potable water supplies, thereby avoiding strains on domestic water demand.



 ENSURING WATER QUALITY AND PRESERVING WETLANDS AND THE WATERSHED
  Preserving downstream water quality, protecting the stability of local creeks and watersheds, as well as promoting on-site wetlands/riparian habitat protection has been an on-going priority for the Rancho Mission Viejo family for decades.
GERA
  On Earth Day, April 14, 1994, the 105-acre Gobernadora Ecological Restoration Area (GERA) was created on Ranchlands in corporation between the Ranch family and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Originally established as mitigation for the building of new roads, schools and other facilities, GERA has since become recognized as one of the most successful transformations of former farmlands into wetlands and woodlands.
SCIENTIFIC STUDY TO PROTECT THE WATERSHED
  In 1999, a series of scientific studies on the remaining 23,000 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo were expanded to include an U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) program to preserve and enhance wetlands, manage water run-off, and protect water quality in the San Juan and Santa Mateo creeks. This research, combined with the identification of ranchlands containing native habitat of threatened and endangered animals, became the environmental blueprint for the establishment of the Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo and those lands identified for development. This research was expanded under leadership of the County of Orange and funded by Rancho Mission Viejo to analyze the 173 square mile watershed of the San Juan Creek to understand rainfall runoff, risk for flooding, and effects of erosion.
RIVERINES AND BASINS
  In the early 2000s, Rancho Mission Viejo began working in partnership with the County of Orange, SMWD, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the CA Dept. of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the ACOE on a complex “riverine” system at Ladera Ranch designed to reduce storm water runoff, preserve downstream water quality, protect the stability of Trabuco Creek, and promote on-site wetlands/riparian habitat restoration.
  Through a narrow, 2.4-mile manmade seasonal creek bed or “riverine,” rain water and water from sprinklers, pools and other neighborhood sources are collected in a network of drains which are connected to the riverine. As it periodically and seasonally fills with water, the riverine carries water on a course that passes through specially planted reeds and other flora, which serve as natural filters and water purifiers. Ultimately, the water enters the Horno Basin (and the most southern end of Ladera Ranch) for further filtration.
  Over its 34 acres, the Horno Basin includes a water quality control basin and wetland, a retarding basin, a “smart diversion” system, and a forebay for collecting sediment. Together, the riverine and Horno Basin serves several functions including water quality control, trash/debris collection, wetlands and habitat restoration, water reclamation, and storm water detention.
GERA REVISITED
  Based on the success of Ladera Ranch’s “riverine” system, Rancho Mission Viejo has collaborated with SMWD and Orange County Public Works on the new Gobernadora Multi-Purpose Basin facility. Upon completion, the Basin will include multiple storage basins which work together to capture, treat, and reuse storm water and dry weather urban water runoff from Coto de Caza once it flows into the Gobernadora Creek watershed. Water not diverted for non-potable water use will be infiltrated into the local groundwater table and sent downstream for sustaining natural riverine areas.
  Key to the Gobernadora Basin facility will be its erosion control system to protect GERA and endangered bird species. Water conveyed into the Basin through a naturalized treatment system will be treated as it moves through an 11-acre wetlands which includes vegetation which filters and absorb pollutants and emits oxygen to enhance air quality. The use of this natural biological water treatment system will prevent the need for any power use in the treatment process since water will flow from one basin to the next via gravity. It also will prevent the discharge of polluted runoff into streams and important habitat areas. Plus, by controlling water flows through the Basin, excess erosion will be prevented and downstream habitat will be preserved.

innovative Dining Programs
Every day, we deliver engaging, nutrition-focused dining programs to patients around the world.


READ MORE








In today’s healthcare environment, patients have many choices for where they receive their care. We also understand that engaging, quality dining services can improve patient satisfaction and, in turn, drive reimbursement. Fortunately, we’ve spent nearly 50 years partnering with hospitals and healthcare systems across the globe, providing innovative patient dining and clinical nutrition services that meet the strict dietary needs of hundreds of thousands of patients. 
Patient Insights
Each year, we invest significant resources to understand the needs and desires of our patients. Our ability to respond to patient needs, and deliver the nutritious food choices that they want, is what makes us an industry leader. 
Through focus group discussions, close examination of global and local food trends and site-specific research on your patients’ unique food preferences, we’re able to create engaging patient dining experiences that meet their unique dietary needs while also considering the quality and financial goals of the hospitals or health systems we serve. 
Innovative, Engaging Dining Concepts
Armed with those insights, we design and develop innovative programs based on the following:

Quality of food
Menu choice and variety
Quality of service
Nutrition education to support lifestyle change
Patient engagement

















We’re constantly creating new dining concepts and programs to increase patient satisfaction, including:

A high-performance team of specialists that use Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics standards to develop nutritionally sound meal options
Great-tasting, healthier choices that meet dietary needs based on age, regional taste, condition and individual patient preference
Increased room service delivery options, including adding Just For You® state-of-the-art customized nutritional menus to our restaurant-style Room Service Program.
Tray management programs
Hospitality platforms, such as our adopt-a-floor nurse manager rounding program and PatientConnect patient rounding program
Engaging nutrition education to support lifestyle change supported by 750 dietitians

We understand healthcare is a dynamic industry. And it’s for that very reason we put so much emphasis on turning patient insights into everyday innovations. That way, as healthcare evolves, our patient dining services evolve with it.

Patient Engagement
Our employees foster a comforting healthcare environment through everyday patient interactions.


READ MORE








Research has shown that during a three-day hospital stay, patients can encounter as many as 75 different faces. Combine that with an already unfamiliar environment and it can produce a great deal of stress and anxiety. That makes it all the more important to create comforting, engaging patient dining experiences filled with nutritious, satisfying meals. In our experience, these personal touches not only improve health, but can also boost morale. 
Giving Patients What They Want
As with anything we do, we begin with research, by understanding patients through in-depth studies into their behaviors, desires and trends. For example, data shows that patients consider their food choices to be one of the only elements of their hospital stay under their control. So we work with culinary experts to create menus that are full of rich, nutritious choices that improve patient satisfaction.
Bedside Manner
We also know that engaging patients at the bedside helps patients feel more comfortable. Investing in patient- and caregiver-focused customer service programs helps our team understand the nuances of patient interaction, tray accuracy, tray delivery and pickup, diet needs and nutrition intake, among other components. 
Improved Satisfaction
We’re proud to say that nearly 60% of our room service accounts are in the top quartile of patient satisfaction. What’s more, thanks to more efficient operations, we’re able to achieve this satisfaction and financial success without adding additional costs for our healthcare clients.

Clinical Nutrition Services
With over 750 dietitians on staff and a renowned Dietetic Internship Program, we invest in the next generation of clinicians.


READ MORE








Every day, our dietitians deliver superior outcomes by influencing patients to make healthy lifestyle choices and collaborating with caregivers to treat and prevent disease through the use of evidence based practice standards.  As the largest employer of registered dietitians in the United States, we have built a clinical nutrition practice that boasts over 750 dietitians.
Much of our company’s professional development and programmatic strategies are aligned with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. We support dietitians’ performance with state-of-the art tools, programs, and extensive networking opportunities. We incorporate Academy activities into our Clinical Ladders Program and encourage our dietitians’ involvement in the Academy’s Dietetic Practice Groups (DPGs). To help make it easy for them to become involved, we underwrite Academy membership dues, state licensure and certification, and annual Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) fees. We also pay enrollment fees for DPG membership.
Clinical Ladders
Clinical Ladders are recognized levels of achievement within Aramark designed to provide a respected professional growth path for clinicians providing direct patient care. Our Clinical Ladders are in place for entry level through experienced professionals to assist with career growth by recognizing advanced degrees and clinical specialties, advanced practice skills, leadership skills, and research activities. Clinicians follow incremental steps to advance their careers and their professional development. Our Clinical Ladders Program focuses on core component requirements and then asks our clinical dietitians to commit to leadership responsibilities.
Dietetic Internship Program
We live our commitment to clinical professionals through our Dietetic Internship Program. Our program is accredited by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE), which makes us a certified trainer for registered dietitians. Currently, our Dietetic Internship program is conducted at 22 client sites across the country, with a total enrollment of 30 dietitians each year.  In place for 20 years, the program has graduated 584 dietitians.

                                    Across the hospital and healthcare systems we serve, our employees interact with patients, physicians, nursing staff and caregivers several times on a daily basis. Understanding our opportunity to drive physician, caregiver, and patient satisfaction, we identified a way to accelerate communication among our own employees and the patients and staff we engage with every single day. 
                                

See our innovation




Innovation

                                    With that in mind, we created PatientConnect, our proprietary technology platform that enables our operations teams to assess and understand the satisfaction levels of multiple stakeholders and respond immediately to address concerns. This tablet-based app replaces the typical paper-based process for staff to survey patients. The program allows us to improve service, food quality, cleanliness and other critical indicators before the patient leaves the hospital. 

                                

                                        The platform includes a robust data analytics component to measure patient satisfaction scores and interview responses by the type of patient care unit, patient diet type, duration of stay and other variables.

                                    By combining this level of patient engagement with our people-based approach to hospitality services, we were able to improve patient satisfaction significantly. In the 190 locations where PatientConnect is in place, we have seen a 5 percent increase in patient satisfaction, as measured by Press Ganey, a leading provider of third-party patient satisfaction measurement and monitoring.

Environmental Hygiene
A comprehensive approach to environmental cleaning helps ensure your staff can clean with confidence.


READ MORE








In every healthcare organization we serve, we’ve made it our mission to help safeguard the health and well-being of patients, physicians, staff and visitors. At the forefront of that effort is environmental hygiene and infection prevention. With our environmental cleaning products and services, we can help you reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections, while making your organization more efficient and easier to manage.
Scientific Wash Process
Our unique science-based washing process combines the latest scientific advancements with laundering best practices to maintain the durability and the integrity of our microfiber products.
Microfiber Cleaning and ATP Monitoring
Another way we’re enhancing your infection prevention program is with our integrated line of microfiber dusters, towels and mops. These products help eliminate cross-contamination risk from ceiling to floor and are designed for optimal soil and microorganism removal. 
We employ a multistep process called MicroVantage™ to help preserve the effectiveness of our microfiber products and provide you with a comprehensive approach to environmental cleaning, including ATP Monitoring.


Research shows frequently touched surfaces, like bed rails, IV poles and tray tables may still be contaminated after standard cleaning processes. ATP, or Adenosine Triphosphate, is present in all living or once living organisms. Using a luminometer, we’re able to detect ATP on frequently touched surfaces and identify areas where new contaminants could multiply and grow. Doing so may help improve your cleaning practices to reduce risk and provide a safer, healthier patient environment. With our unique ATP monitoring program, we help prevent the spread of these lingering contaminants and ensure a cleaner clean.

Retail Transformation
Our dining environments provide engaging, attractive spaces for caregivers and visitors to recharge.


READ MORE








Many hospital and health system staff members, as well as visitors, choose to eat on-site several times per week. We are able to transform the retail dining experience and deliver a wide variety of great-tasting menus and engaging dining concepts. By doing so, we can both improve the profitability of your dining venues and create an environment where clinicians and visitors can recharge and renew, so that they can focus their energies on what’s most important—patients.
Insight-Driven Transformations
How do we transform the retail dining experience? We start by collecting insights on the trends and behaviors of your customers. This allows us to create innovative, scalable solutions that achieve the highest possible satisfaction for visitors and staff, and the best outcomes for our clients.
Programs and Practices
Our approach to transforming the retail dining experience integrates exciting and inventive programs and practices that respond to your patient, staff and visitor needs, including:

Innovative, great-tasting dishes designed by our certified chefs
Popular national and local restaurant chains, including Starbucks, Subway and Au Bon Pain
Off-hours and small-site solutions
Healthier food choices and engaging health and wellness awareness programs
Robust customer feedback and engagement tools and programs
Competitive catering programs for executive meetings, receptions, conferences and special events
Attractive retail dining environments strategically designed based on location, traffic flow, preference and budget. 

We’re able to replicate our retail transformations, across entire health systems, allowing our commitment to quality and service excellence to be carried out consistently across all your healthcare locations. We do all this while controlling costs and supporting our clients with world-class support and resources. 
Marketing and Engagement
Our robust marketing and communication program includes a combination of traditional marketing, web resources, social media, customized apps, and proprietary programs. Meanwhile, our customer service and support staff delivers quality, innovation, value and variety at all the retail dining locations we serve.

Research and Insights
Insights gathered from your physicians, staff and visitors guide all our healthcare dining programs.


READ MORE








Visitors and caregivers are often pressed for time. Our focus on visitor and caregiver insights allows us to create convenient, compelling programs that your customers are asking for, keeping visitors and caregivers engaged and on campus.
The Insights That Matter
Knowing what caregivers and visitors want out of their dining experience helps us identify what is being done well and what opportunities we have to innovate going forward. We continue to conduct rigorous research into what the staff and visitors at your specific healthcare organization are looking for, and then we turn those insights into exciting innovations. We look at sales data, growing trends and gather information directly from the people who move in and out of your healthcare site every day. 
Feedback and Response
With our proprietary satisfaction survey process, Your Voice Counts, we’re able to respond to visitors and staff needs in real time. The program enables our customers to tell us exactly what they liked and what they’re looking for in their retail dining experience. Then, based on the feedback we get, alerts are automatically distributed to our managers in real time so that they can immediately make changes and applaud service excellence. 
Fostering this open communication—truly listening and responding to ideas, thoughts, and feedback—makes Aramark better, and ensures staff and visitors are engaged and satisfied with their dining experience. We are able to respond to customer needs in a timely fashion, make informed improvements and help increase satisfaction and revenue at hospitals and health systems around the country.

Health and Wellness
Satisfying, nutritious dining services help your healthcare organization promote healthier choices.


READ MORE








Patients and communities look to hospitals and health systems to create a culture focused on wellness and healthy living. The dining options they provide are an important extension of that effort. So we’ve introduced our health and wellness platform, Healthy for Life™, at all the healthcare organizations we serve as part of our commitment to creating healthy environments, building healthier communities and supporting healthy lifestyles.
Healthy Choices
Healthy For Life™ makes healthier choices readily available and positively impacts the healthcare environment. It includes a wide variety of easy-to-find solutions that work together to encourage customers to select the lower-calorie, lower-fat, wholegrain, and vegetarian or vegan choices that best fit their lifestyles. 
Our team of talented chefs and dietitians design menus that are great-tasting, healthy and accommodate a wide variety of unique clinical and nutritional needs, filling the retail-dining environment with an abundance of wholesome, fresh and nutritious foods. 
Through ongoing partnerships with leading healthcare institutions, health advocacy organizations, and industry and community groups, we are working hard every day to make the best menu choices and nutrition information available to your physicians, caregivers, staff and visitors. 
Education and Awareness
Using our own research, as well as in-depth analysis of global health trends, we educate and promote healthier lifestyle choices to care teams, visitors and patients. Through a broad selection of satisfying, healthier recipes, alongside easy-to-understand nutrition and wellness information, we take the mystery out of healthy living. 
We continuously engage and educate customers with activities like on-site health fairs, food sampling events, cooking demonstrations by our chefs, and wellness workshops with our dietitians.

                                    As a global healthcare support services provider, our approach has always been grounded in insights gathered from our patients, hospital staff and visitors. So our team was in need of a system that not only gathered these insights, but would also help us improve our services on a day-to-day basis.

Drawing on our depth of experience, we integrate the quantitative and qualitative data we gather from the program into our daily operations. We then use the data we collect to develop exciting retail dining concepts, which delight customers and build loyalty.

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles

Where is Esencia? Describe the sort of views associated with this village.
Dramatically rising from the floor of the San Juan Valley in South Orange County and situated along some of the highest elevations in the heart of The Ranch is Esencia (Spanish translation: the essence). Esencia encompasses 890 acres of westerly-facing hills which afford both coastal views and backcountry panoramas. More specifically, Esencia is located east of the intersection of Ortega Highway and Antonio Parkway/La Pata Road, and along the first segments of Cow Camp Road — on Rancho Mission Viejo, in unincorporated South Orange County.
How many homes are planned for Esencia?
At build-out, the village of Esencia is planned to provide an integrated mix of 2,537 homes offered for sale to people of all ages and life stages including “Gavilán®” neighborhoods of primarily single-story homes for people age 55-plus. The first collection of homes offered for sale at Esencia were part of The Canyon House Neighborhoods, which introduced a new model for inter-generational living by integrating Gavilán® 55-plus neighborhoods into Esencia’s all age neighborhoods. Homes in The Canyon House Neighborhoods are currently priced from the high $400,000s to over $1 million.
 The next collection of homes at Esencia, known as The Hilltop Neighborhoods, will continue this level of integration around an inter-generational recreational and social amenity called The Hilltop Club. The Hilltop Neighborhoods are slated to debut in Fall 2016.
What are the prices of homes to be offered within the first new-home collection at Esencia?
Homes in The Canyon House Neighborhoods at Esencia are currently priced from the high $400,000s to over $1 million. Home prices have not been released for The Hilltop Neighborhoods.
How can I get on a priority purchase list for the next release of homes in Esencia?
Homes are sold through the individual Esencia neighborhood homebuilders, who create and implement their own sales and purchase procedures and protocols. The best way to learn more about neighborhood homebuilder procedures and protocols as well as participate in invitation-only homeshopper events is to visit www.RanchoMissionViejo.com, click on “Sign Up,” and complete the simple online form. Or, visit the neighborhood of your dreams at Esencia and talk to the homebuilder.
What types and sizes of homes are offered for sale at Esencia? Who are the homebuilders?
The Canyon House Neighborhoods include both attached townhomes and single-family detached homes offering interiors ranging from approximately 1,460 to more than 3,760 square feet.

  The homebuilders selected to construct and sell the six new Hilltop Neighborhoods at Esencia include Del Webb Homes and CalAtlantic Homes who will build new Gavilán® neighborhoods exclusive to residents age 55-plus, while Meritage Homes, MBK Homes, Warmington Residential, and William Lyon Homes will build the brand new all age neighborhoods within The Hilltop Neighborhoods. Combined, the six homebuilders will offer 522 homes for sale within six different and brand new Hilltop Neighborhoods terraced along hillsides to afford panoramic ocean and territorial views of the vast Rancho Mission Viejo.
How many apartment units are planned for Esencia? Who will build/manage/lease these apartments? When will they be ready for leasing/move-in? What are anticipated monthly rents for these apartment units?
Esencia is expected to include about 262 apartment homes. No information is currently available regarding the start of construction of the apartment homes at Esencia; and rents have not been established. Download apartment fact sheet.
Who is the master-planner and developer of Esencia and the Rancho Mission Viejo community?
Rancho Mission Viejo, LLC is a privately held, family-owned and -operated company responsible for the ranching, farming, planning, development, and financial management of the remaining 23,000 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo.
  Since 1882, members of the O’Neill/Avery/Moiso family have owned and managed The Ranch which once exceeded 200,000 acres and now includes the family-developed cities and communities of Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, Las Flores, and Ladera Ranch as well as such important places as Caspers Wilderness Regional Park, the Starr Ranch Audubon Sanctuary, O’Neill Regional Park and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

  PLUS, approximately 50 acres of commercial space is envisioned at Esencia for such uses as retail shops and services, restaurants, professional offices, and more.


CFDs/Mello-Roos/Other Fees

Will residents of Esencia be assessed CFD or Mello-Roos fees? If so, how much is the assessment?
As background, Community Facilities Districts (CFDs) are established by cities, counties and local government agencies as a means of obtaining tax-exempt funding (through the sale of bonds) for the construction/improvement of public facilities and key infrastructure including streets, water systems, sewage and drainage facilities, schools, public parks, as well as police and fire facilities which serve newly developing areas.
  Today, government agencies serving the vast majority of new master-planned communities in California have found that CFD funding is beneficial to homeowners because it facilitates the early construction of essential public facilities and improvements as well as reduces home prices and down payments by financing essential public facilities and improvements at tax-exempt interest rates, over a long period of time (INSTEAD OF ADDING THE COST OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PRICE OF EACH NEW HOME).
WHY/WHEN
  Prior to the passage of California Proposition 13 in 1978, Federal funding for key infrastructure was substantial AND local property taxes were commonly 2.3% and increasing as home prices skyrocketed. However, starting in 1978, Prop. 13 restricted property taxes to just 1.0% of assessed home values; and allowed only 2.0% increases in assessed value per year – just as significant population increases were occurring and Federal funding to California for new infrastructure funding was declining. As a result, cash-strapped cities, counties and government agencies were forced to find new ways to fund new schools and other public facilities and improvements to meet the needs of the state’s growing population. Led by California Senator Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville) and California Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), the Community Facilities Act (commonly called Mello-Roos) was enacted by the California State Legislature in 1982. This legislation allowed the formation of CFDs.
HOW
  At Esencia on The Ranch, determination of each home’s CFD tax (aka Mello-Roos tax) is based on the type of the home and its square footage. The CFD tax formula sets the amount of the CFD tax for each home even before it’s purchased; and the tax is then included in each new home’s property tax bills or added to impound accounts. The overall total annual property tax rate paid by a new homeowner within a CFD includes the 1.0% of assessed value per Prop. 13 PLUS any existing government-issued bonds PLUS the CFD tax and all other property tax assessments. COMBINED, that total annual property tax rate is targeted to not exceed 2% of the assessed value of the property and can be adjusted upward each year by 2%.
WHO/WHERE
  At Esencia on The Ranch, a CFD was formed to fund a wide range of public projects including the following: the construction, purchase, modification, expansion and/or improvement of certain roadways and roadway improvements (including, without limitation, the Foothill Transportation Corridor improvements and the South County Roadway Improvement Program – SCRIP), tunnels, regional hiking and biking trails, storm drains, water and wastewater facilities (including, without limitation, domestic and non-domestic water facilities, wells, reservoirs, pipelines, storm and sewer drains and related infrastructure and improvements), wet and dry utilities, bridges and pedestrian bridges, parks, traffic signals, school facilities and equipment, sheriff’s substations and equipment and library facilities and equipment, and related infrastructure improvements, both onsite and offsite, and all appurtenances and appurtenant work in connection with the foregoing (including utility line relocations and electric, gas and cable utilities).
  The overall total annual property tax rate paid by new Esencia homeowners within this CFD will be approximately 1.8% of the base home prices for owners of homes in the 55+ Gavilán® neighborhoods and approximately 2% of the base home price for all other Esencia homeowners. (Base home prices do not include any home upgrades and/or view premiums.) This total annual property tax rate will include the 1.0% base per Prop. 13 PLUS any existing government-issued bonds PLUS CFD taxes and all other property tax assessments. So, CFD taxes will be a portion of the overall annual property tax rate which is expected not to exceed 1.8% for 55+ neighborhoods or 2% for all other neighborhoods at Esencia.
COMPARE/CONTRAST
  That means that Esencia residents could pay as little as approximately $3,710 annually and as much as approximately $10,235 annually in CFD taxes – with the bulk of residents paying between approximately $4,000 and $6,750 annually. As a point of comparison, homebuyers in one of the newest areas of Irvine are paying an average of $8,590 annually in CFD taxes while those residing in the newest neighborhoods along the San Clemente coast are paying an average of $9,922 in CFD taxes.
  Esencia neighborhood homebuilders are required to disclose to homebuyers their maximum CFD taxes prior to purchase. Neighborhood homebuilders also can provide information about how to prepay the Esencia CFD taxes. Please consult your financial advisor or CPA for all tax advice.
Are there additional fees assessed for maintenance of the village and more?
A fee is collected on initial home sales by neighborhood homebuilders and on the resale of all Ranch homes to fund an important Community Services Organization called RanchLife. RanchLife is unique to Rancho Mission Viejo and each of its villages in that it funds a full calendar of Ranch-resident recreational and educational programs (i.e., fitness classes, happy hours and personal enrichment classes), community-wide events (i.e., holiday festivities, celebrations, and concerts), Ranch resident-led clubs (i.e., biking, photography, hiking, bocce, gardening, mommy and me, wine and dine, and more), a community-wide web portal, and program collaboration with various Ranch partners.
  In addition, all Rancho Mission Viejo homeowners pay a monthly master homeowners associations fee through the Ranch Master Maintenance Corporation or Rancho MCC. Rancho MMC funds the management and maintenance of Rancho Mission Viejo’s many community recreational amenities and facilities including each of the clubhouses at Sendero and those under construction and planned for Esencia as well as all the community farms, parks, common area landscaping, hardscape, lighting, trails, and monumentation as well as related staffing and administration. The monthly general Rancho MCC assessment for Esencia homeowners equals $164/mo.
  Additional fees will be assessed for other purposes including attached-home sub-associations and/or “special benefit areas” (i.e., covering the maintenance of slopes, alley areas, gated neighborhoods, and more).


Schools

What school will Esencia students attend; and within what school district?
Esencia students attending public schools will attend schools within the Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD). Founded in 1965, CUSD encompasses 195 square miles in seven cities and portions of unincorporated Orange County (including Sendero, Esencia and additonal villages planned for The Ranch). Over the last few decades, CUSD has grown in both size and acclaim, earning more than 50 California Distinguished School recognitions and approximately a dozen National Blue Ribbon recognitions.
Esencia K-8
  CUSD, in partnership with Rancho Mission Viejo, LLC (community planner and master developer), has already selected a site at Esencia for the new Esencia K-8 school campus. Planned to be built adjacent to the school is a community park with a joint-use multi-purpose building, open play area, a children’s playground, and a barbeque garden.
 Esencia K-8 school is currently estimated to open for instruction in Fall 2018.
  In the meantime, CUSD has indicated that Esencia students will attend Las Flores Elementary School, Las Flores Middle School, and Tesoro High School. For current information on attendance boundaries, please contact CUSD directly at 949-234-9200.

  Among those K-12 private schools now operating within the adjacent communities of San Juan Capistrano and Ladera Ranch are Capistrano Valley Christian Schools (PK-12), Capo Beach Christian School (K-8), Heart Christian Preparatory Academy (K-8), J Serra Catholic High School (9-12), Mission Basilica School (PR-8), Rancho Capistrano Christian School (K-8), Coastal Mountain Youth Academy (8-12), Saddleback Valley Christian School (K-12), St. Margaret’s Episcopal School (K-12), Umana Academy of Fine Arts (K-8) and numerous others in the South Orange County area.
Colleges/Universities
  Within the local area are numerous colleges and universities including the following: Brandman University, California State University at Fullerton (Irvine Campus), Concordia University, Pepperdine University – Irvine Campus, Saddleback College, SOKA University, and University of California, Irvine.


Trails and The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo

Describe the trails planned for Esencia. Will they lead into open spaces and connect with Regional trails?
The walking, biking and NEV (Neighborhood Electric Vehicle) trails of Esencia are part of a larger Ranch-wide trail system which provides passage throughout Esencia, links with the village of Sendero and its amenities, as well as connects with hiking/biking trails accessing select Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo trails and a County Regional hiking and biking trails network (leading from O’Neill Regional Park into San Juan Capistrano and down to Doheny State Beach). Additional regional trails are planned. In addition, the trails of Esencia connect homes to special signature places within the village including The Canyon House and its adjacent Oak Canyon, Esencia Farm, and the future Hilltop Club (now under construction) as well as the additional amenities planned for Esencia.
How do Esencia and other Rancho Mission Viejo residents access The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo and its habitat reserve lands?
Approximately 75% of the 23,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo will be preserved as part of the protected open spaces of The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo. Only 25% of The Ranch will be developed into the villages of Rancho Mission Viejo (starting with Sendero and now continuing with Esencia). Combined with additional open spaces already dedicated by Rancho Mission Viejo, The Reserve will grow incrementally; and over time, it’s planned to be combined with County-owned lands to form the 33,000-acre Southern Subregion Habitat Reserve, one of California’s largest and most diverse habitat reserves.
  While the primary goal of The Reserve is to focus on habitat study and conservation, all sorts of programs and activities (including docent-led trail walks) are conducted year-round – with many offered exclusively to Ranch residents, including everyone living at Esencia. As Ranch residents, Esencia residents will be offered to join-in on such fun events as Knee High Naturalists activities, Rambles on the Ranch, camping, stargazing, and so much more. To learn about The Reserve, visit www.RMVReserve.org.


Roads and Transportation

What new roads will be built to meet the transportation demands associated with Esencia and future residents on The Ranch?
The South County Road Improvement Program or SCRIP phases the funding and construction of numerous transportation improvements with new development on Rancho Mission Viejo (and possibly other development areas in South Orange County, as needed).
  Under SCRIP, several new improvements have already been made to help address roadway and traffic conditions in the Sendero area, including the following:




Widening of sections of Ortega Highway, Antonio Parkway, and La Pata Road
Installation of drainage facilities, water quality improvements and additional underground utilities
Construction of a new 300-ft long, two-lane bridge with barrier railing over San Juan Creek
Stabilization of the Creek edge to secure trail and maintenance access for County use



  SCRIP is administered by Orange County Public Works.
Cow Camp Road
  Also included in the County of Orange-approved SCRIP plan is Cow Camp Road, designated in the County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways as an east-west Major and Primary Arterial Highway. Slated to be built in two phase, Cow Camp Road will ultimately provide three lanes in each direction (for a total of six lanes) beginning at Antonio Parkway and extending four miles to the east where it will connect with Ortega Highway, near Caspers Wilderness Park. The first phase (nearly 1.5 miles) of Cow Camp Road is now open from Antonio Parkway to a location near the future intersection of Los Patrones Parkway at the eastern edge of Esencia.
  Key to the first phase of Cow Camp Road has been the design, engineering and construction of the Chiquita Canyon Bridge which spans 1,420 linear feet long and rises 75 feet above the protected open spaces of Chiquita Canyon.
  In addition to affording quick access to Esencia, Cow Camp Road will benefit local residents by providing alternative routes to existing arterials (including Ortega Highway and the I-5 Freeway) as well as quick access to the SR-241 toll road (aka the FTC or Foothill Toll Road/Transportation Corridor) at Oso Parkway via the future construction of Los Patrones Parkway.
Los Patrones Parkway (Connecting Cow Camp Road to the SR-241 Toll Road)
  Not included in SCRIP yet identified as part of the County of Orange’s 2004-approved transportation program for Rancho Mission Viejo is Los Patrones Parkway (formerly known as “F” Street), identified as a secondary arterial linking Cow Camp Road to the current Oso Parkway terminus of the SR-241 toll road (aka FTC or Foothill Toll Road/Transportation Corridor). The Transportation Corridor Agencies has announced its intention to place a toll charge on Los Patrones Parkway, between Cow Camp Road and Oso Parkway.
Extension of La Pata Road (241 Toll Road to I-5 Freeway Connection)
  The extension of La Pata Road from Ortega Highway, south to Avenida Vista Hermosa is now open. This new route will establish an important South Orange County parallel to the I-5 Freeway, allowing commuters to bypass the I-5 as they travel from as far north as Rancho Santa Margarita via Antonio Parkway, and south to La Pata and San Clemente where they can connect to the I-5 Freeway from Avenida Vista Hermosa. In addition, the future construction of Los Patrones Parkway would establish a new “toll road to freeway” network, starting from the current terminus of the SR-241 toll road, and heading south along Los Patrones Parkway, to Cow Camp Road, and then south again along Antonio Parkway/La Pata Road to Avenida Vista Hermosa.


Water Wise

As ranchers, developers, and stewards of one of the largest land reserves in the state of California, procuring a regular supply of water is essential to nearly every operation conducted on The Ranch including ranching and farming, the management of on-site leases, the protection of open spaces on the Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo, as well as phased residential and commercial development.
 PROVIDING A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY
  In 2004, the County of Orange approved the Rancho Mission Viejo Environmental Impact Report (EIR) which includes a detailed analysis of the Ranch’s water sources, current and future projected demand from development, and water availability to demonstrate the availability of water supply for average, single dry-year and multiple dry-year rainfall conditions. In addition, analyses were conducted to determine the adequacy of water conveyance and/or storage facilities and the certainty of regulatory permitting for development-related projects yet to be implemented.
  Santa Margarita Water District (SMWD) is the urban water supplier identified for Rancho Mission Viejo. SMWD is a regulated public utility which also serves various cities and the unincorporated territory in southeast Orange County. Rancho Mission Viejo is wholly within SMWD’s service area.
 REDUCING WATER DEMAND
  While today’s new homes use about 50% less water than most older homes, Rancho Mission Viejo continues to lead the housing industry in implementing programs which help reduce water demand through the use of drought tolerant landscaping along with modern irrigation techniques.
  In fact, through a partnership between SMWD and the Rancho Mission Viejo family, a new comprehensive landscape water conservation program was created to reduce the water footprint at each of the villages on Rancho Mission Viejo. To date, we’ve reduced annual domestic water demand at the villages on The Ranch from 8,500 acre-feet to about 5,700 acre-feet resulting in an overall 33% reduction.
WATER-WISE PROGRAMS TO REDUCE DEMAND




Approximately 93% of the common areas at the village of Sendero (and the four 55-plus neighborhoods of Gavilán®) as well as nearly 100% of all common areas at the new village of Esencia are irrigated with recycled water.
Due to advancements in efficiency, use of drip irrigation, and focusing on water-wise landscaping, the average residential landscape use on Rancho Mission Viejo is HALF of that for homes built 30 years ago.
Weather-based control timers adjust home irrigation based on local weather changes so that water use is monitored and adjusted based on climate variances and other factors. PLUS the common area irrigation system is controlled by a sophisticated computer program that communicates with onsite weather stations, control timers, and system sensors to manipulate how long and how often water is provided.
The use of water-wise planting on Rancho Mission Viejo has increased 166% to help reduce irrigation demand. FOR EXAMPLE, only 10% of Rancho Mission Viejo common areas use turf grass. And, the turf grass species on Rancho Mission Viejo is called PASPALUM which uses 20% less water than traditional turf, has high salt tolerance for use with recycled water, and has excellent durability for high traffic use in functional areas – such as parks and village greens.
Slope position and orientation also affect irrigation design and water management. For example, the north facing slopes on The Ranch use 40% less water than the south facing slopes. In addition the bottom of a slope uses 25% less water than the top of the slope. Given this, there are over 2,000 control values to manage water use for the various slope zones at Sendero.
All of the water used for grading is recycled or from non-potable water supplies, thereby avoiding strains on domestic water demand.



 ENSURING WATER QUALITY AND PRESERVING WETLANDS AND THE WATERSHED
  Preserving downstream water quality, protecting the stability of local creeks and watersheds, as well as promoting on-site wetlands/riparian habitat protection has been an on-going priority for the Rancho Mission Viejo family for decades.
GERA
  On Earth Day, April 14, 1994, the 105-acre Gobernadora Ecological Restoration Area (GERA) was created on Ranchlands in corporation between the Ranch family and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Originally established as mitigation for the building of new roads, schools and other facilities, GERA has since become recognized as one of the most successful transformations of former farmlands into wetlands and woodlands.
SCIENTIFIC STUDY TO PROTECT THE WATERSHED
  In 1999, a series of scientific studies on the remaining 23,000 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo were expanded to include an U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) program to preserve and enhance wetlands, manage water run-off, and protect water quality in the San Juan and Santa Mateo creeks. This research, combined with the identification of ranchlands containing native habitat of threatened and endangered animals, became the environmental blueprint for the establishment of the Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo and those lands identified for development. This research was expanded under leadership of the County of Orange and funded by Rancho Mission Viejo to analyze the 173 square mile watershed of the San Juan Creek to understand rainfall runoff, risk for flooding, and effects of erosion.
RIVERINES AND BASINS
  In the early 2000s, Rancho Mission Viejo began working in partnership with the County of Orange, SMWD, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the CA Dept. of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the ACOE on a complex “riverine” system at Ladera Ranch designed to reduce storm water runoff, preserve downstream water quality, protect the stability of Trabuco Creek, and promote on-site wetlands/riparian habitat restoration.
  Through a narrow, 2.4-mile manmade seasonal creek bed or “riverine,” rain water and water from sprinklers, pools and other neighborhood sources are collected in a network of drains which are connected to the riverine. As it periodically and seasonally fills with water, the riverine carries water on a course that passes through specially planted reeds and other flora, which serve as natural filters and water purifiers. Ultimately, the water enters the Horno Basin (and the most southern end of Ladera Ranch) for further filtration.
  Over its 34 acres, the Horno Basin includes a water quality control basin and wetland, a retarding basin, a “smart diversion” system, and a forebay for collecting sediment. Together, the riverine and Horno Basin serves several functions including water quality control, trash/debris collection, wetlands and habitat restoration, water reclamation, and storm water detention.
GERA REVISITED
  Based on the success of Ladera Ranch’s “riverine” system, Rancho Mission Viejo has collaborated with SMWD and Orange County Public Works on the new Gobernadora Multi-Purpose Basin facility. Upon completion, the Basin will include multiple storage basins which work together to capture, treat, and reuse storm water and dry weather urban water runoff from Coto de Caza once it flows into the Gobernadora Creek watershed. Water not diverted for non-potable water use will be infiltrated into the local groundwater table and sent downstream for sustaining natural riverine areas.
  Key to the Gobernadora Basin facility will be its erosion control system to protect GERA and endangered bird species. Water conveyed into the Basin through a naturalized treatment system will be treated as it moves through an 11-acre wetlands which includes vegetation which filters and absorb pollutants and emits oxygen to enhance air quality. The use of this natural biological water treatment system will prevent the need for any power use in the treatment process since water will flow from one basin to the next via gravity. It also will prevent the discharge of polluted runoff into streams and important habitat areas. Plus, by controlling water flows through the Basin, excess erosion will be prevented and downstream habitat will be preserved.

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
