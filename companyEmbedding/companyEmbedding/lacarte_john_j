What are analysts saying about NCI stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about NCI stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "NCI, Inc. is a leading provider of information technology services and solutions to U.S. federal government agencies. NCI's award-winning expertise encompasses areas critical to its customers' mission objectives including enterprise systems management, information assurance, network engineering, and systems development and integration.   " (5/13/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "NCIT offers an attractive risk/reward profile as its peer-low valuation (5.9x EV/EBITDA)." (4/10/2017)
3. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We take a neutral perspective on NCI shares for the time being, although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government IT landscape. CEO Paul Dillahay was appointed in October 2016, and we believe he is taking steps to increase NCI’s ability to capture new business. Given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate, the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable. That being said, we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the PEO Soldier contract that we estimate accounted for 16% of revenue in 2016—and there may be a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller. The company does have significant capabilities in agile software development, and we believe management’s approach is inspired; there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future, but for the time being, we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NCI (NASDAQ:NCIT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $18.33 (8.10% downside)

Model Cleaners' LaCarte named Entrepreneur of the Year

Chris Buckley
| Wednesday, 
 June 26, 2013, 12:01 a.m.









Submitted
John LaCarte, center, is joined at the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2013 awards on Saturday, June 22, 2013, by his brothers, from left, Dave LaCarte, general manager of appraisal sales; Joe LaCarte, general manager of uniform operations; Mike LaCarte, general manager of dry cleaning operations; and Dan LaCarte, general manager of retail store and pickup and delivery.

 Waiting patiently throughout the evening to hear his name ultimately called, John LaCarte said with a smile he felt a little like a nominee at the Academy Awards. 
 “They had sealed envelopes and no one knew who won,” LaCarte said. “And we were the last category.” 
 But the waiting was worth it for the president of Model Cleaners and a partner of Fratelli Brothers. LaCarte was named Entrepreneur of the Year for 2013 by Ernst & Young for Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia at the gala held last week at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh. 
 He will now compete for the national awards Nov. 13-17 in Palm Springs, Calif.  
 “The award really recognizes what we've done building a company in the Mon Valley,” LaCarte said. “My message is it's possible, you can invest in places like the Mon Valley.” 
 The company employs nearly 300 at 28 locations in western Pennsylvania and northeastern Ohio. Including its real estate operations, the company has added over 700 jobs to the region. 
 Model Cleaners was formed in 1930 at 140 Lincoln Ave. 
 But Jack LaCarte – John's father – bought Model Cleaners of Charleroi Inc. in 1986.  
 Jack LaCarte serves as general manager of RTS Packaging in Charleroi, where he was first hired in 1980. 
 In 1994, the business was moved to 100 Third St., Charleroi. Although not necessarily chosen for that reason, the former Fib Chem building was familiar to the LaCarte family. It was there that Jack LaCarte's father John J. LaCarte, operated Lock-Fold Paper Box Co. 
 The business expanded into Ohio, acquiring Fussy Cleaners in Akron –owned by their uncle, who passed away in 2008. 
 Operating as Fratelli Partners – translated means Brothers Partners - the firm also has diversified into real estate, including buildings in the Alta Vista industrial park in Fallowfield Township. These include homes for Gardner Denver Nash, Progeny Systems, Exide Technologies and Techno Care. 
 While he was honored, LaCarte said the award recognizes the work that he and his brothers have done to build Model Cleaners. 
 Model now employs leading technologies such as permanent bar codes and multi- read frequency chips to track garments. 
 Model Cleaners has also developed cellular phone applications that allow customers to accomplish task like checking on the status of pick-ups and deliveries. 
 The award continues what LaCarte called “a pretty amazing year.” In March, LaCarte's firm won the Build-to-Suit Industrial Award winner by The National Association Of Industrial and Office Properties, Pittsburgh Chapter. 
 The awards are recognition of the company's mission statement “to care for our customers, community and each other like family.”
