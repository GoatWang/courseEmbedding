John Schumacher

John Schumacher is the founder and director of Unity Woods Yoga Center, Washington’s premier yoga studio. He has practiced yoga for more than 40 years and has taught in the Washington area since 1973. John studied in India with B.K.S. Iyengar for 33 years, and is a certified advanced Iyengar Yoga teacher, one of only 13 teachers in the U.S. to hold that level of certification. John also spent many years studying with internationally acclaimed teacher Dona Holleman.
John’s clear, precise style and his engaging sense of humor have made him one of the country’s leading yoga teachers. Yoga Journal described him as “one of 25 originals shaping yoga in America.” John has written for a variety of publications and has appeared in numerous local and national media, including U.S. News and World Report, The Washington Post, Washingtonian Magazine, The Washington Times, PBS, Yoga Journal, and many others. He has spoken about the practice and benefits of yoga on radio and television and at conferences and events around the nation. In 2007, he was a keynote speaker at the first NIH conference on alternative health.
In over 40 years as a teacher, John has taught thousands of students, including many of the Washington area’s most prominent yoga teachers. He continues to travel across the U.S. and throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean, where he conducts workshops for students and teachers of all levels.
The studio he founded in 1979, Unity Woods Yoga Center, has grown to encompass three locations in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. It is now the largest Iyengar Yoga center in the U.S. and one of the best known and widely respected yoga centers in the country. Over the more than 35 years of its existence, Unity Woods has worked to foster health, serenity, and awareness for more than 45,000 students who have taken classes at the center.

What participants are saying


“This is not trendy yoga. These are not some aerobics teachers that took a weekend training and now consider themselves ‘yoga teachers.’ This is for the serious study of yoga by a studio who has been doing this long before Madonna and the masses. “ [N.S.]

Schumacher, John D
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Schumacher, John D carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Schumacher, John D



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Schumacher, John D



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Historical, unprecedented, and unmatched is what F. Schumacher & Co. is in the world of home décor. How else would you describe a company that had helped decorate the White House, the Chambers of the United States Supreme Court, The Metropolitan Opera and numerous acclaimed residential homes including the Hearst Private Residences? In addition, Schumacher has collaborated with some of the most respected and well-known designers of the 20th century. Their names read like a Mount Rushmore of Décor and design: Paul Poiret, Dorothy Draper, Cecil Beaton and Frank Lloyd Wright. Today, that tradition of working with only the best continues with their relationships with some of the top designers of our time, including Alessandra Branca, Trina Turk and Timothy Corrigan. Collaborations with innovative designers assure the client that Schumacher’s decorative fabrics, wallcoverings, trimmings, and furnishings will always strike a balance between classic elegance and modern sophistication.
The Schumacher collection captures all the look and style of traditional and contemporary designs. Their fabrics are available in an array of textiles, patterns, and prints. The Queen of Spain line is just as bold today, as it was when it was first released in 1963; a repeated leaf pattern on 100% cotton, a striking look available in five bold hues. Serengeti is an eye-catching animal print that is created by a heady mix of texture and color.  Gold Rush is woven with glittering metallic finishes that shimmer and shine with reckless abandon. These fabric lines, as well as countless others, assure Schumacher that they will continue to be the fabric of choice for countless generations. Since 1889, Schumacher has created a collection of luxury home designs that have set the standard for all others to follow. Still privately owned, and operated by the same family for over a century. Today, the Schumacher standard of high-end quality is found in countless trade showrooms across the Americas, in Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.
