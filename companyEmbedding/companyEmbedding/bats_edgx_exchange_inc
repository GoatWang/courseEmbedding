Start Preamble
        
        
        
        August 22, 2016.
        Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),[1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 
           notice is hereby given that on August 11, 2016, Bats EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the “Exchange” or “EDGX”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Exchange has designated this proposal as a “non-controversial” proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [3] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder,[4] 
           which renders it effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange filed a proposal to amend Rule 13.8 to adopt a new market data product known as EDGX Summary Depth.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's Web site at www.batstrading.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
A.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 
1.  Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 13.8 to adopt a new market data product known as EDGX Summary Depth. EDGX Summary Depth would be a data feed that offers aggregated two-sided quotations for all displayed orders entered into the System [5] 

           for up to five (5) price levels for securities traded on the Exchange and for which the Exchange reports quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. EDGX Summary Depth also contains the individual last sale information, Market Status, Trading Status, and Trade Break messages. The individual last sale information will include the price, size, and time of execution. The last sale message will also include the cumulative number of shares executed on the Exchange for that trading day. The Exchange will disseminate the aggregate Best Bid and Offer (“BBO”) and last sale information through EDGX Start Printed Page 58988Summary Depth no earlier than it provides its BBO and last sale information to the processors under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.
The Market Status message will reflect a change in the status of the Exchange. For example, the Market Status message would indicate whether the Exchange is experiencing a systems issue or disruption resulting in quotation or trade information not currently being disseminated as part of the aggregated BBO. The Market Status message will also indicate when Exchange has resolved a systems issue or disruption and is properly reflecting the status of the aggregated BBO. The Trade Break message will indicate when an execution is broken in accordance with Exchange rules.[6] 
           The Trading Status message will indicate the current trading status of a security on the Exchange. For example, a Trading Status message will be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO (“Short Sale Circuit Breaker”),[7] 
           or when the security is subject to a trading halt, suspension or pause declared by the listing market. A Trading Status message will be sent whenever a security's trading status changes.
The Exchange intends to offer EDGX Summary Depth as of January 3, 2017. Prior to January 3, 2017, the Exchange will file a separate rule change with the Commission proposing fees to be charged for EDGX Summary Depth.[8] 

2.  Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act,[9] 
           in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act,[10] 
           in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and to protect investors and the public interest, and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. This proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of EDGX Summary Depth. The Exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with an alternative for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchange-only data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed. The proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to real-time depth-of-book information contained in EDGX Summary Depth.
The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 11(A) of the Act [11] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities to brokers, dealers, and investors. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[12] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. EDGX Summary Depth would be accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis, in that neither the Exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available. Accordingly, distributors and subscribers can discontinue their use at any time and for any reason.
In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition: 
[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.[13] 

By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history.
In addition, EDGX Summary Depth removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by providing investors with alternative market data and competing with similar market data products currently offered by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (“NYSE”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).[14] 
           The provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by Regulation NMS.[15] 

B.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.[16] 
           The Start Printed Page 58989Exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by enabling the Exchange to offer a market data product similar to that currently offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq.[17] 
           Thus, the Exchange believes this proposed rule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national securities exchanges.
C.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
Because the proposed rule change does not (i) significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [18] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.[19] 

At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved.
IV.  Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:

     The Bats One Feed is a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregate BBO of all displayed orders for securities traded on each of the Bats Exchanges and for the Bats Exchanges report quotes under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The Bats One Feed also contains the individual last sale information for the Bats Exchanges (collectively with the aggregate BBO, the “Bats One Summary Feed”). In addition, the Bats One Feed contains optional functionality which enables recipients to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the Bats Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels (“Bats One Premium Feed”). See Exchange Rule 13.8(b). See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 73918 (December 23, 2014), 79 FR 78920 (December 31, 2014) (File Nos. SR-EDGX-2014-25; SR-EDGA-2014-25; SR-BATS-2014-055; SR-BYX-2014-030) (Notice of Amendments No. 2 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, to Establish a New Market Data Product called the Bats One Feed) (“Bats One Approval Order”). The Exchange uses the following data feeds to create the Bats One Feed, each of which are available to vendors: EDGX Depth, EDGA Depth, BYX PITCH Feed, and the BZX PITCH Feed. The Exchange notes that a vendor could utilize the proposed EDGX Summary Depth Feed, as well as the summarized depth feeds to be proposed by BYX, BZX, and EDGA to create a competing product to the Bats One Feed. Supra note 8. The Exchange represents that a competing vendor could obtain these data feeds from each Bats Exchange on the same latency basis as the system that performs the aggregation and consolidation of the Bats One Feed. See Bats One Approval Order. While the proposed EDGX Summary Depth Feed does not contain the symbol summary or consolidated volume data included in the Bats One Feed, a vendor could include this information in a competing product as this information is easily derivable from the proposed feeds or can be obtained from the securities information processors on the same terms as the Exchange.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        December 23, 2014
        I. Introduction
On October 30, 2014, BATS Exchange, Inc. (“BATS”), BATS Y-Exchange, Inc. (“BYX”), EDGA Exchange, Inc. (“EDGA”), and EDGX Exchange, Inc.; (“EDGX”) (collectively, the “Exchanges”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) [1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 

           proposed rule changes to establish a new market data product called the “BATS One Feed.” On November 13, 2014, each of the Exchanges filed an Amendment No. 1 to its proposed rule change. The proposed rule changes, each as amended by an Amendment No. 1, were published for comment in the Federal Register on November 20, 2014.[3] 
           On December 15, 2014, each of the Exchanges filed an Amendment No. 2 to its proposed rule change. On December 15, 2014, each of the Exchanges submitted a comment letter on its proposed rule change, each of which included a redline showing the changes made by their Amendments No. 2.[4] 
           No other comments on the proposed rule changes have been received. However, similar proposed rule changes were filed with the Commission by the Exchanges earlier this year and subsequently withdrawn; [5] 
           three Start Printed Page 78921comment letters were received in response to two of those proposed rule changes.[6] 
           The Commission is publishing this Notice and Order to solicit comment on the Amendments No. 2 and to approve each of the proposed rule changes, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, on an accelerated basis.
II. Description of the Proposals
The Exchanges propose to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed, which would be offered by each of the Exchanges. The BATS One Feed would be a consolidated data feed based on market data derived from underlying data feeds offered by each of the Exchanges. Specifically, the Exchanges would use the following data feeds, which are also available to other vendors, to create the proposed BATS One Feed: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. The Exchanges have represented that they will continue to make these individual underlying feeds available and that, as a result, the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed would be the same as the source available to other vendors. As described more fully below, the BATS One Feed would be a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregate best bid and offer (“BBO”) of all displayed orders for securities traded on the Exchanges and for which the Exchanges report quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The BATS One Feed would also contain the individual last sale information for each of the Exchanges. In addition, the BATS One Feed would include messages from the Exchanges about trading on their markets. Finally, the BATS One Feed would contain an optional functionality that would enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels.
Description of the BATS One Feed
The BATS One Feed would contain the aggregate BBO of the Exchanges for all securities that are traded on the Exchanges and for which the Exchanges report quotes under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The aggregate BBO would include the total size of all orders at the BBO available on all Exchanges.[7] 
           The BATS One Feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual Exchanges. The last sale information would include the price, size, time of execution, and the individual Exchange on which the trade was executed. The last sale message would also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all Exchanges for that trading day. The Exchanges have represented that they would disseminate the aggregate BBO of the Exchanges and last sale information through the BATS One Feed no earlier than each individual Exchange provides its BBO and last sale information to the processors under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.
The BATS One Feed would also include Symbol Summary, Market Status, Retail Liquidity Identifier on behalf of BYX, Trading Status, and Trade Break messages. The Symbol Summary message would include the total executed volume across all of the Exchanges. The Market Status message would be disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the Exchanges. For example, the Market Status message would indicate whether one of the Exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the BATS One Feed as part of the aggregated BBO. The Market Status message would also indicate when an Exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated BBO.
The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicator message would be disseminated via the BATS One Feed on behalf of the BYX only pursuant to BYX's Retail Price Improvement (“RPI”) Program.[8] 

           The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicates when RPI interest priced at least $0.001 better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer for a particular security is available in the System. The Exchanges propose to disseminate the Retail Liquidity Indicator via the BATS One Feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams (i.e., pursuant to the Consolidated Tape Association Plan/Consolidated Quotation Plan, or CTA/CQ, for Tape A and Tape B securities, and the Nasdaq UTP Plan for Tape C securities) as well as through proprietary BYX data feeds. The Retail Liquidity Identifier reflects the symbol and the side (buy or sell) of the RPI interest, but does not include the price or size of the RPI interest. In particular, like CQ and UTP quoting outputs, the BATS One Feed would include a field for codes related to the Retail Price Improvement Identifier. The codes indicate RPI interest that is priced better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the Program.
The Trade Break message would indicate when an execution on one of the Exchanges has been broken in accordance with the individual Exchange's rules.[9] 
           The Trading Status message would indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual Exchange. For example, a Trading Status message would be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO (“Short Sale Circuit Breaker”),[10] 
           or the security is subject to a trading halt, suspension or pause declared by the listing market. A Trading Status message would be sent whenever a security's trading status changes.

Optional Functionality for Aggregate Depth of Book. The BATS One Feed would also offer an additional, optional functionality that would enable recipients to receive two-sided quotations from the Exchanges for five (5) price levels for all securities that are traded on the Exchanges. The option for Start Printed Page 78922receiving the BATS One Feed with this depth of book functionality is referred to as the “BATS One Premium Feed;” the option for receiving the BATS One Feed without this functionality is referred to as the “BATS One Summary Feed.” For each price level on one of the Exchanges, the BATS One Premium Feed option of the BATS One Feed would include a two-sided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level.[11] 


Distribution of the BATS One Feed. The Exchanges represent that they have taken into consideration their affiliated relationships in the design of the BATS One Feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchanges, both from the perspective of latency and cost. The Exchanges have stated that they propose to offer the BATS One Feed voluntarily in response to demand from vendors and subscribers that are interested in receiving the aggregate BBO and last sale information from the Exchanges as part of a single data feed. The Exchanges assert that the BATS One Feed can be used by industry professionals and retail investors looking for a cost effective, easy-to-administer, high quality market data product with the characteristics of the BATS One Feed. The Exchanges also assert that the BATS One Feed would help protect a free and open market by providing vendors and subscribers additional choices in receiving this type of market data, thus promoting competition and innovation.
With respect to latency, the Exchanges have represented that the path for distribution by the Exchanges of BATS One Feed would not be faster than the path for distribution that would be used by a vendor to distribute an independently created a BATS One-like product. Accordingly, the Exchanges have stated, the proposed BATS One data feed is a data product that a competing vendor could create and sell without being in a disadvantaged position relative to the Exchange. In recognition that the Exchanges are the source of their own market data and affiliated with one another, the Exchanges have represented that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is available to other vendors. Specifically, the Exchanges have represented that they would use the following data feeds to create the proposed BATS One Feed, each of which is available to other vendors: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. The Exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available these individual underlying feeds and that, as a result, the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors.
The Exchanges have also made the following representations regarding the latency of the BATS One Feed and any consolidated feed to be offered by a competing vendor. In order to create the BATS One Feed, the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed would need to receive the individual data feeds from each Exchange and, in turn, aggregate and summarize that data to create the BATS One Feed and then distribute it to end users. This is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the BATS One Feed to distribute to its end users. In addition, a competing vendor could locate its servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed and could therefore receive the individual data feeds from each Exchange at the same time as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed. Thus, the Exchanges have stated that they would not have any unfair advantage over competing vendors with respect to obtaining data from the individual Exchanges, because the technology supporting the BATS One Feed would similarly need to obtain the underlying data feeds and because this connection would be on a level playing field with a competing vendor located at the same facility as the Exchanges. Likewise, the BATS One data feed would not have a speed advantage vis-à-vis competing vendors with respect to access to end user customers, whether those end users are also located in the same data center or not.
With regard to cost, the Exchanges have represented that they will file a separate rule filing with the Commission to establish fees for BATS One Feed and that these fees would be designed to ensure that vendors could compete with the Exchanges by creating a similar product. To ensure a vendor can compete with the Exchanges by creating the same product as the BATS One Feed and selling it to their clients, the Exchanges have also represented that they would charge their clients for the BATS One Feed an amount that is no less than the cost to a market data vendor to obtain all the underlying feeds, plus an amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function. Thus, the pricing for the BATS One Feed would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no pricing disadvantage relative to the Exchanges.
Implementation Date
The Exchanges have represented that they anticipate making the BATS One Feed available as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule changes by the Commission and the effectiveness of rule filings to establish the fees for the BATS One Feed.[12] 

III. Summary of Comments
As noted above, the Commission received three comment letters on previous versions of the proposed changes filed by some of the Exchanges.[13] 
           In their current proposals, the Exchanges have responded to the points raised by these commenters.
The three commenters generally oppose the proposed BATS One Feed. The Shatto Letter expressed general concerns about the transparency of order flow information to regulators. The Themis Letter expressed objections to the proposed BATS One Feed on the grounds that it would introduce a new proprietary data feed and expressed concerns generally about the complexity arising from the proliferation of new data technologies. In their response to the commenters, the Exchanges argued that the Themis Letter and Shatto Letter are not responsive to the issues raised in the proposal or are aimed at existing elements of U.S. market structure that have been previously approved by the Commission.
The SIFMA Letter primarily argues that the fees for the proposed BATS One Feed do not meet the requirements of the Act, including the requirement that such fees be “fair and reasonable” under section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act. SIFMA also contends that BATS has circumvented the requirement to receive Commission approval for this product by offering and marketing the BATS One Feed since August 1, 2014. In their response to the SIFMA Letter, the Exchanges noted that the thrust of the SIFMA Letter is aimed at the initially proposed fees, which have now been removed from the proposed rule changes and are to be filed with the Commission via separate rule filings. Start Printed Page 78923The Exchanges also noted that, while the SIFMA Letter correctly states that BATS has marketed the BATS One Feed since August 1, 2014, the SIFMA Letter incorrectly asserts that BATS has offered the BATS One Feed since that same date. The Exchanges have represented that all of their marketing materials have included statements that the BATS One Feed's implementation was pending to Commission approval, and at no point have the Exchanges offered the BATS One product for any use other than for testing and certification.
IV. Discussion and Commission Findings
After carefully considering the proposals and the comments submitted, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges.[14] 
           In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act [15] 
           and with Rule 603(a)(2) of Regulation NMS thereunder,[16] 
           which requires that any national securities exchange, national securities association, broker, or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock to a securities information processor, broker, dealer, or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, and section 6(b)(8) of the Act, which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.[17] 

The Commission notes that, to create the BATS One Feed, the Exchanges would use underlying data feeds that belong to the Exchanges: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. Accordingly, the Commission's review of the Exchanges' proposals has focused, in particular, on whether the proposals would result in affiliated exchanges—which are separate self-regulatory organizations under the Act—making their data products or services available to one another at terms (e.g., content, pricing, or latency) that are more favorable than those available to unaffiliated market participants.
The Exchanges have represented that the BATS One Feed would be created using underlying data feeds that are available for subscription by vendors. In recognition that the Exchanges are the source of their own market data and that they are affiliated with one another, the Exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available all of the individual underlying feeds and that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors.
With respect to latency, the Exchanges have represented that competing vendors could locate their servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed, and, therefore, could receive the underlying data feeds at the same time as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed. Therefore, the Exchanges have contended that, a competing vendor could obtain the underlying data feeds from the Exchanges on the same latency basis as the system that would be performing the aggregation and consolidation of the proposed BATS One Feed and could provide the same kind of product to its customers with the same latency they could achieve by purchasing the BATS One Feed from the Exchanges.[18] 
           The Exchanges have also represented that they have designed the BATS One Feed so that they would have no advantages over a competing vendor with respect to the speed of access to the underlying feeds.
With respect to pricing, although specific fees to be charged for the BATS One Feed are not part of the proposed rule changes, the Exchanges have represented that they will assess a fee that is at least equal to the aggregate cost of the underlying feeds (i.e., at least as much as the cost to a vendor of subscribing to each of the underlying data feeds), plus an additional amount (to be determined) that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function performed to create the BATS One Feed.[19] 

Based on the Exchange's representations with respect to the content, latency, and pricing of the BATS One Feed—which are central to the Commission's analysis of the proposal—the Commission finds that the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. The Commission believes that these representations are designed to ensure that BATS, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX, which are separate self-regulatory organizations, do not, because of their relationship as affiliates, offer one another products or services on a more favorable basis than that available to other competing market participants.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes, as amended, are consistent with section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act and Rule 603(a)(2) of Regulation NMS Start Printed Page 78924thereunder,[20] 
           and sections 6(b)(5) and (b)(8) of the Act.[21] 

V. Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by Amendments No. 2
The Amendments No. 2 revised the proposed rule changes to: (i) Clarify how the BATS One Feed would be created, (ii) make additional clarifying statements with respect to the latency and cost of the BATS One Feed, and (iii) bring together the discussion of key aspects of the description of the proposal in the same section. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the Amendments No. 2 raises any novel regulatory issues and therefore finds that good cause exists to approve the proposals, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, on an accelerated basis.
VI. Solicitation of Comments
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether Amendments No. 2 to the proposed rule changes are consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:

     Section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act requires, among other things, that no self-regulatory organization, member thereof, securities information processor, broker or dealer make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to collect, process, distribute, publish or prepare for distribution or publication any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in any security other than an exempted security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act to assure that all securities information processors may, for purposes of distribution and publication, obtain on fair and reasonable terms such information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as is collected, processed, or prepared for distribution or publication by an exclusive processor of such information acting in such capacity. 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(c)(1)(C).

18.
     The Exchanges have represented that, in order to create the BATS One Feed, the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed would need to receive the underlying data feeds from each Exchange and, in turn, aggregate and summarize that data to create the BATS One Feed and then distribute it to end users. The Exchanges have stated that this is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the BATS One Feed to distribute to its end users.

        Back to Citation
      


19.
     SIFMA has objected to the BATS One Feed primarily over concerns about fees for this product being “fair and reasonable,” consistent with section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act. The Commission notes, however, that the proposed rule changes do not contain proposed fees and that Exchanges have represented that they will not offer the BATS One Feed until the requisite fee filings under section 19(b) of the Act have been filed and are effective. The Commission will review any such filings when they have been submitted.
 SIFMA has also argued that BATS has circumvented the process of receiving Commission approval and has been actively offering and marketing the BATS One Feed for months. The Commission notes, however, that the Exchanges have represented that, although they have been marketing the BATS One Feed, all of their marketing materials have included statements that the BATS One Feed's implementation was pending to Commission approval and at no point have the Exchanges offered the BATS One product for any use other than for testing and certification.

Description
       Bat Control SettingThe Yard Gard Ultrasonic Repeller is ideal for bat control.Dial the bat setting and plug it in. The ultrasonic sound environment is intolerable to bats.Bats are repelled away from the Yard Gard Ultrasonic Repeller because they cannot adapt to the constantly changing array of ultrasonic signals emitted by this device.         The #1 pest repeller on the market. Guaranteed to work or your money back!      -Create a protective barrier around your yard and home -High pitch sound waves that only pests can hear chase them away for good -Adjustable for different types of pests (bats, cats, deer, raccoons, skunks and more) -No chemicals or sprays. Just turn it on and let it work!     Don't mess with chemicals or messy sprays. We've experienced great results with this unit.Laboratory tests have proven this yard protector is highly effective for pest control. This electronic yard protector uses adjustable, powerful ultrasonic sound waves to repel bats, cats, deer, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, armadillos, skunks, bats, rodents and other creatures. The sound waves coming out of the unit create a very high pitch, high sound pressue environment that is incredibly uncomfortable and annoying to animals. The sound is inaudible to humans and can be tuned specifically for the type of animal you're trying to repel by adjusting the knob on the back of the unit. Set up is easy. Just plug the unit in or insert 4 "C" batteries (unit can only be run on motion sensing mode when running on batteries), point the unit so that it's coverage area is protecting the space you're trying to keep animals away from, set the knob to the approrpate animal or range of animals you're trying to repel and turn the unit on. The ultrasonic sound waves will immediately project out from the unit creating an invisible protection area where animals will have no desire to habitate. Humane and effective, ideal for yards, gardens, porches, buildings and greenhouses, for up to 4,000 square feet of coverage (oval pattern, 80 feet out from unit and 50 feet wide). Dual power-source capable (any standard 110 electrical plug or 4 "C" batteries). This unit is designed for outdoor use and has a waterproof casing. Try it for yourself. Discover the safer, easier way to handle your pest problems for good. And if you don't think it works, send it back. Your money will be cheerfully refunded. Features   Built-in motion sensor activates when animal moves into coverage zone (approx 35 ft.) Can be set to "always on" status and bypass motion sensor (only when plugged into 110 outlet) 30 ft extension cord plugs into standard 110vAC outlet Also uses 4 "C" batteries for use in areas where there is no 110vAC power Unit switches to battery power when there is a power failure Rugged ABS plastic design Easy to use control settings Waterproof: Includes plastic rain cover with mounting tab Environmentally safe Maintenance-free Laboratory tested Six month manufacturer warranty   Technical Specifications:   Dimensions: 6.75" x 5.25" x 3.5" Coverage: 4000 Square Feet Motion sensor range: 35 x 70 feet Frequency range: 15,000 - 25,000 Hz Sound Pressure: 90dB @ 3 ft UL/CUL, CE EPA listed
