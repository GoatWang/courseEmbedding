Dr. Robert T. Fraley







Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Dr. Robert Fraley is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Monsanto Company, where he leads a team of agricultural scientists dedicated to developing seeds and solutions that help farmers around the world yield a more abundant, affordable, and sustainable food supply. In this role, he oversees teams of researchers focused on plant breeding, plant biotechnology, ag biologicals, ag microbials, precision agriculture, and crop protection innovations that will help to feed our growing population.Robb’s interest in the intersection of technology and agriculture began at an early age while growing up on his family’s farm in central Illinois. Often recognized as the father of agricultural biotechnology, he developed the first genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the early 1980s as a solution for farmers battling pests and weeds that threatened their yields.During his 35-year tenure with Monsanto, Robb has held several leadership roles within the company, including Co-President of Monsanto’s agricultural sector, Group Vice President and General Manager of the New Products Division, Vice President of Technology for Crop Chemical and Plant Biotechnology R&D and Senior Research Specialist.A resident of St. Louis, Robb is involved in several local and international agriculture organizations. Fraley’s honors include World Food Prize Laureate (2013), National Medal of Technology from President Clinton (1998), National Academy of Sciences Award for the Industrial Application of Science for his work on crop improvement (2008), among others. Robb holds a Bachelor of Science and a Ph.D. in microbiology/biochemistry from the University of Illinois, an executive degree in business management from Northwestern University, and was a Biophysics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California – San Francisco.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
