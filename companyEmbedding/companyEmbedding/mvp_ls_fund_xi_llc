Mossberg® MVP LC Light-Chassis Bolt-Action Rifles







Medium fluted threaded bull barrel with muzzle brake

Magpul CTR adjustable stock

Tactical bolt handle and bipod

Mossberg's dependable MVP LC Light-Chassis Bolt-Action Rifles are sleek and powerful.

Medium bull fluted threaded barrel is outfitted with a muzzle brake to reduce muzzle jump. Mil-spec Magpul® MDT LSS lightweight aluminum chassis with Magpul CTR adjustable stock, MOE pistol grip and 10-round PMAG® magazine. Adjustable creep-free trigger from 2 to 7 lbs. Picatinny rail. Tactical bolt handle. External manual safety. Includes gun lock and bipod.

1. The performance reflects the asset charges for Series I shares from inception to January 27, 2002, and the asset charges for Series II shares for the time periods subsequent to January 27, 2002. The performance for Series II shares will be lower than Series I shares due to the higher Series II 12b-1 fee.


2. During the time period shown in the chart, the Lifestyles, Science & Technology, Blue Chip Growth, Equity-Income, Health Sciences and Small Company Value portfolios expenses were reimbursed. If such expenses had not been reimbursed, returns would be lower. Expense reimbursement for the International Core portfolio was terminated 11/25/02. Expense reimbursement for the Capital Appreciation portfolio was terminated effective 5/15/01.


3. The portfolios in the John Hanocck Variable Insurance Trust described above are not retail mutual funds and are only available under variable annuity contracts, variable life policies, or through participation in tax qualified retirement plans. Although the portfolios' investment adviser or subadvisers may manage retail mutual funds with similar names and investment objectives, no representation is made, and no assurance is given, that any portfolio's investment results will be comparable to the investment results of any other fund, including other funds with the same investment adviser or subadviser. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

How would you describe your past investing experiences?

If you answered "Frustrating," "disappointing" or "confusing," then you're certainly not alone. Perhaps the most common mistake investors make is to let emotions drive their investment decisions. So, how do you keep emotions in check and avoid making common investing mistakes? First, it makes sense to get assistance from a financial professional - someone who can help you develop strategies to meet your specific needs. In addition, research shows that strategies built upon the principles of asset allocation and diversification can help you reduce risk and earn more consistent performance over time.
As financial products become more complex, we offer a simple way to overcome the emotion of investing and help you pursue your investment objectives - the John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolios.

Discover the John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolios

Work with your financial professional today to evaluate your financial situation and goals. Your advisor can help you select the appropriate John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolio for your personal needs and risk tolerance.
Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protection against loss. Please note that asset allocation may not be appropriate for all investors, particularly those interested in directing the underlying funds on their own. A Lifestyle Portfolio is subject to the same risks as the underlying funds in which it invests, which include the following risks. Stocks and bonds can decline due to adverse issuer, market, regulatory or economic developments. Investing in foreign securities is subject to certain risks not associated with domestic investing such as currency fluctuations and changes in political and economic conditions. The securities of small capitalization companies are subject to higher volatility than larger, more established companies. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks, such as the increased risk of default. Before making an investment in a Lifestyle Portfolio, you should consider all the risks associated with it.Click here  to view the Lifestyle Portfolios Prospectus.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
