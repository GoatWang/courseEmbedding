Education and background[edit]
He spent most of his youth growing up in Los Angeles, California, New Orleans, Louisiana and St. Martinville, Louisiana. He graduated from St. Martinville Senior High School in 1985. Later that fall, he entered McNeese State University, Lake Charles, Louisiana. Over the next three and a half years, Charles studied design and advertising before receiving a BFA degree in 1989. After receiving his MFA degree in 1993 from the University of Houston, Houston, Texas, Charles began teaching at The University of Texas at Austin, Texas.

Work and research[edit]
Charles’s work and research is an investigation into the legacy of historic racial stereotypes of African Americans. His work examines how African Americans have been viewed in American history and also how they have come to view themselves as a result of demeaning stereotypes. In his colorful and graphic paintings and prints, Charles employs Black caricatures and stereotypes such as the Sambo, Aunt Jemima, grinning pickaninnies, and Uncle Tom, to comment on contemporary racial attitudes. His paintings have a scraped and antique look to resemble peeling vintage commercial art. With these he presents his own satirical campaign for a fictitious product called Forever Free. This product symbolizes the false promises of freedom made to African Americans by America and particularly also by the consumer market through their false images.[1] To show connections between the past and the present, Charles takes common Black stereotypical characters and reinterprets them in contemporary ways. For example, the image of Aunt Jemima, a mammy, is one caricature that Charles often critiques in his work. The mammy character has historically been the caring house servant for the White family. However, in a painting where Charles parodies Norman Rockwell’s Rosie the Riveter, the Aunt Jemima is portrayed as kind of heroine. She sits royally to suggest her unacknowledged contributions to White and Black America (a portrayal that would have never been in advertising at the time). At the same time, his ironic portrayals of the mammy are harsh critiques of her inferiority in commercial popular art. Charles sees the crafted image of mammies, along with other black characters, as an attempt to make them unthreatening to Whites.[2] The same kind of approach can be seen in the way Charles treats images of the Blackface characters and minstrel shows. Charles appears to believe that by confronting racist and demeaning imagery, one can expose today’s enduring subtle racist stereotypes.[1]
Public reception[edit]
Charles’ aggressive use of racial stereotypes has often been at the center of controversy. In a 1999 ARTnews article, Charles once explained, "Every time I have a show there are some black folks complaining." [3] However, his blunt approach to his artwork suggests that he wants to elicit strong emotions from viewers. While many have criticized him for this, some have applauded Charles for his daring questioning. For example, director Spike Lee has spoken of the artist’s work as “cinematic". "His works are one-sheets, posters for movies that Hollywood would never have the nerve to make, exploring race and sex in this country.” [4]
Career and achievements[edit]
Charles is amongst the first group of artists showcased in the 2001, PBS series titled "Art:21." The watershed series highlights top artists of the 21st century. A 2003 article in Black Issues In Higher Education acknowledges Charles as one of the top future African-American scholars under forty. In 2000, he was a consultant on Spike Lee's film, "Bamboozled" and has been the subject of several film documentaries.
He has served as a panelist for National Endowment for the Arts and jurors for The Bush Artist Fellowship, St. Paul, Minnesota. and the Inaugural Biennial Underground Railroad Exhibition, Northern Kentucky University, Kentucky.
Most recently, his work was included in the 2006 documentary "Race is the Place" and exhibitions at Cotthem Gallery, Barcelona, Spain and the PMMK Museum of Modern Art, Ostend, Belgium.
He lectures and exhibits nationally and internationally, and his work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in New York City, Germany, Paris, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Miami, and Santa Fe. His work is documented in many books, magazines and news papers as well as an extensive number public and private collection around the world including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, San Antonio Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, and the Austin Museum of Art.
Today, Charles continues to exhibit in national and international venues. His work remains the subject of books, magazines, and newspaper articles and is included in many public and private collection. Currently, Charles is a Professor of Art in the department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin. He and his family reside in Austin, Texas.
In 2014 Charles was appointed the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of Painting in the School of Art at the University of Houston.[5]

In his colorful and graphic paintings and prints, Charles employs Black caricatures and stereotypes such as the Sambo, Aunt Jemima, grinning pickaninnies, and Uncle Tom, to comment on contemporary racial attitudes. His paintings have a scraped and antique look to resemble peeling vintage commercial art. With these he presents his own satirical campaign for a fictitious product called Forever Free. This product symbolizes the false promises of freedom made to African Americans by America and particularly also by the consumer market through their false images.[1] To show connections between the past and the present, Charles takes common Black stereotypical characters and reinterprets them in contemporary ways. For example, the image of Aunt Jemima, a mammy, is one caricature that Charles often critiques in his work. The mammy character has historically been the caring house servant for the White family. However, in a painting where Charles parodies Norman Rockwell’s Rosie the Riveter, the Aunt Jemima is portrayed as kind of heroine. She sits royally to suggest her unacknowledged contributions to White and Black America (a portrayal that would have never been in advertising at the time). At the same time, his ironic portrayals of the mammy are harsh critiques of her inferiority in commercial popular art. Charles sees the crafted image of mammies, along with other black characters, as an attempt to make them unthreatening to Whites.[2] The same kind of approach can be seen in the way Charles treats images of the Blackface characters and minstrel shows. Charles appears to believe that by confronting racist and demeaning imagery, one can expose today’s enduring subtle racist stereotypes.[1]
Public reception[edit]
Charles’ aggressive use of racial stereotypes has often been at the center of controversy. In a 1999 ARTnews article, Charles once explained, "Every time I have a show there are some black folks complaining." [3] However, his blunt approach to his artwork suggests that he wants to elicit strong emotions from viewers. While many have criticized him for this, some have applauded Charles for his daring questioning. For example, director Spike Lee has spoken of the artist’s work as “cinematic". "His works are one-sheets, posters for movies that Hollywood would never have the nerve to make, exploring race and sex in this country.” [4]
Career and achievements[edit]
Charles is amongst the first group of artists showcased in the 2001, PBS series titled "Art:21." The watershed series highlights top artists of the 21st century. A 2003 article in Black Issues In Higher Education acknowledges Charles as one of the top future African-American scholars under forty. In 2000, he was a consultant on Spike Lee's film, "Bamboozled" and has been the subject of several film documentaries.
He has served as a panelist for National Endowment for the Arts and jurors for The Bush Artist Fellowship, St. Paul, Minnesota. and the Inaugural Biennial Underground Railroad Exhibition, Northern Kentucky University, Kentucky.
Most recently, his work was included in the 2006 documentary "Race is the Place" and exhibitions at Cotthem Gallery, Barcelona, Spain and the PMMK Museum of Modern Art, Ostend, Belgium.
He lectures and exhibits nationally and internationally, and his work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in New York City, Germany, Paris, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Miami, and Santa Fe. His work is documented in many books, magazines and news papers as well as an extensive number public and private collection around the world including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, San Antonio Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, and the Austin Museum of Art.
Today, Charles continues to exhibit in national and international venues. His work remains the subject of books, magazines, and newspaper articles and is included in many public and private collection. Currently, Charles is a Professor of Art in the department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin. He and his family reside in Austin, Texas.
In 2014 Charles was appointed the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of Painting in the School of Art at the University of Houston.[5]

Michael Ray Charles: When Racist Art Was Commercial Art


By: Steven Heller | January 16, 2012















In 1998 I published an article in Print about the artist, satirist and social critic Michael Ray Charles. It is appropriate that on this anniversary of Martin Luther King The Daily Heller republishes Charles’ words on how degrading stereotypes and negative racist imagery have impacted the American consciousness and conscience. And how as an African American he has co-opted and reclaimed caricatures that were an integral piece of American visual culture. 
“What if the Jews never talked about the Holocaust?” writes Michael Ray Charles in the introduction to his catalog of paintings, Michael Ray Charles: An American Artist’s Work (The Art Museum of the University of Houston). This rhetorical question underscores an artistic exploration that delves deep into the history of commercial art stereotypes, which during the late 19th and early 20th centuries relegated African Americans to graphic ghettos comprised of Sambos, mammies, minstrels, and coons. Charles argues that the once ubiquitous existence of these characters are virtually unknown to blacks. He believes that graphic depictions of infantile, shiftless, and baffoonish black men and women are artifacts that shed needed light on the conflict the black people have in society today. As both a reminder and as a way to co-opt these negative portrayals, Charles, 31 years old, a painter and professor at the The University of Texas at Austin, recasts ugly stereotypes in huge, satiric paintings that challenge the language of institutional racism.
The messages he conveys through his art, however, are not always welcome. “A lot of Blacks don’t want to see images like mine; perhaps they bring up too much pain,” asserts Charles. “A lot of whites are embarrassed and feel ashamed by them.  But out of sight, out of mind doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. It happened, and I feel it has not been dealt with.”
Charles is a strictly representational painter whose early work addressed political and social issues with homage to such 19th century commentators as Goya and Daumier, but without their rapier wit. However, with his most recent paintings of racial stereotypes found in vintage commercial art — which he began painting in 1993 and continue through his most recent exhibition at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York — he uses wit and irony to attack both the racism of the past and present. His paintings are rendered in a primative style and he quotes vintage circus banners, vernacular signs, and folk paintings, a pastiche that underscores the fact that these disturbing images were once was America’s most popular art.
Critics have attacked the artist for resurrecting images that were long ago hidden from view, ignored by historians as a sad chapter in the continuum of a burgeoning nation. But Charles argues that the issues raised by these images continue to haunt society albeit through different, contemporary stereotypes of ganstas, rappers, even characters on black-oriented TV sitcoms. Subjugation through imagery is something that is never totally expunged, and Charles wants to make certain that people understand the power that these had over peoples’ perceptions.
As a child Charles may have seen the remnants of vintage imagery that was still around his native Louisiana, but he did not think much of them — then. “When I was in graduate school, however, a colleague of mine gave me a little Sambo figurine,” he relates. “At the time I was doing paintings about the American flag so I didn’t use [these stereotypes] initially — I didn’t think it was what I was searching for. However, since I began to use such images, I feel I will never view life in the same way. ”
Through reprises of these dubious icons of “negro” America, Charles asserts that the roots of current stereotypes can be traced back to the history of disenfranchised blacks, but his art is also a form of self-exploration. “I want to know about these images — how they were used, why they were used, and when they are being used,” he says. “But there’s more to my work than just black face image or the clown caricature. I am deeply motivated by various forms of communication.” Common black stereotypes have changed from the poor shiftless, field-hand to mighty supermen atheletes earning million-dollar contracts and Charles’ visual archeology has helped him see how these vintage images are reconciled and revised. “I see images of the Black basketball player everywhere. I know it’s a hot fad, but I remember watching the Olympics when the first dream team was assembled, oh boy did America jump on the backs of those atheletes… But ultimately how does it effect the conditions of blacks,” he asks himself. And that is the rhetorical question present in all his work.
The mammy, particularly in the image of Aunt Jemima (who continues to grace the package of her namesake product) is one of the characters that Charles singles out for scrutiny. This is because in the history of stereotypes the desexualization of black people was deliberate, and the mammy — the caring, house servant who often raised the white man’s children — was the most desexualized of all. Charles portrays her in his work as kind of heroine. In a stunning parody of Norman Rockwell’s Rosie the Riveter, Aunt Jemima sits regally to suggest her unacknowledged contributions to white and black America (the Saturday Evening Post never showed a black woman in an heroic light, if at all). At the same time his ironic portrayals of mammy are harsh critiques of her diminuation in mainstream popular art. Charles regards the way that mammies and other black types were portrayed in art was a wanton attempt to make them unthreatening to whites. “I think they had to remain child-like, overweight, lazy, and unintelligent,” he explains.  “for whites to remind themselves of who they were.”
The minstrel show is another target. These musical entertainments, popular during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and comprised of whites putting on black face and cavorting on stage, were as well attended as the ethnic vaudeville shows. Minstrelry was the white’s attempt to mimmick and make fun of blacks, and a way of experiencing otherness at a safe distance. Some historians have argued that the essence of Black people was stolen. On the contrary, Charles insists that “it cannot be stolen. The essence of blackness, for me is defined as being able to withstand, to evolve, to grow inspite of, to show one’s wounds, to wear one’s scars, and get right back up because there is nothing else left to do. ”
One wonders how African American’s viewed themselves as a result of the national ad campaigns and comic sections that routinely used these stereotypes. Did the bombardment of these stereotypes have an indelible impact on self-esteem?. Charles believes that not only did the images influence blacks’ interpretations of themselves, “they continue to influence whites, Asian, European, African, and many other cultures’ perceptions of [American] Blacks and how they see themselves. These images are forever part of the vocabulary of what one should want and what one should not want. ”
Yet given Charles’ best intentions to educate blacks and whites through exposure to these images and his commentaries about them he says that he has received mixed responses. “One woman onced asked me ‘How does it feel to be the Clarence Thomas of the Art World?’” he relates. “She believed that Clarence Thomas was a sellout and by association, giving me the same title she said that I was selling out, too.. She had a very limited perspective. I am an individual who happens to be black. The fact that I am black does not mean that I represent, or support, every black cause.” In fact, she is not alone in feeling that introducing these images, which took many generations to forget, does more harm that good. “Her comments initially  bothered me,” continues Charles. “But ultimately I found it more humorous than anything. I don’t know, maybe she saw a part of herself in one of my paintings.” Nevertheless, Charles is disturbed that people cannot see the symbolic intent of his work, and only fixate on the surface meaning. “I had a journalist walk up to me and say, ‘So tell me about the Black woman in this painting.’ I responded by saying, that it’s not a Black woman; it’s an image that I use to refer to a Black woman. I don’t think she was able to separate the caricature image of a black person from the reality of knowing what a black person actually is.”
Through these paintings Charles is also attempting to understand when and if perceptions among whites towards blacks began to change for the better. “It’s evident that some white peoples’ perceptions about blacks have never changed,” he says about his conclusions. “This process of change has been a gradual thing that is consistently gaining and losing ground.”
One of the changes that have occured since the Black Power and Black is Beautiful consciousness raising days of the 1960s, is indeed the notions of ugliness and beauty. After one of Charles’ openings, a showing of paintings that included critiques of Little Black Sambo, the perennial children’s story (originally an East Indian folktale) of a little African boy’s travails with a tiger, he tells of an elderly white woman who came up to him and said, “‘Please don’t make the Sambo ugly; I love little Sambo. I grew up with the Sambo; it’s so dear to me.’” As she started to cry, Charles was struck by how much she had invested in a the fictional character. “She went on to say that she’s not racist,” Charles continues. “That her children grew up around black people, they had black people over all the time, and she worked in a school in which she taught black students She began making a cradling gesture as if she was holding a little baby.” But Charles concluded that “she didn’t get it.” She did not see his painted interpretation of Sambo as anything but a black person, rather than a representation of attitudes. “That instance is one of the things that really motivates me to continue my exploration into these images and how they effect us. ”
Michael Ray Charles’ paintings are tours de force that are formalist masterworks and discomforting messages. He understands the difficult line he’s toeing by reprising such charged images. Yet he insists that they deserve a certain respect that comes from more scrutiny. “I think about so many people whose lives these images have affected. A lot of Black people have died and many are dying under the weight of these images. That’s motivation enough for me to explore, and deal with, these things.”

It’s one thing to talk about the Holocaust, and not forget about injustice that happend in the past.
But that is not the same as bringing back old images that are degrading. Why re create offensive caricatyres and nuture those stupid images on peoples mind. I don’t see the meaning of that. When jewish people let the whole world not forget about the racism that they met, the Holocoust – they does not use old stupid negativ images of themself when they talk about what happend. Not like this without any context. It’s very contaproductive and opposite of going forward to something new. I think Bill Cosby brought more change with the Cosby show to white peoples mind than someone bringing up all those negative images. It’ s very hard to understand the point.

Once accused of being a racist (A WHITE WHO DOES NOT EMBRACE HIS OWN GENOCIDE) always a racist.  Once accused  of being a racist by an anti-white white or anti-white non-white always a racist.  Once accused of being a racist by a pro-white genodicidal maniac always a racist.  What is an evil WHITE  to do?
Africa for Africans, Asia for Asians, White Countries for Everybody 
Annihilation by Assimilation  Every white country on earth is supposed to become multicultural and  multiracial. EVERY white country is expected to end its own race and end  its own culture. No one asks that of ANY non-white country.  The Netherlands is more crowded than Japan, Belgium is more crowded than  Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve the RACE problem by  bringing in millions of third-worlders and assimilating and  intermarrying with them.  Everybody says the final solution to the RACE problem is for EVERY white  country and ONLY white countries to bring in the third world and  assimilate with them.
Immigration, tolerance, and especially assimilation are being used against the white race.  All this immigration and intermarriage is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries.  Anti-white is called anti-racist, but it leads to the disappearance of one race and only one race, the white race.
It is genocide.

Anti-whites never miss an opportunity to talk about how “racist” White people are.
White people can never disprove they are “racist”, no matter what they do it is seen as a form of “racism” by the so-called “anti-racists”.
Who are they kidding? Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.

How to identify if a commenter is anti-White and is inciting White genocide:1) They deny there is such a thing as White people or White countries.2) They scream about how evil White people are.3) They justify White genocide using one of a thousand different reasons.4) They wish for White genocide/celebrate it.5) They say any White who objects to points 1,2,3,4 are naziswhowanttokillsixmillionjews and should not be allowed to speak.

This is not a forum for racism of any kind. The comments above appear to be rooted in a white supremacist philosophy, which is decidedly wrong-headed, and obviously so to any reader of Imprint.

The R-WORD has been a principal tool anti-Whites have used to further their program of White Genocide. It carries the fundamental lie that racial feeling is a learned pathology rather than an innate biological trait that evolved to protect the survival of racial groups.
The R-WORD was developed by Trotsky as a way to dehumanize MILLIONS of White Christians mass-murdered in the Bolshevik Revolution for simply being White and Christian.
﻿The R-WORD is an attack word used by anti-Whites against White People and ONLY White People to facilitate the program of White geNOcide-by-assimilation via mass third world immigration and FORCED integration and “assimilation” in ALL and ONLY White countries. Anti-racism is a code word for anti-White.

Nobody is flooding and forcibly “integrating” every black nations and ONLY black nations with non-blacks and calling native blacks evil racists for opposing their replacement. This is happening in white nations and ONLY in white nations. Its genocide. They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.

Education and background[edit]
He spent most of his youth growing up in Los Angeles, California, New Orleans, Louisiana and St. Martinville, Louisiana. He graduated from St. Martinville Senior High School in 1985. Later that fall, he entered McNeese State University, Lake Charles, Louisiana. Over the next three and a half years, Charles studied design and advertising before receiving a BFA degree in 1989. After receiving his MFA degree in 1993 from the University of Houston, Houston, Texas, Charles began teaching at The University of Texas at Austin, Texas.




Michael Ray Charles, "(Forever Free) ‘Servin with a smile’," 1994


Work and research[edit]
Charles’s work and research is an investigation into the legacy of historic racial stereotypes of African Americans. His work examines how African Americans have been viewed in American history and also how they have come to view themselves as a result of demeaning stereotypes. In his colorful and graphic paintings and prints, Charles employs Black caricatures and stereotypes such as the Sambo, Aunt Jemima, grinning pickaninnies, and Uncle Tom, to comment on contemporary racial attitudes. His paintings have a scraped and antique look to resemble peeling vintage commercial art. With these he presents his own satirical campaign for a fictitious product called Forever Free. This product symbolizes the false promises of freedom made to African Americans by America and particularly also by the consumer market through their false images.[1] To show connections between the past and the present, Charles takes common Black stereotypical characters and reinterprets them in contemporary ways. For example, the image of Aunt Jemima, a mammy, is one caricature that Charles often critiques in his work. The mammy character has historically been the caring house servant for the White family. However, in a painting where Charles parodies Norman Rockwell’s Rosie the Riveter, the Aunt Jemima is portrayed as kind of heroine. She sits royally to suggest her unacknowledged contributions to White and Black America (a portrayal that would have never been in advertising at the time). At the same time, his ironic portrayals of the mammy are harsh critiques of her inferiority in commercial popular art. Charles sees the crafted image of mammies, along with other black characters, as an attempt to make them unthreatening to Whites.[2] The same kind of approach can be seen in the way Charles treats images of the Blackface characters and minstrel shows. Charles appears to believe that by confronting racist and demeaning imagery, one can expose today’s enduring subtle racist stereotypes.[1]
Public reception[edit]
Charles’ aggressive use of racial stereotypes has often been at the center of controversy. In a 1999 ARTnews article, Charles once explained, "Every time I have a show there are some black folks complaining." [3] However, his blunt approach to his artwork suggests that he wants to elicit strong emotions from viewers. While many have criticized him for this, some have applauded Charles for his daring questioning. For example, director Spike Lee has spoken of the artist’s work as “cinematic". "His works are one-sheets, posters for movies that Hollywood would never have the nerve to make, exploring race and sex in this country.” [4]
Career and achievements[edit]
Charles is amongst the first group of artists showcased in the 2001, PBS series titled "Art:21." The watershed series highlights top artists of the 21st century. A 2003 article in Black Issues In Higher Education acknowledges Charles as one of the top future African-American scholars under forty. In 2000, he was a consultant on Spike Lee's film, "Bamboozled" and has been the subject of several film documentaries.
He has served as a panelist for National Endowment for the Arts and jurors for The Bush Artist Fellowship, St. Paul, Minnesota. and the Inaugural Biennial Underground Railroad Exhibition, Northern Kentucky University, Kentucky.
Most recently, his work was included in the 2006 documentary "Race is the Place" and exhibitions at Cotthem Gallery, Barcelona, Spain and the PMMK Museum of Modern Art, Ostend, Belgium.
He lectures and exhibits nationally and internationally, and his work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in New York City, Germany, Paris, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Miami, and Santa Fe. His work is documented in many books, magazines and news papers as well as an extensive number public and private collection around the world including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, San Antonio Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, and the Austin Museum of Art.
Today, Charles continues to exhibit in national and international venues. His work remains the subject of books, magazines, and newspaper articles and is included in many public and private collection. Currently, Charles is a Professor of Art in the department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin. He and his family reside in Austin, Texas.
In 2014 Charles was appointed the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of Painting in the School of Art at the University of Houston.[5]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Michael Owens
ARTIST  FOR FREEDOM


 

 













Michael Ray Charles and Me 
By Michael Owens on October 16, 2013 in Art History, Inspiration, Politics 

Michael Ray Charles and Me
Mr. Charles
Michael Ray Charles is an artist I have admired for years and is without a doubt my favorite living artist. His work is very controversial due to his honest treatment of racial issues and his confrontational style. I was introduced to his work by one of my art school professors, Charles’ name was on a list of contemporary artists the class was assigned to research in order to “broaden our horizons”.  As soon as I saw his paintings I knew some version of that was what I wanted to do.
Charles’ colorful, graphically styled paintings draw upon the rich vein of historical racial stereotyping running through American advertising, product packaging, billboards, radio jingles, and television commercials. Charles relates the Little Black Sambo, Mammy, and minstrel images of a bygone era to contemporary mass-media portrayals of black youths, celebrities, and athletes. Charles feels such imagery is deeply ingrained in the American subconscious.  I for one, agree.
Circus
“Stereotypes have evolved,” he notes. “I’m trying to deal with present and past stereotypes in the context of today’s society.” Twisted caricatures of African-American experience, such as Aunt Jemima, are represented in Charles’s work as ordinary depictions of blackness, yet are stripped of the aura of harmlessness that lends them an appearance of truth that is very seldom questioned. People just don’t stop to think about where these images come from.
Charles says, “Aunt Jemima is just an image, but it almost automatically becomes a real person for many people, in their minds. But there’s a difference between these images and real humans.” In each of his paintings, notions of beauty, ugliness, nostalgia, and violence emerge and converge, reminding us that we can’t easily divorce ourselves from a past that has led us to where we are, who we have become, and how we are portrayed.
His work furthermore examines how African Americans have been viewed in American history and also how we have come to view ourselves as a result of demeaning stereotypes.
His paintings have a scraped, antique look to resemble peeling vintage commercial art. With these he presents his own satirical campaign for a fictitious product called Forever Free. This product symbolizes the false promises of freedom made to blacks by America and also by the consumer market through their false images.
Beware
Charles’ forceful and aggressive use of racial stereotypes has often been at the center of controversy. In a 1999 ARTnews  article, Charles explained, “Every time I have a show there are some black folks complaining.”  Obviously his blunt approach to his artwork tells us he wants to draw strong reactions from you and me, the viewer.  While he’s been criticized for daring to take this approach, some have applauded Charles for boldly questioning the status quo. For example, director Spike Lee has described Charles’ work as “cinematic. His works are one-sheets, posters for movies that Hollywood would never have the nerve to make, exploring race and sex in this country.”

 Michael Ray Charles (review)
      
      

R. Kumasi Hampton


From:  
          Nka: Journal of Contemporary African ArtNumber 10, Spring/Summer 1999

          p. 72
        



In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:
REVIEW M I C H A E L RAY C H A R L E S Contemporary Art Center Cincinnati, Ohio Somewhere between t h e colorful, violent turf of the Dennis Rodman persona and t h e neo-slapstick Fox Network sitcom, In Living Color, lies t h e ironic sensibility and of the exhibition, "Michael Ray Charles: An American Artist, 19891997 " shown last year at t h e Contemporary A r t Center (CAC) in Cincinnati. The bruising visual discourse presented by Charles explores t h e often inponderable i s sues and questions of our culture that circulate around racial stereotypes . With his neo-expressionist manner of painting and verbal m a nipulation Charles constantly reinvents and reconfigures negative advertising stereotypes of African American characters and destroys their original debasement . His well painted scandalous broadsides are staged in a vibrant and sardonic visual language which challenges the viewer. Charles's disturbing manipulations of racial images and stereotypes, follows in t h e manner of 1997's U.S. representative to the Venice Biennale, Robert Colescott. For much of his career, Colescott has unstintingly appropriated icons of t h e Western canon and turned them on their head. And like Colescottand Kara Walker, Charles revels in t h e explosive, intercultural subtext of identity and negative stereotypes, interracial sex and race-based icons. I t is Charles's interrogation and subversion of sambos, mammies and sports/celebrity icons which move these paintings thematic thrust onto theirtroubling turf. The format Charles employs is that of an enlarged advertising banner in which a retinue of Little black Sambos, aunt J e m i m a s , pickaninnies, negro court jesters, celebrities, sports icons and black face circus animals in harlequin pants make their stage appearances . Thus, Charles's antiquesurfaced advertising "explosions" and ragged-edge graphic takeoffs are elements of his fictitious and parodic product line(s) and merchandising campaign(s): "Forever SluePerioc/,1995, from t h e series, " T h e Liberty media o n paper, courtesy of the artist. Free", "The Liberty Brothers Permanent Daily Circus" and "The Forever Free Post". Within these three artistic series Charles e m ploys a brutal parody t o d e c o n struct negative, y e t once popular, malicious American concepts used to represent t h e many ideas once originally expounded in t h e nineteenth century doctrine of Negrophobia. However, t h e c o m plexity of t h e subject Charles e x plores leads one t o ask whether his idea of transgression is a t h o r oughly worked out critique of t h e stereotype or whether it is second generation appropriation whose use value is premised on its ordinary shock value and lack of critical dimension. Whatever one Brothers Permanently Daily Circus," mixed makes of these works, it is disturbing in a way that should lead to sober evaluation of its merits rather t h a n , as many who have chosen t o castigate t h e artist do, simply dismiss i t . These alarming works go deep into neglected emotional sites where phobias reside. Michael Ray Charles's works tour these obscure locations of personal and collective memory, seeking t o unravel their incipient power and connection t o an ever present American neurosis. I n t h e paintings, we are confronted with images of such v i olence emblematic of t h e fear we all feel when recalling t h e damage inflicted by these appropriated signifiers in t h e former context. We are confronted with this again and again in t h e multi-layered visual and discursive assaults in works from t h e "Liberty Brothers Permanent Daily Circus" series. Handi the Smart Asses \s a circus ring takeoff, of a tuxedoed ringleader commanding three dancing white horses. The Greatest Blow On Earth, plays havoc with the popular promotional theme of the Barnum and Bailey circus, with a large open-mouthed negro gaping t o receive cunnilingus or perform felatio. An Army of Clowns, presents an army of exquisitely colored dancing negro clowns surging to t h e foreground. White Girl TV Dinners...

His graphically styled paintings investigate racial stereotypes drawn from a history of American advertising, product packaging, billboards, radio jingles, and television commercials.

Biography
Michael Ray Charles is a contemporary American painter. His work explores historic African American stereotypes from the Antebellum South, appropriating images from advertising and pop culture to expose the underlying racism prevalent in contemporary culture. Charles creates a mimetic vocabulary of cultural, racial, and historicized images to subvert those themes and explore surviving caricatures that continue to appear in popular media, such as Aunt Jemima or Sambo. “Stereotypes have evolved. I’m trying to deal with present and past stereotypes in the context of today’s society,” the artist has said. Born in Lafayette, LA in 1967, he went on to earn his BFA from McNeese State University and his MFA from the University of Houston. His work has been both critically celebrated and the source of controversy, and in 2001 Charles was the subject of an Art:21 short documentary. He was appointed as the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of Painting in 2014 at the University of Houston's School of Art, and he has exhibited internationally, notably in the Austin Museum of Art, the Knox Art Gallery, and The Museum of Modern Art in New York.
