Heating & Cooling Contractors Furnace repair is a nuisance, and it always seems to occur in the middle of a bitterly cold winter. So you can't let furnace repair go for very long without fixing it, unless you like runny noses and hacking coughs. Except heating systems can be an easier fix than you may at first imagine. Sometimes a circuit breaker has simply tripped or a fuse has blown. If this is not the case though, you may have a blown pilot light. Though the fix may still be simple, it would be a good idea to hire a trained professional in furnace repair to address major problems in order to be safe rather than sorry. Need a new heating product for your home? Find price comparisons from various stores selling Heaters, Water Heaters and Space Heaters. HVAC Can Raise Your Comfort Level They may not be glamorous, but there's little doubt that the components that make up the HVAC system (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) are some of the most critical features of your home. Installed and maintained properly, these systems have a major impact on your comfort and health. When considering a new home or renovation of an old one, it's worth taking the time and investing the money to select the right systems to guarantee a long, comfortable life span for you and your home in . Our contractors can help you decide which HVAC system and brand is right for you: Trane, Carrier, Goodman, Amana, or Bryant. When you sit down with your contractor, be sure to consider the environment into which the HVAC system will be placed.

Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII) is an intercontinental company. Through its subsidiaries, it is a provider of climate control products for the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration markets around the world. The Company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads. He designed and patented a riveted steel coal-fired furnace, which led to numerous advancements in heating, cooling and climate control solutions. The company was sold in 1904 to DW Norris who managed the company until his death in 1949, following which ownership devolved to his descendants who continued to hold a prominent position in the company in the following decades.[1][2][3]
Today the company is focused on three core businesses: Residential Heating and Cooling, Commercial Heating and Cooling, and Refrigeration. The company headquarters are in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas.
In 1971 the small, nonprofitable (low pressure) gas cylinder business of Lennox Industries was sold to Worthington Industries, marking its first diversification step.[4][5][6]

Heating & Cooling Contractors Furnace repair is a nuisance, and it always seems to occur in the middle of a bitterly cold winter. So you can't let furnace repair go for very long without fixing it, unless you like runny noses and hacking coughs. Except heating systems can be an easier fix than you may at first imagine. Sometimes a circuit breaker has simply tripped or a fuse has blown. If this is not the case though, you may have a blown pilot light. Though the fix may still be simple, it would be a good idea to hire a trained professional in furnace repair to address major problems in order to be safe rather than sorry.

HVAC Can Raise Your Comfort Level They may not be glamorous, but there's little doubt that the components that make up the HVAC system (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) are some of the most critical features of your home. Installed and maintained properly, these systems have a major impact on your comfort and health. When considering a new home or renovation of an old one, it's worth taking the time and investing the money to select the right systems to guarantee a long, comfortable life span for you and your home in . Our contractors can help you decide which HVAC system and brand is right for you: Trane, Carrier, Goodman, Amana, or Bryant. When you sit down with your contractor, be sure to consider the environment into which the HVAC system will be placed.

Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII) is an intercontinental company. Through its subsidiaries, it is a provider of climate control products for the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration markets around the world. The Company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads. He designed and patented a riveted steel coal-fired furnace, which led to numerous advancements in heating, cooling and climate control solutions. The company was sold in 1904 to DW Norris who managed the company until his death in 1949, following which ownership devolved to his descendants who continued to hold a prominent position in the company in the following decades.[1][2][3]
Today the company is focused on three core businesses: Residential Heating and Cooling, Commercial Heating and Cooling, and Refrigeration. The company headquarters are in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas.
In 1971 the small, nonprofitable (low pressure) gas cylinder business of Lennox Industries was sold to Worthington Industries, marking its first diversification step.[4][5][6]

Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII) is an intercontinental company. Through its subsidiaries, it is a provider of climate control products for the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration markets around the world. The Company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads. He designed and patented a riveted steel coal-fired furnace, which led to numerous advancements in heating, cooling and climate control solutions. The company was sold in 1904 to DW Norris who managed the company until his death in 1949, following which ownership devolved to his descendants who continued to hold a prominent position in the company in the following decades.[1][2][3]
Today the company is focused on three core businesses: Residential Heating and Cooling, Commercial Heating and Cooling, and Refrigeration. The company headquarters are in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas.
In 1971 the small, nonprofitable (low pressure) gas cylinder business of Lennox Industries was sold to Worthington Industries, marking its first diversification step.[4][5][6]

Be smart when watering your lawn this summer. Water in the AM and PM when temps are cooler and less water will evaporate before soaking in.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
