The   development is also the latest to be completed in the Administration’s   efforts to rebuild the blighted South Bronx. The Mayor was joined at the   announcement by Jonathan Rose Companies President Jonathan F. P.

The slowdown in economic growth is not   indicative of a significant deterioration in the underlying strength of   economic activity, but a fading inventory boost to GDP growth.
