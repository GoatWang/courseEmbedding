History[edit]
Westinghouse Air Brake Company was founded in 1869. Part of that company was acquired by American Standard in 1968 and were designated as American Standards' Vehicle Control Systems division. American Standard changed its name to Trane, Inc. and on July 31, 2007, Trane spun off its Vehicle Control Systems as WABCO Holdings, Inc via a special dividend to its shareholders. The owners of Trane, Inc. stock received one share of WABCO Holdings for every three shares of Trane, Inc which they held.[3]
Trane, Inc. was acquired by Ingersoll-Rand the following year.[4]
Notable products[edit]
WABCO Holdings' key product groups are brake actuators, air compressor/air management, foundation brake, anti-lock braking, conventional braking, electronic braking, air suspension, transmission automation, vehicle electronic architecture, and stability control/support.[5] [6]
Markets[edit]
Major customers for WABCO Holdings are commercial and consumer vehicle OEMs and commercial after-market parts suppliers. Commercial truck and bus OEMs - such as Daimler (largest customer; 13% of sales, 2010), Cummins, Paccar, and Volvo - account for the majority of sales (62% of sales, 2013). Commercial after-market suppliers represent a significant minority of sales (25% of sales, 2013). Trailer and consumer vehicle OEMs also contribute a small percentage of sales.[7][8]
WABCO Holdings primary market is in Europe (61% of sales, 2013). They get some business from Asia/Pacific region, and much less from other regions of the world.[9]
North America Vehicle Control System and some compressor sales and support is provided by a Joint Venture (JV) with Meritor Inc. (Formerly Rockwell Automotive) while Disc Brake sales and higher margin compressor sales are handled directly by offices in Rochester Hills, MI and Charleston, SC.
North American operations also has a division "WABCO Reman Solutions" formed to offer remanufacturing of various brands of defective automotive components as well as WABCO branded defective components.

History[edit]
Westinghouse Air Brake Company was founded in 1869. Part of that company was acquired by American Standard in 1968 and were designated as American Standards' Vehicle Control Systems division. American Standard changed its name to Trane, Inc. and on July 31, 2007, Trane spun off its Vehicle Control Systems as WABCO Holdings, Inc via a special dividend to its shareholders. The owners of Trane, Inc. stock received one share of WABCO Holdings for every three shares of Trane, Inc which they held.[3]
Trane, Inc. was acquired by Ingersoll-Rand the following year.[4]
Notable products[edit]
WABCO Holdings' key product groups are brake actuators, air compressor/air management, foundation brake, anti-lock braking, conventional braking, electronic braking, air suspension, transmission automation, vehicle electronic architecture, and stability control/support.[5] [6]
Markets[edit]
Major customers for WABCO Holdings are commercial and consumer vehicle OEMs and commercial after-market parts suppliers. Commercial truck and bus OEMs - such as Daimler (largest customer; 13% of sales, 2010), Cummins, Paccar, and Volvo - account for the majority of sales (62% of sales, 2013). Commercial after-market suppliers represent a significant minority of sales (25% of sales, 2013). Trailer and consumer vehicle OEMs also contribute a small percentage of sales.[7][8]
WABCO Holdings primary market is in Europe (61% of sales, 2013). They get some business from Asia/Pacific region, and much less from other regions of the world.[9]
North America Vehicle Control System and some compressor sales and support is provided by a Joint Venture (JV) with Meritor Inc. (Formerly Rockwell Automotive) while Disc Brake sales and higher margin compressor sales are handled directly by offices in Rochester Hills, MI and Charleston, SC.
North American operations also has a division "WABCO Reman Solutions" formed to offer remanufacturing of various brands of defective automotive components as well as WABCO branded defective components.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
