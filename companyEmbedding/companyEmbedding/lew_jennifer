Artist Overlay Cover Image

 
                      (.jpeg, .gif, or .png, must be 1920px x 420px)
                    

                      This photo will appear at the top of your artist
                      overlay, which appears when customers click on your
                      name. Please upload a "cover photo" that reveals your
                      workplace, tools, or a detail or pattern from your work.
                      We'll apply a transparent overlay on top of your image
                      to ensure legibility of your hand-written name and
                      artist information.
                    





Hand-written Name: Black


 
                        (Upload a transparent .png that's 415px x 120px)
                      


                      Please upload a hand-written image of your full name (first and
                      last) on a 100% transparent background. This image will
                      appear on
                      your category page and on the
                      certificate of authenticity for art prints. Your
                      hand-written name will express your identity as an
                      artist and should not use fonts or logos, but can
                      definitely incorporate whimsy.
                      See here for more information on
                      preparing the file and view some examples.
                    





Hand-written Name: White


 
                        (Upload a transparent .png that's 600px x 160px)
                      


                      Please upload a second, white version of your hand-written name.
                      The background should be 100% transparent.
                      See here for more information on
                      preparing the file.
                    





Category Page Image

 
                        (.jpeg, .gif, or .png, must be 450px x 210px)
                      


                      This photo will appear at the top of the category page
                      when customers search for you on the site. Please upload
                      a photograph of yourself, not a logo.
                    






Thank You Note

                    Please write a short note to customers who purchase your
                    designs. This note will be displayed to customers after
                    purchase and inserted into their shipping box, adding a
                    special personal touch that helps customers remember you.
                    Please do not include your contact info or a URL. This
                    information could create confusion for follow-up customer
                    service.
                  
You have fabulous taste. Thank you!

               Company: Papyrus
Job Details
               The word PAPYRUS (pah:pie:rus) comes from the earliest form of paper crafted from the PAPYRUS plant. PAPYRUS was founded in the family kitchen of Marcel and Margrit Schurman in 1950. Inspired by a love of fine art, they had a vision for products of uncompromising quality which provided the starting point from which genuine personal connections are made. They presented their products in an inviting gallery setting to encourage engagement with the products and with a friendly and helpful staff. 56 years, and over 165 stores later, PAPYRUS is the destination for celebrating life and all of its moments.  Under the leadership of Marcel's and Margrit's daughter, Dominique Schurman, PAPYRUS is charting a future shaped by modern, relevant and elegant design. In stores nationwide, PAPYRUS offers an ever expanding array of products including custom printed announcements, products for entertaining, greeting cards, gift wrap, gift bags, stationery, note cards, journals, and unique gift products. Papyrus produces a diverse selection of quality greeting cards and paper products. Much of the artwork featured on our products is purchased from freelance artists, and ranges from graphics, traditional, whimsical, humor and contemporary pieces to photography. We are always searching for additional freelance artists whose art will enhance the quality of our products, and welcome the opportunity to review your submissions. Please do not send final artwork for unsolicited consideration. Slides or printed pieces are preferred, although we will consider good color copies and color photographs. As color is one of the main criteria by which we judge your work, make sure that the samples you send represent your actual color style as closely as possible. For photography, send duplicate slides or color prints. Please submit no more than 12 pieces of your work, preferably in a neat notebook format. When we review the samples, we look for concept, style, drawing skill and color usage. In addition to greeting cards, Papyrus also produces a variety of other items from original art including gift wrap, gift bags, gift boxes, journals and stationery. Our standard counter card size is 5" x 7" single-fold. Vertical orientation is preferred. We also produce more elaborate cards, so let us know if you have ideas for die-cut, multi-panel, pop-up or other premium card designs. If you have experience designing repeats for gift wrap (or textiles), please include any printed pieces, roughs or color copies of those designs. In general, we do not publish fantasy, erotic or occult illustrations. Papyrus buys exclusive world rights to reproduce artwork as greeting cards, packaged cards, stationery, gift bags, gift boxes, gift wrap and a variety of other products. Advances, royalties and flat fees are relative to the type of product being produced. Original artwork is returned to (and remains the property of) the artist.
