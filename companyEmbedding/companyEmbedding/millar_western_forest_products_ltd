About Millar Western
Millar Western is a privately held Alberta-based forest products company that has been in business for more than a century. We apply that experience in developing renewable resources safely and responsibly, while holding to our core values of safety, integrity, honesty, trust and respect.
Founded by J.W. Millar in the early 1900s, Millar Western established its forestry operations in Alberta in the 1920s. The company was owned and operated by the Millar family for over a century. In 2017, Atlas Holdings acquired a majority position in the company, with the Millar family maintaining 20% ownership.
We are headquartered in Edmonton and produce pulp and lumber at manufacturing facilities in Whitecourt and Fox Creek. We employ  550 employees full-time, and hundreds more on a contract basis, in forest management and mill operations.  Our people enjoy stable and rewarding careers in a safe and respectful work environment.
We source all our timber from sustainably managed forests in Alberta, in close proximity to our mills. To ensure renewal of healthy, diverse forests, we plant two to three seedlings for every coniferous tree we cut and reforest deciduous trees through natural regeneration. In addition to complying with stringent laws governing forest management, we are certified to the SFI sustainable forest management standard and the PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody standards.
At our manufacturing facilities, we employ advanced environmental controls to minimize our footprint. Committed to continuous improvement, we have implemented innovative projects to reduce water intake, cut energy consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Our new bioenergy project will soon convert organics in our pulp mill effluent into green energy, to further improve our performance.
Our roots lie in our communities, and our investments are local — but our reach is global. Millar Western lumber is destined for North American and Asian markets, while our pulp is shipped to papermakers around the world, primarily in Asia and Europe. With access to modern and efficient transportation systems, we offer reliable and cost-effective product delivery to customers.
Collaborative, progressive and responsible – we are a resourceful company. We are Millar Western.

Products HomeProducts


Millar Western has earned a reputation for producing top quality lumber and pulp products made from timber harvested from Alberta’s sustainably managed forests.
The preferred choice of North America’s construction industry, spruce-pine-fir (SPF) lumber is used in a variety of applications, including residential and commercial construction, fencing and decking. Millar Western lumber trades in North America primarily through wholesale distributors and overseas through a marketing consortium, Interex Forest Products Ltd. The majority of lumber is sold within Canada, with the balance shipped to Asia and the U.S. Sales inquiries can be directed to our Lumber Sales Department.
In contrast to traditional pulping processes that use strong chemicals to break wood chips down to individual fibres, bleached chemi-thermo-mechanical pulp (BCTMP), or high yield pulp, is made by combining heat, mild chemicals and mechanical action to generate a pulp with significant functional and environmental advantages. BCTMP is desirable for characteristics such as bulk, stiffness and opacity, which makes it suitable for a wide range of paper products, such as fine printing and writing paper, paperboard, specialty papers, tissue and toweling. Most Millar Western pulp is sold into Asia and Europe, with a smaller proportion shipped to destinations in the Americas. Sales inquiries can be directed to our Pulp Marketing Department.

Pulp HomeProductsPulp


Millar Western is a pioneer in the development of high-yield pulps: we introduced papermakers to hardwood grades made from aspen and were instrumental in expanding the use of softwood and blended grades in a range of new applications. Valued for their bulk, stiffness and opacity, our pulps are highly suitable for use in products such as fine printing and writing papers, paperboard, specialty papers, tissue and toweling.
We produce more than 20 grades of pulp, to meet a variety of end-use requirements. In addition to grade flexibility, we offer technical expertise that comes with over 25 years of experience in delivering high-quality pulp products to customers around the world. Our mills and sales teams work closely with production teams, to maximize the performance of our grades in papermakers’ products.
Our advanced pulp production facility is located in Whitecourt, Alberta, which has access to a modern and efficient transportation system. Millar Western works to build long-term relationships with its logistics partners, to offer reliable and cost-effective delivery of our pulps to international papermakers.


Millar Western high-yield pulps are an environmentally responsible choice:

Compared to conventional pulp processes, our manufacturing method produces up to twice as much pulp per tree and consumes less water.
Our Whitecourt facility uses the latest in environmental control technology, resulting in an excellent record of regulatory compliance. Our BOD, COD and TSS levels* – all measurements of the quality of the effluent we discharge to receiving waters – are well within government limits.


We use hydrogen peroxide as a bleaching agent, making our process totally chlorine free.
The pulp mill has made significant strides in refining its processes to reduce our environmental footprint: water consumption has fallen 21% since 2002 and electricity usage has dropped 19% since 2008.
Our pulp has been tested as safe for use in the manufacture of papers and boards for food packaging; it contains no anthroquinone.

Customers can be assured that the fibre used to make Millar Western pulp is legally sourced from forests managed with care. Our softwood grades are made with spruce-pine-fir (SPF) wood chips from our adjacent sawmill, while our hardwood grades are made from aspen, an abundant, fast-growing tree species. The timber used to produce Millar Western pulp is harvested exclusively in Alberta, Canada, from natural forests within 175 kilometres of our mill. The vast majority is obtained from government-owned land, which is managed in strict compliance with federal and provincial laws and regulations. In renewing healthy forests, we plant only indigenous species, from seeds collected within harvested areas.
Millar Western wood products, including pulp, are made using only local, indigenous tree species harvested within 175 km of our mills:  Trempling aspen (Populus tremuloides), Balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), White spruce (Picea glauca), Black spruce (Picea mariana), Balsam fir (Abies Balsamea)
As further evidence of our commitment to responsible, sustainable forest management, we are certified to the SFI sustainable forest management certification (Certificate #PRI-SFI-047) and also hold PEFC (Certificate #2599.02) and FSC (Certificate #KF-CoC-001021) chain-of-custody certifications. Our pulp is compliant with the requirements of the European Timber Regulation and the U.S. Lacey Act.  It has also been added to Nordic Ecolabelling’s list of inspected pulps, for its compliance to the following modules:

Nordic Ecolabelling of Paper Products – Basic Module
Nordic Ecolabelling of Paper Products – Chemical Module 

*BOD – Biological oxygen demand. COD – chemical oxygen demand, measures organic compounds in water. TSS – total suspended solids, particles that are larger than 2 microns in water.

Lumber HomeProductsLumber


Millar Western has been in operation for over a century and producing lumber since the 1920s.  Throughout our long history, we have established a reputation for quality, reliability and integrity.
Spruce, pine, fir (SPF) dimension lumber is used in a variety of applications, including residential and commercial construction, fencing and decking.
Our state-of-the-art sawmills in Whitecourt and Fox Creek, Alberta, produce 450 million board feet of kiln-dried spruce-pine-fir (SPF) lumber, in dimensions ranging from 1×3″ to 2×10″, and in lengths from 6′ to 16′.   We also manufacture machine-stress-rated (MSR) lumber for engineered roofing and load-bearing applications, 5/4″ lumber and timbers for decking material, a high-quality J-Grade that would meet or surpass the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS), and other specialty wood products.
Millar Western SPF lumber provides strength, stability and flexibility, making it the preferred choice of builders the world over.


Each piece of Millar Western lumber is marked with a grade stamp indicating its quality and intended use.  We grade our lumber according to demanding standards set by the Canadian Lumber Standards Accreditation Board (CLS) and the North American Lumber Grading Association (NLGA).  The Alberta Forest Products Association regularly inspects our grading practices to ensure they comply with the requirements of these agencies.


Grade-stamped Millar Western lumber


The timber used to make our lumber is harvested exclusively in Alberta, Canada, mostly from government-owned forests that, according to law, must be managed in a sustainable manner.  The forests in which we operate are certified to the SFI® standards for sustainable forest management and fibre sourcing.  Our lumber has also earned certification under the PEFC™ chain-of-custody program, assuring customers of the legality of our timber procurement practices.
Wood building materials are good for the environment:   they are renewable, biodegradable and recyclable, and they store carbon, resulting in a smaller environmental footprint than other building materials.
The majority of our lumber products is shipped within Canada and to the U.S., but a growing proportion is destined for Asian markets.  Our mills have access to sophisticated and dependable intermodal transportation networks to assure timely delivery to customers everywhere.
A trusted name in forest products, Millar Western is ready and available to discuss your lumber needs.  North American sales inquiries can be directed to our Edmonton office:  mwfp@millarwestern.com.  Overseas buyers may contact our exclusive international sales and marketing representative, Interex Forest Products Ltd.:  info@interexfp.com.

("Millar Western" or the "Company") today announced a proposed exchange transaction (the "Note Exchange Transaction") in respect of the Company's US$210 million aggregate principal amount of 8.5% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Existing Notes") that would significantly reduce the Company's indebtedness, deleverage its capital structure and strengthen its financial position, thereby creating added stability for the Company and enhancing the Company's ability to respond to and capitalize on developments in the forest products industry.Certain funds affiliated with Atlas Holdings LLC (collectively, "Atlas"), which beneficially own approximately 36% of the Existing Notes, have signed a support agreement with the Company (the "Support Agreement") pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to support the Note Exchange Transaction and to vote in favour of a plan of arrangement (the "Plan of Arrangement") implementing the Note Exchange Transaction under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the "CBCA") at a meeting of holders of Existing Notes (the "Noteholders") scheduled for April 11, 2017 (the "Meeting").The Note Exchange Transaction has the following key elements:the exchange of all of the Existing Notes for new U.S. dollar 9.0% senior secured notes due 2022 to be issued by the Company (the "New Secured Notes") in an aggregate principal amount equal to 50% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes plus New Secured Notes equal to an additional 5% of the principal amount of Existing Notes held by Noteholders on the voting record date who vote in favour of the Plan of Arrangement on or before March 31, 2017 (the "Early Consent Notes"); the New Secured Notes will be secured on a first lien basis by substantially all of the assets and property of the Company, subject to the existing first lien security over the Company's accounts receivable and inventory (the "Priority Collateral") granted by the Company to its bank lender (the "Bank Lender"); the Note Exchange Transaction will reduce the principal amount of the Company's indebtedness by approximately US$97 million, reduce its annual cash interest costs by more than US$7 million and provide an extended maturity date for the New Secured Notes; it is a condition to implementation of the Note Exchange Transaction that Atlas will agree to exchange approximately US$41.7 million of principal amount of New Secured Notes it receives pursuant to the Note Exchange Transaction for 80% of the outstanding shares of the Company (the "Share Exchange Transaction"), further reducing the Company's annual cash interest costs by approximately an additional US$3.75 million, and enhancing the position and credit quality of the remaining New Secured Notes. Upon the completion of the Share Exchange Transaction, the principal amount of New Secured Notes outstanding will be approximately US$71 million; if approved, the Plan of Arrangement will bind all Noteholders; and obligations to employees, customers, suppliers and governmental entities will not be affected by the Note Exchange Transaction and will continue to be satisfied in the ordinary course.The actual amount of debt and cash interest reductions following the Note Exchange Transaction and Share Exchange Transaction will depend on how many Noteholders receive Early Consent Notes.The Note Exchange Transaction will be implemented by way of the Plan of Arrangement and is expected to be completed by April 28, 2017.  Earlier today, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "Court") issued an interim order authorizing, among other things, the holding of the Meeting, the mailing of information packages to Noteholders, the procedure for submitting voting instructions in respect of the Plan of Arrangement, eligibility requirements to receive Early Consent Notes, and certain other procedural matters.The record date for determining the Noteholders entitled to vote on the Plan of Arrangement is March 8, 2017 at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time).  Mailing of the information packages with respect to the Meeting, which include an information circular and instructions for voting on the Plan of Arrangement, will commence on March 13, 2017 and such information packages will be available on EDGAR (www.sec.gov).In connection with the transactions described above, the Company has entered into a consent acknowledgment (the "Consent Acknowledgment") with the Bank Lender pursuant to which the Bank Lender has consented to, and waived any default under, the Company's credit agreement in respect of the Note Exchange Transaction and the Share Exchange Transaction, and the Company has agreed to grant the Bank Lender a second-lien security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets and property other than the Priority Collateral as well as certain amendments to the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants.  The Consent Acknowledgment is conditional on the execution of definitive documentation.MPA Morrison Park Advisors Inc. has provided an opinion to the Company's board of directors (the "Board of Directors") that, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications contained therein, the Plan of Arrangement, if completed, is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company.  The Board of Directors, after careful consideration of various factors and alternatives and consultations with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, and having received the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors, has determined that the Note Exchange Transaction offers substantial benefits to Millar Western and is in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders, and all of the directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors unanimously determined to recommend to Noteholders that they vote in favour of the Plan of Arrangement at the Meeting."We are pleased with the outcome of our review of potential alternatives to improve the Company's capital structure and the proposed Note Exchange Transaction announced today," said J. Craig Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer. "With a delevered capital structure and a strong equity partner in Atlas, the Company will be well-positioned to continue to pursue our business strategy going forward and be able to capitalize on developments in the forest products industry."Read MoreThe Board of Directors recommends that all Noteholders vote in favour of the Plan of Arrangement at the Meeting.Completion of the Note Exchange Transaction will be subject to, among other things, approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the affirmative vote of at least 66⅔% of the votes cast by Noteholders present in person or by proxy at the Meeting, approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the Court, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions.  If all requisite approvals are obtained, the Plan of Arrangement will bind all Noteholders.Noteholders with questions about the Note Exchange Transaction, eligibility to receive Early Consent Notes or voting at the Meeting are encouraged to contact Kingsdale Advisors, the Company's solicitation, information and exchange agent, at 1-866-581-0512 toll-free in North America or call collect at 1-416-867-2272 outside of North America or by email at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.The Support Agreement and a draft of the indenture that will govern the New Secured Notes will be filed by the Company on EDGAR (www.sec.gov).Millar Western's legal advisors in connection with the Note Exchange Transaction are Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Goodmans LLP and its financial advisor is Perella Weinberg Partners LP.This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the New Secured Notes in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.  The New Secured Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act") and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.The Company will release today its annual report (Form 20-F), including audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The financial results will be made available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR website.  About Millar WesternMillar Western is an integrated forest products company based in Alberta, Canada that produces and markets hardwood and softwood bleached chemi-thermo-mechanical pulp, or BCTMP, and softwood lumber. Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release may include information that are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of securities laws.  These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include words such as "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "intend", "plan", "likely", "will", "predicts", "estimates", "forecasts" or other similar words or phrases.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
