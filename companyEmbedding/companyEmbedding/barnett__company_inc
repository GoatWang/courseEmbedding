    Customer Testimonials





Customer Testimonials


"We really do appreciate the service we get from Barnett. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Our shipments always arrive when expected. We choose Barnett because they have the best prices around. They are our #1 supplier."


                Philip Horton
                CJ's Plumbing Inc.
                Winnsboro, TX
            












"I would like to thank Barnett for their fast and friendly service. I owe most of my success with my plumbing company to you! There is no better company to work with; I have not found any supplier like Barnett. Also, my Barnett sales representative has gone far beyond my expectations and we've developed a solid relationship. Thanks Barnett for a good seven years of service and counting!" 


                Andrew McInerney 
                Andrew's PlumbCrazy Plumbing 
                Lake Havasu City, AZ
            






"We love the prices and service we receive from Barnett. Not only are the product prices very affordable, but because we are located in a rural area, having BIG CITY service delivered right to our doorstep saves us tons of money! You also can't beat their knowledgeable and courteous staff."


                Krisha Fleming
                Holey Plumbing
                Lindale, Texas
            













"As a seller of Premier brand faucets, we have received nothing less than long-term, satisfied customers. Premier brand faucets show superior quality and craftsmanship in every product made. The Premier faucet line has been a top seller and a customer favorite. Customer reviews on our Web site prove that Premier brand faucets provide exceptional products at great prices."


                Robert Surowiec and Marc Wukczewski
                R & M Plumbing Design
            






"Like many other contractors, our inventory situation was getting out of control. Since we implemented Barnett's Vendor Managed Inventory program, we have been able to focus on servicing our customers rather than spending our time dealing with all of our many inventory issues. This is an ongoing project for us and our relationship with Barnett has been open and honest. Barnett has worked well with us and they have met our goals and timetables. Barnett can even source our regional item needs. The fact that we can purchase our HVAC equipment from a single source has helped us get to where we need to be."


                Phil Frasier
                Frasier's Plumbing 
                and Heating
                Rhinelander, WI
            












"Nusbaum Electric, Inc. has been doing business with Barnett for over eight years now. We have always been pleased with the customer service supplied by Barnett. We focus on installing quality products for our customers—using Barnett as our supplier ensures that we can accomplish this task." 


                Mike Nusbaum 
                Nusbaum Electric, Inc. 
                Londonderry, NH
            




"When I moved my business from Illinois to Alabama, Barnett moved with me. Never a hassle, Barnett offers the best sales and service anyone can ask for. With great prices, a full line of products, and free shipping on orders over $850, they simply can't be beat. Whether your business is big or small, Barnett will be there every step of the way. Thanks Barnett!"

BARNETT'S FASTEST BOW. EVER.
Ghost 420


As if sending arrows flying at 420 FPS isn't enough, the Ghost 420 looks as good as it performs. It's the first product to debut Mossy Oak Treestand® Monochromatic: a sleek, deluxe camo pattern exclusive to this crossbow.

PERFORMANCE COMES NATURALLY.
Buck Commander Revengeance


Everything about the Buck Commander® Revengeance should be too good to be true. It's an easy-cocking, fast-shooting crossbow with crazy speed in a compact, manageable reverse draw design that just feels natural in your hands.

BLAZE YOUR OWN TRAIL.
Recruit Terrain


#GetOutThere and tackle any terrain with the Recruit Terrain. This is the only crossbow in Barnett's line of full-size models featuring a solid desert tan stock. It doesn't have a pattern like other crossbows, because it isn't for just any other hunter.

FIT FOR THE HUNT.
Whitetail Hunter Pro


Barnett engineers have worked tirelessly to design a stock that hits the sweet spot of compactness for full-framed shooters, and they've done it with the Whitetail Hunter Pro. This is how a compound crossbow should feel: comfortable, sturdy and unobtrusive.

Barnett





The Barnett brand’s primary customers are professional plumbing, electrical, HVAC and building contractors. Barnett functions as a wholesaler with a cost structure similar to that of a manufacturer because of its ability to import high-quality products at very low cost. Barnett sells major brand names, but also offers its own private label alternatives at lower prices, providing the contractor with higher profits. The catalog shows net contractor prices, which eliminates list price/multiplier calculations and is easier for the customer to understand. Supported by monthly sale flyers and promotions, Barnett sells through direct-mail marketing, telesales, online at www.e-barnett.com, local pickup counters and field sales reps in major markets.
