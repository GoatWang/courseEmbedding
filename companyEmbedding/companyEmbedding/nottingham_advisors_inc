The ETF-Advantage | Nottingham Advisors

FL 800-281-8974



























						The ETF-Advantage					





Nottingham’s philosophy centers on the construction of portfolios through the use of exchange-traded funds. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities designed to track the performance of a particular market index. ETFs provide purity of style, liquidity, transparency, and diversification in a cost conscious way. Nottingham believes this approach offers a unique solution that separates the firm approach from individual security selection as well as the traditional “manager of managers” model.

Select Managers Program | Nottingham Advisors

FL 800-281-8974



























						Select Managers Program					






The Nottingham Advisors Select Managers Program (NASMP) employs a unique approach to asset allocation, utilizing actively managed mutual funds. The program brings together “best in class” managers across market capitalization, style, sector, industry, country and region. The NASMP offers strategies ranging from conservative to aggressive in both tax sensitive and non-tax sensitive models.
We believe an investors asset allocation is a function of four main factors: risk tolerance, expected return, time horizon, and portfolio objective.
Click each portfolio strategy to learn more.







Risk Tolerance


Time Horizon


Expected Return


Objective


Income


Balanced


All-Asset


Growth


Aggressive Growth







Click below to learn more





										          Risk Tolerance										        




How much volatility are you as an investor willing to withstand? This becomes a very important component of investing when liquidity mandates are set. 







										          Time Horizon										        




How long do you plan to be investing? This could be a defined year in the future or a significant life event (wedding, retirement). For institutional clients Time Horizon can be infinite. 







										          Expected Return										        




Return generally increases as risk increases, the basics of the Risk-Return tradeoff. 







										          Objective										        




Investment Objectives are strategies that an investor is willing to undertake to pursue their specific investment goals.







										          Income										        




The NASMP Income strategy seeks current income in the context of capital preservation.







										          Balanced										        




The NASMP  Balanced strategy seeks current income in the context of capital preservation, with secondary consideration given to growth of capital.







										          All-Asset										        




The NASMP All-Asset strategy seeks to balance growth of capital with current income.







										          Growth										        




The NASMP Growth strategy seeks growth of capital, with secondary consideration given to current income.







										          Aggressive Growth										        




The NASMP Aggressive Growth strategy seeks growth of capital.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
