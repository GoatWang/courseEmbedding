Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Avon Products (NYSE:AVP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months.

Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $5.90 (61.64% upside)

Aqua Metals Company Profile
Aqua Metals, Inc. is engaged in the business of recycling lead through a process that the Company developed and named AquaRefining. The Company’s AquaRefining process focuses on providing for the recycling of lead acid batteries (LABs) and the production of lead. AquaRefining uses bio-degradable aqueous solvent and an ambient temperature electro-chemical process to produce lead. The modular nature of AquaRefining makes it possible to start LAB recycling at a much smaller scale than is possible with smelters. Its AquaRefining process begins with the crushing of used LABs and the separation of the metallic lead, active material (lead compounds), sulfuric acid and plastic for recycling. The active material is dissolved in its solvent. The primary lead is then stripped from the solvent using its automated process allowing the solvent to be reused continuously and indefinitely. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not generated revenues.
Global Brass and Copper Holdings Company Profile
Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. is a converter, fabricator, processor and distributor of specialized non-ferrous products, including a range of sheet, strip, foil, rod, tube and fabricated metal component products. The Company operates through three segments: Olin Brass, Chase Brass and A.J. Oster. Its Olin Brass segment is engaged in manufacturing, fabricating and converting specialized copper and brass sheet, strip, foil, tube and fabricated products. The Chase Brass segment is engaged in manufacturing brass rod, including round, hexagonal and other shapes. The A.J. Oster segment is engaged in processing and distributing copper and copper-alloy sheet, strip and foil, operating six service centers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Its products are used in a range of applications across markets, including the building and housing, munitions, automotive, transportation, coinage, industrial machinery and equipment, and general consumer end markets.

What are analysts saying about Costamare stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Costamare stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Costamare Inc. operates as a containership owner chartering its vessels to liner companies. The Company deploys its containership fleet principally under multi-year time charters with leading liner companies that operate regularly scheduled routes between large commercial ports. It also provides a range of shipping services, such as technical support and maintenance, insurance consulting, financial and accounting services. Costamare Inc. is headquartered in Athens, Greece.   " (7/3/2017)
2. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We are upgrading CMRE to Outperform (from Market Perform) as we believe its risk-reward profile is skewed to the positive, with CMRE well positioned for valuation uplift from the Container market trough, in our view. CMRE is off 63% (vs. the S&P 500 up 0.2%) over the past 18 months as the stock has faced significant downward pressure from liquidity risk, rechartering risk, counterparty risk, a dividend cut, and a soft rechartering outlook amid the containership trough. Given that significant equity downside (to 0.4x NAV), we believe CMRE is an attractive container recovery play, while we also believe the severity of its headwinds should gradually ease over time, with CMRE making a number of recent moves to reposition its intermediate-term liquidity and stabilize its balance sheet. While we remain broadly cautious around global containerized trade, we think Street expectations have generally fallen to match that outlook, with the risk/reward associated with a bottoming outlook potentially skewed to the upside, at least longer-term. We effectively think CMRE has most of its bad news priced into it at this point, and while continued pressure within its peer group or a more substantive outline for a border tax regime still linger as potential headwinds (particularly the latter), we think the longer-term recover potential outweighs them, and we reiterate our Outperform rating with a valuation range of $8-9/share."
