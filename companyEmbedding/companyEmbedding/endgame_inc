History[edit]
Endgame was started in 2008 by Chris Rouland and other executives who previously worked with the CIA and ISS. In October 2010 it saw an investment of 29 million USD, raised from Bessemer Ventures, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), and TechOperators.[8] The company offers commercial web-based malware detection services, defensive digital security intelligence and big data analysis software.[9][10][11][12]
In February 2011, the company announced partnerships with HP[13] and IBM to use Endgame's IP Reputation Intelligence service within HP's TippingPoint Digital Vaccine service and IBM's managed services offerings. That same month emails sent to HB Gary from Endgame were leaked which revealed that the company sold zero-day vulnerabilities.[3] As of 2014 Endgame has moved away from zero-day exploitations to identifying and protecting consumers from potential cyber threats. Endgame now offers its services to companies within the financial services industry and consumer technology companies.[14] Through its software the company collects information from data sources accessed by consumers, identifying potential security threats.[15]
In December 2012, Endgame announced the appointment of Nathaniel Fick as Chief Executive Officer,[16] replacing Chris Rouland. A former Marine and author of bestseller One Bullet Away, Fick was previously CEO of the Center for a New American Security, an independent and nonpartisan national security and defense policy research institution, and remains an operating partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.[17]
In March 2013, Endgame closed a $23 million Series B equity financing with the stated purpose to fund growth in its existing federal customer base as well as expand into the commercial market. The round was led by new investor Paladin Capital Group,[18] a multi-stage private equity firm, and included participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and TechOperators.[19]
Endgame initially became known for providing cyber intelligence to US agencies such as the National Security Agency[15] but as of 2013 expanded to financial and commercial clients within the private sector, raising an additional $30 million in funding with investment from Edgemore Capital, Top Tier Capital Partners and Savano Capital Partners.[14][20] Endgame offers defensive analytics of a company's network and servers for data exploits.[14][21]
Endgame acquired Onyxware in 2014, a Florida-based mobile security technology company which provides applications for detecting third-party network threats.[22] As of November 2014 Endgame boasts approximately 100 employees.[14]
Leadership[edit]
The Endgame Board of Directors is led by Christopher Darby, President and CEO of In-Q-Tel, an independent strategic investment firm supporting the missions of the intelligence community. Endgame announced in March 2013 that Kenneth Minihan, former Director of the National Security Agency and Managing Director at Paladin, had also joined its Board of Directors. In April 2014 James N. Miller, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy was appointed to its board of advisers.[21] Niloofar Howe was appointed the chief strategy officer and Jamie Butler serves as its chief scientist.[11] Jon Brody is the senior vice president of marketing and Jim Tosh is the vice president of engineering.[12]

History[edit]
Endgame was started in 2008 by Chris Rouland and other executives who previously worked with the CIA and ISS. In October 2010 it saw an investment of 29 million USD, raised from Bessemer Ventures, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), and TechOperators.[8] The company offers commercial web-based malware detection services, defensive digital security intelligence and big data analysis software.[9][10][11][12]
In February 2011, the company announced partnerships with HP[13] and IBM to use Endgame's IP Reputation Intelligence service within HP's TippingPoint Digital Vaccine service and IBM's managed services offerings. That same month emails sent to HB Gary from Endgame were leaked which revealed that the company sold zero-day vulnerabilities.[3] As of 2014 Endgame has moved away from zero-day exploitations to identifying and protecting consumers from potential cyber threats. Endgame now offers its services to companies within the financial services industry and consumer technology companies.[14] Through its software the company collects information from data sources accessed by consumers, identifying potential security threats.[15]
In December 2012, Endgame announced the appointment of Nathaniel Fick as Chief Executive Officer,[16] replacing Chris Rouland. A former Marine and author of bestseller One Bullet Away, Fick was previously CEO of the Center for a New American Security, an independent and nonpartisan national security and defense policy research institution, and remains an operating partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.[17]
In March 2013, Endgame closed a $23 million Series B equity financing with the stated purpose to fund growth in its existing federal customer base as well as expand into the commercial market. The round was led by new investor Paladin Capital Group,[18] a multi-stage private equity firm, and included participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and TechOperators.[19]
Endgame initially became known for providing cyber intelligence to US agencies such as the National Security Agency[15] but as of 2013 expanded to financial and commercial clients within the private sector, raising an additional $30 million in funding with investment from Edgemore Capital, Top Tier Capital Partners and Savano Capital Partners.[14][20] Endgame offers defensive analytics of a company's network and servers for data exploits.[14][21]
Endgame acquired Onyxware in 2014, a Florida-based mobile security technology company which provides applications for detecting third-party network threats.[22] As of November 2014 Endgame boasts approximately 100 employees.[14]
Leadership[edit]
The Endgame Board of Directors is led by Christopher Darby, President and CEO of In-Q-Tel, an independent strategic investment firm supporting the missions of the intelligence community. Endgame announced in March 2013 that Kenneth Minihan, former Director of the National Security Agency and Managing Director at Paladin, had also joined its Board of Directors. In April 2014 James N. Miller, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy was appointed to its board of advisers.[21] Niloofar Howe was appointed the chief strategy officer and Jamie Butler serves as its chief scientist.[11] Jon Brody is the senior vice president of marketing and Jim Tosh is the vice president of engineering.[12]

Cybersecurity requires the brightest minds to tackle today's security challenges. So no matter who you are – academics, hackers, public servants, or industry gurus - if you are driven and willing to collaborate, we have a place for you.








InclusionCybersecurity requires the brightest minds to tackle today's security challenges. So no matter who you are – academics, hackers, public servants, or industry gurus - if you are driven and willing to collaborate, we have a place for you.










ImpactCybersecurity is among the toughest technological and national security challenges of our time. We combine science and technology to make life for the bad guys a little harder every day, all in an effort to make the aspiration of a safe and secure Internet a reality.




GrowthWe don’t view professional development as an added perk, but as a necessity. Staying ahead of the evolving threats requires a workforce who constantly strives to remain at the top of their field. We encourage employees to participate in the community through publications, conference attendance, and speaking opportunities.










FlexibilityWe don’t believe in punching time cards, but rather knocking out code and content during you and your team’s optimal work hours. We break traditional organizational stovepipes, and encourage collaboration within and across teams. This helps us foster those serendipitous encounters and open communication that builds a great team and promotes innovation.

“Enterprises can no longer sit back and wait for threat data to come to them. The next generation of security challenges requires a more proactive approach to detect and respond to threats that have evaded defensive technologies. I have found Endgame’s Hunt platform helpful in allowing an analyst to quickly detect never-before-visible malicious behaviors on host systems, and block and remove threats in real-time."  

— Ryan Gurr, Information Security Manager at NuScale Power
 

 


“Endgame’s platform elevates our tier 1 analysts to operate at a tier 3 level, allowing us to spend less time and resources on incident response and compromise assessment. With Endgame, we can prevent, detect, and proactively hunt advanced attacks at the earliest possible moment, before damage and loss of critical assets.”
— Dan Basile, Information Security Officer, Texas A&M
 

 


“ The rules of the game have changed.  Organizations are compromised and need to hunt for adversaries in their networks. Endgame’s approach to threat hunting will better equip organizations with the tools necessary to stop advanced adversaries at the earliest stages.” 
— Dr. Eric Cole, Secure Anchor Consulting, Former SANS Instructor

History[edit]
Endgame was started in 2008 by Chris Rouland and other executives who previously worked with the CIA and ISS. In October 2010 it saw an investment of 29 million USD, raised from Bessemer Ventures, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), and TechOperators.[8] The company offers commercial web-based malware detection services, defensive digital security intelligence and big data analysis software.[9][10][11][12]
In February 2011, the company announced partnerships with HP[13] and IBM to use Endgame's IP Reputation Intelligence service within HP's TippingPoint Digital Vaccine service and IBM's managed services offerings. That same month emails sent to HB Gary from Endgame were leaked which revealed that the company sold zero-day vulnerabilities.[3] As of 2014 Endgame has moved away from zero-day exploitations to identifying and protecting consumers from potential cyber threats. Endgame now offers its services to companies within the financial services industry and consumer technology companies.[14] Through its software the company collects information from data sources accessed by consumers, identifying potential security threats.[15]
In December 2012, Endgame announced the appointment of Nathaniel Fick as Chief Executive Officer,[16] replacing Chris Rouland. A former Marine and author of bestseller One Bullet Away, Fick was previously CEO of the Center for a New American Security, an independent and nonpartisan national security and defense policy research institution, and remains an operating partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.[17]
In March 2013, Endgame closed a $23 million Series B equity financing with the stated purpose to fund growth in its existing federal customer base as well as expand into the commercial market. The round was led by new investor Paladin Capital Group,[18] a multi-stage private equity firm, and included participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and TechOperators.[19]
Endgame initially became known for providing cyber intelligence to US agencies such as the National Security Agency[15] but as of 2013 expanded to financial and commercial clients within the private sector, raising an additional $30 million in funding with investment from Edgemore Capital, Top Tier Capital Partners and Savano Capital Partners.[14][20] Endgame offers defensive analytics of a company's network and servers for data exploits.[14][21]
Endgame acquired Onyxware in 2014, a Florida-based mobile security technology company which provides applications for detecting third-party network threats.[22] As of November 2014 Endgame boasts approximately 100 employees.[14]
Leadership[edit]
The Endgame Board of Directors is led by Christopher Darby, President and CEO of In-Q-Tel, an independent strategic investment firm supporting the missions of the intelligence community. Endgame announced in March 2013 that Kenneth Minihan, former Director of the National Security Agency and Managing Director at Paladin, had also joined its Board of Directors. In April 2014 James N. Miller, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy was appointed to its board of advisers.[21] Niloofar Howe was appointed the chief strategy officer and Jamie Butler serves as its chief scientist.[11] Jon Brody is the senior vice president of marketing and Jim Tosh is the vice president of engineering.[12]

  Blake Strom (MITRE),  Paul Ewing September 14, 2016
 
  
 After adversaries breach a system, they usually consider how they will maintain uninterrupted access through events such as system restarts. This uninterrupted access can be achieved through persistence methods. Adversaries are constantly rotating and innovating persistence techniques, enabling them to evade detection and maintain access for extended periods of time. A prime example is the recent DNC hack, where it was reported that the attackers leveraged very obscure persistence techniques for some time while they evaded detection and exfiltrated sensitive data.
The number of ways to persist code on a Windows system can be counted in the hundreds and the list is growing. The discovery of novel approaches to persist is not uncommon. Further, the mere presence of code in a persistence location is by no means an indicator of malicious behavior as there are an abundance of items, usually over a thousand, set to autostart under various conditions on a standard Windows system. This can make it particularly challenging for defenders to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activity.
With so many opportunities for adversaries to blend in, how should organizations approach detection of adversary persistence techniques? To address this question, Endgame is working with The MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit R&D organization, to demonstrate how the hunting paradigm fits within the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework. The ATT&CK™ framework—which stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge—is a model for describing the actions an adversary can take while operating within an enterprise network, categorizing actions into tactics, such as persistence, and techniques to achieve those tactics. Endgame has collaborated with MITRE to help extend the ATT&CK™ framework by adding a new technique – COM Object Hijacking – to the persistence tactic, sparking some great conversations and insights that we’ve pulled together into this post. Thanks to MITRE for working with Endgame and others in the community to help update the model, and a special thanks to Blake Strom for co-authoring this piece. Now let the hunt for persistence begin!
 
Hunting for Attacker Techniques
Hunting is not just the latest buzzword in security. It is a very effective process for detection as well as a state of mind. Defenders must assume breach and hunt within the environment continually as though an active intrusion is underway. Indicators of compromise (IOC) are not enough when adversaries can change tool indicators often. Defenders must hunt for never-before-seen artifacts by looking for commonly used adversary techniques and patterns. Given constantly changing infrastructure and the increasingly customized nature of attacks, hunting for attacker techniques greatly increases the likelihood of catching today’s sophisticated adversaries.
Persistence is one such tactic for which we can effectively hunt. Defenders understand that adversaries will try to persist and generally know the most common ways this can be done. Hunting in persistence locations for anomalies and outliers is a great way to find the adversary, but it isn’t always easy. Many techniques adversaries use resemble ways software legitimately behaves on a system. Adversary persistence behavior in a Windows environment could show up as installing seemingly benign software to run upon system boot, when a user logs into a system, or even more clever techniques such as utilizing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Smart adversaries know what is most common and will try to find poorly understood and obscure ways to persist during an intrusion in order to evade detection.
MITRE has provided the community with a cheat sheet of persistence mechanisms through ATT&CK™, which describes the universe of adversary techniques to help inform comprehensive coverage during hunt operations. It includes a wide variety of techniques ranging from simply using legitimate credentials to more advanced techniques like component firmware modification approaches. The goal of an advanced adversary is not just to persist - it is to persist without detection by evading common defensive mechanisms as well. These common evasion techniques are also covered by ATT&CK™. MITRE documented these techniques using in-depth knowledge about how adversaries can and do operate, like with COM hijacking for persistence.
To demonstrate the value of hunting for specific techniques, we focus on Component Object Model (COM) Hijacking, which can be used for persistence as well as defense evasion.
 
So What’s Up with the COM?
Microsoft’s Component Object Model (COM) has been around forever – well not exactly – but at least since 1993 with MS Windows 3.1. COM basically allows for the linking of software components. This is a great way for engineers to make components of their software accessible to other applications. The classic use case for COM is how Microsoft Office products link together. To learn more, Microsoft’s official documentation provides a great, comprehensive overview of COM.
Like many other capabilities attackers use, COM is not inherently malicious. However, there are ways it can be used by the adversary which are malicious. As we discussed earlier, most adversaries want to persist. Therefore, hunters should regularly look for signs of persistence, such as anomalous files which are set to execute automatically. Adversaries can cleverly manipulate the COM to execute their code, specifically by manipulating software classes in the current user registry hive, and enabling persistence.
But before we dive into the registry, let’s have a quick history lesson. Messing with the COM is not an unknown technique by any means. Even as early as 2005, adversaries were utilizing Internet Explorer to access the machine’s COM to cause crashes and other issues. Check out CVE-2005-1990 or some of CERT’s vulnerability notes discussing exactly this problem.
COM object hijacking first became mainstream in 2011 at the Virus Bulletin conference, when Jon Larimer presented “The Dangers of Per-User COM Objects.” Hijacking is a fairly common term in the infosec community, and describes the action of maliciously taking over an otherwise legitimate function at the target host: session hijacking, browser hijacking, and search-order hijacking to name a few. It didn’t take long for adversaries to start leveraging the research presented at Virus Bulletin 2011. For example, in 2012, the ZeroAcess rootkit started hijacking the COM, while in 2014 GDATA reported a new Remote Administration Tool (RAT) dubbed COMpfun which persists via a COM hijack. The following year, GDATA again presented the use of COM hijacking, with COMRAT seen persisting via a COM hijack. The Roaming Tiger Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group reportedly also used COM hijacking with the BBSRAT malware. These are just a few examples to demonstrate that COM hijacking is a real concern which hunters need to consider and handle while looking for active intrusions in the network.
 
The Challenges and Opportunities to Detect COM Hijacking
Today, COM hijacking remains relevant, but is often forgotten. We see it employed by persistent threats as well as included in crimeware. Fortunately, we have one advantage - the hijack is fairly straightforward to detect. To perform the hijack, the adversary relies on the operating system to load current user objects prior to the local machine objects in the COM. This is the fundamental principle to the hijack and also the method to detect.
Easy, right? Well, there are some gotchas to watch out for.  Most existing tools detect COM hijacking through signatures. A COM object is identified in the system by a globally unique identifier called a CLSID.  A signature-based approach will only look at and alert on specific CLSIDs which reference an object that has been previously reported as hijacked. This is nowhere near enough because, in theory, any COM object and any CLSID could be hijacked.
Second, for us hunters, the presence of a user COM object in general can be considered anomalous, but some third-party applications will generate such objects causing false positives in your hunt. To accurately find COM hijacks, a more in-depth inspection within the entire current user and local machine registry hive is necessary. In our single default Windows 7 VM, we had 4697 CLSIDs within the local machine hive. To perform the inspection, you will need to dust off your scripting skills and perform a comparative analysis within the registry. This could become difficult and may not scale if you are querying thousands of enterprise systems, which is why we baked this inspection into the Endgame platform.
 
So many objects to hijack...
At Endgame, we inspect the registry to hunt exactly for these artifacts across all objects within the registry and this investigation scales across an entire environment. This is critical because hunters need to perform their operations in a timely and efficient manner. Please reference the following video to see a simple COM hijack and automatic detection with the Endgame platform. Endgame enumerates all known persistence locations across a network, enriches the data, and performs a variety of analytics to highlight potentially malicious artifacts in seconds.  COM hijacking detection is one capability of many in the Endgame platform.

Conclusion
Persistence is a tactic used by a wide range of adversaries.  It is part of almost every compromise. The choice of persistence technique used by an adversary can be the most interesting and sophisticated aspect of an attack. This makes persistence, coupled with the usual defense evasion techniques, prime focus areas for hunting and subsequent discovery and remediation. Furthermore, we can’t always rely on indicators of compromise alone. Instead, defenders must seek out anomalies within the environment, either at the host or in the network, which can reveal the breadcrumbs to follow and find the breach.
Without a framework and intelligent automation, the hunt can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and unfocused. MITRE’s ATT&CK™ framework provides an abundance of techniques that can guide the hunt in a structured way. With this as a starting point, we have explored one persistence technique in depth: COM hijacking. COM hijacks can be detected without signatures through intelligent automation and false positive mitigation, getting beyond many challenges present if an analyst would need to find COM hijacks manually. This is just one way in which a technique-focused hunt mindset can allow defenders to detect, prevent, and remediate those adversaries that continue to evade even the most advanced defenses.

 Hunting for Exploit Kits 
  Joe Desimone September 28, 2016
 
  
 E-mail spam and browser exploitation are two very popular avenues used by criminals to compromise computers.  Most compromises result from human error, such as clicking a malicious link or downloading and opening an attachment within an email and enabling macros.  Email filtering can offer effective protections against the delivery of widespread malicious spam, and user training can be reasonably effective in reducing the number of employees willing to open an unknown document, enable macros, and self-infect.
Protection against browser exploitation is more difficult, which occurs simply by visiting a website.  Users are prone to clicking links to malicious sites, and much worse, criminals actively exploit well trafficked sites (directly through web server exploitation or indirectly via domain squatting, ad injections, or other techniques) and cause the user’s browser to covertly visit an exploit server. The user’s browser gets hit, a malicious payload such as ransomware is installed, and the user has a bad day.
The hardest part of this for attackers is the exploitation code itself.  Fortunately for criminals, a thriving underground market for exploit kits is available.  These occasionally contain zero days, but more often, exploit kit authors rapidly weaponize new vulnerabilities which will allow for exploitation of users who fail to rapidly patch their systems.  
Exploit kits are often key components of crimeware campaigns, which is estimated to be a $400 billion global market. Capturing these often evasive exploit kits is essential to advance research into protecting against them, but samples are hard to obtain for researchers. To solve this problem, we created Maxwell, an automated exploit kit collection and detection tool that crawls the web hunting for exploits. For researchers, Maxwell significantly decreases the time it takes to find exploit kits samples, and instead enables us to focus on the detection and prevention capabilities necessary to counter the growing criminal threat of exploit kits.
 
Exploit Kits in the Wild
The Angler exploit kit - responsible for a variety of malvertising and ransomware compromises - is indicative of just how lucrative these exploit kits can be. By some estimates, Angler was the most lucrative compromise platform for crimeware, reeling in $60 million annually in ransomware alone. Earlier this year, a Russian criminal group was arrested in connection with the Lurk Trojan. This coincided with an end of Angler exploit kit activity. A battle for market share has ensued since, with RIG and Neutrino EK jockeying for the market leading position.
A typical business model for exploit kit authors is malware as a service. The authors rent access to their exploit kits to other criminals for several thousand dollars a month, on average.
Other criminal groups instead opt to focus more on traffic distribution services or gates, and set out to compromise as many web servers as possible. Once compromised, they can insert iframe re-directions to websites of their choosing. The users of exploit kits can pay for this as a service to increase the amount of traffic their exploit kits receive and drive up infections.
 
The Exploitation Process
The graphic below depicts a high-level overview of the six core steps of the exploitation process. There are numerous existing case studies on exploit kits, such as one on Nuclear, that provide additional, very low level details on this process.
 

A user visits a legitimate web page.
Their browser is silently redirected to an exploit kit landing page. This stage varies, but focuses on traffic redirection. Either the attacker compromises the website and redirects the user by adding JavaScript or an iframe, or the attacker pays for an advertisement to perform the redirection.
The exploit kit sends a landing page which contains JavaScript to determine which browser, plugins and versions the user is running. Neutrino EK is a little different in that this logic is embedded in a Flash file that is initially sent.
If the user’s configuration matches a vulnerability to a particular exploit (e.g., an outdated Flash version), the user’s browser will be directed to load the exploit.
The exploit’s routines run, and gain code execution on the user’s machine.
The exploit downloads and executes the chosen malware payload. Today, this is usually ransomware, but it can also be banking trojans, click fraud, or other malware.
 
How to Catch an Exploit Kit: Introducing Maxwell
There are numerous motivations for collecting and analyzing exploit kits. As a blue teamer, you may want to test your defenses against the latest and greatest threat in the wild. As a red teamer, you may want to do adversary emulation with one of the big named exploit kits (e.g., Neutrino, RIG, Magnitude). Or maybe you have some other cool research initiative. How would you go about collecting new samples and tracking activity? If you work for a large enterprise or AV company,  it is relatively easy as your fellow employees or customers will provide all the samples you need.  You can simply set up packet collection and some exploit kit detections at your boundary and sit back and watch.  But what if you are a researcher, without access to that treasure trove of data? That’s where Maxwell comes in. Maxwell is an automated system for finding exploit kit activity on the internet. It crawls websites with an army of virtual machines to identify essential information, such as the responsible exploit kit, as well as related IPs and domains.
 
The Maxwell Architecture
Maxwell consists of a central server, which is basically the conductor or brains of the operation, connecting to a vSphere or other cloud architecture to spin up and down virtual machines. RabbitMQ and ElasticSearch provide the means for message queuing and indexing the malicious artifacts. The virtual machine consists of a variety of Python agent scripts to enable iterative development, as well as a pipe server that receives messages from the instrumentation library, filters those that match a whitelist, and forwards the remaining messages to a RabbitMQ server.
Flux is our instrumentation library, which is a DLL loaded to new processes with a simple AppInit DLL key. Flux hooks the usual functions for dropping files, creating registry keys, process creation, etc. The hooking is done only in user-mode at the Nt function level. The hooks must be at the lowest possible level in order to capture the most data. Flux also has some exploit detection capabilities built in, and shellcode capturing, which will be discussed shortly.
Moving to outside the virtual machine, the controller is a Python script that listens on a RabbitMQ channel for new jobs, including basic information like the website to visit, a uuid, and basic config information. Once a new job is received, the controller is responsible for spinning up a virtual machine and sending the job information and the plugin to execute (which is currently only Flux). The controller uses ssh to copy files into the virtual machine. The results server is also a Python script that listens on a different RMQ channel. This script receives data from the virtual machines during execution. The data is forwarded to an Elasticsearch index for permanent storage and querying. Once a job has completed, the results server determines if any malicious activity has occurred. If so, it executes post processing routines. Finally, all extracted data and signature information is sent in a notification to the researcher. An important design decision worth noting, is to stream events out of the virtual machine during execution, as opposed to all at once after a timeout. The latter is susceptible to losing information after ransomware wreaks havoc in the virtual machine.
When configuring your virtual machine, it’s important to make it an attractive target for attackers, who work by market share and target the most popular software, such as Windows 7, Internet Explorer, and Flash. Be sure to also remove vmtools and any drivers that get dropped by VMware. You can browse to the drivers folder and sort by publisher to find VMware drivers. Finally, you should consider patch levels, and pick plugin versions that are exploitable by all major exploit kits, while also disabling any additional protections, such as IE protected mode.
 
Exploit Detection in Maxwell
As mentioned earlier, Maxwell automates exploit detection. While previously ROP detection was reliable enough, it is no longer effective at detecting modern exploit kits. The same is true for stack pivot, which basically checks ESP to see if it points to the heap instead of the stack, and is easily evaded by Angler and other exploit kits.
In Flux, we throw guard pages not only on the export address table, but also the IAT and MZ header of critical modules. We also use a small whitelist instead of a blacklisting technique, enabling us to catch shellcode that is designed to evade EMET. Even better, we can detect memory disclosure routines that execute before the shellcode. When a guard page violation is hit, we also save the shellcode associated with it for later inspection.
Similar to all sandboxes, Flux can log when files are dropped, new processes are created, registry keys are written to, or even when certain files are accessed. File access can be used to detect JavaScript vm-detection routines before an exploit is even triggered. However, these are all too noisy on their own so we must rely heavily on the whitelist capability. Essentially, every typical file/registry/process action that is observed from browsing benign pages is filtered, leaving only malicious activity caused by the exploit kit. Even if they evade our exploit detection techniques, we will still detect malicious activity of the payload as it is dropped and executed.
If malicious activity is detected, the post-processing step is activated by executing tcpflow on the PCAP to extract all sessions and files. Next, regular expressions are searched across the GET/POST requests to identify traffic redirectors (such as EITEST), EK landing pages, and payload beacons. Finally, any dropped files, shellcode, and files extracted from the PCAP are scanned with Yara. The shellcode scanning allows for exploit kit tagging based on the specific shellcode routines used in each kit, which are very long lasting signatures.
If you are protecting a network with snort rules for a component of the EK process, you need to know when Maxwell stops flagging a signature. Building robust signatures limits the necessity to frequently update them. There are a few tricks for writing robust signatures, such as comparing samples over time to extract commonalities or creating signatures from Flash exploits themselves. Both of these may result in longer lasting signatures. You can also take advantage of social media, and compare samples in Maxwell against those posted on Twitter by researchers, such as @kafeine, @malware_traffic and @BroadAnalysis.
 
Hunting for Exploit Kits
With the architecture and detection capabilities in place, it’s time to start hunting. But which websites should be explored to find evil stuff? A surprisingly effective technique is to continually cycle through the Alexa top 25,000 or top 100,000 websites, which can be streamlined by browsing five websites at a time instead of one, and get a 5x boost on your processing capability. In less than 24 hours, you can crawl through 25,000 websites with just a handful of virtual machines. The only down side is losing the ability to know exactly which of the five websites was compromised without manually looking through the PCAP. If you have a good traffic anonymizing service, you can just reprocess each of the five websites.
At DerbyCon 6.0 Recharge, the Maxwell research was presented for the first time and we released the code under an MIT license. You can find it on GitHub. We look forward to to comments, contributions, and suggestions for advancements. Maxwell has proven extremely useful in fully automating the detection and analysis of exploit kits and watering holes. Ideally, Maxwell can help both red and blue teamers test an organization’s defenses without requiring extensive resources or significant time. It also greatly simplifies a key pain point for researchers - actually collecting the samples. By hunting for exploit kits with Maxwell, researchers can spend more time analyzing and building defenses against exploit kits, instead of searching for them.

“Enterprises can no longer sit back and wait for threat data to come to them. The next generation of security challenges requires a more proactive approach to detect and respond to threats that have evaded defensive technologies. I have found Endgame’s Hunt platform helpful in allowing an analyst to quickly detect never-before-visible malicious behaviors on host systems, and block and remove threats in real-time."  

— Ryan Gurr, Information Security Manager at NuScale Power
 

 


“Endgame’s platform elevates our tier 1 analysts to operate at a tier 3 level, allowing us to spend less time and resources on incident response and compromise assessment. With Endgame, we can prevent, detect, and proactively hunt advanced attacks at the earliest possible moment, before damage and loss of critical assets.”
— Dan Basile, Information Security Officer, Texas A&M
 

 


“ The rules of the game have changed.  Organizations are compromised and need to hunt for adversaries in their networks. Endgame’s approach to threat hunting will better equip organizations with the tools necessary to stop advanced adversaries at the earliest stages.” 
— Dr. Eric Cole, Secure Anchor Consulting, Former SANS Instructor
