DALLAS, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:    PBT) ("Permian") today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.040754 per unit, payable on August 14, 2017, to unit holders of record on July 31, 2017.








This month's distribution decreased from the previous month due to a decline in oil and gas production for the Waddell Ranch properties.  Pricing for oil slightly declined offset by a slight increase in the pricing of gas for the Waddell Ranch properties.  The Texas Royalty Properties had a slight increase in oil and gas production as well as an increase in the pricing of oil production.  This was offset by a decrease in the pricing of gas.   
Capital expenditures on the Waddell Ranch continue to be lower than previous months, with it being mostly facility projects for the remainder of the year. However, additional expense will be incurred bringing the Tubb McKnight Water Station back on line of approximately $1,228,000 (gross) to the entire project of working interest owners.  It is not clear at this time as to what the cost to Trust will be until it is incurred and charged to the Trust.  It is anticipated that these expenses will be forthcoming in the following months.
WADDELL RANCHProduction for the underlying properties at the Waddell Ranch was 53,903 barrels of oil and 323,454 Mcf of gas.  The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Waddell Ranch was 13,498 barrels of oil and 99,929 Mcf of gas.  The average price for oil was $44.74 per bbl and for gas was $3.09 per Mcf.  This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of May for oil and the month of April for gas. These allocated volumes were significantly impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas. Also, the previously mentioned prior period adjustments affected the net barrels and Mcfs allocated to the trust for this month.
This production and pricing for the Underlying Properties resulted in revenues for the Waddell Ranch Properties of $3,410,228.  Deducted from these would be the Lease Operating Expense (LOE) of $1,901,654, taxes of $119,824, and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) of $174,067 totaling $2,195,545 resulting in a Net Profit of $1,214,683 for the month of June.  With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 75% of the underlying properties, this would result in a net contribution by the Waddell Ranch Properties of $911,012 to this month's distribution.

TEXAS ROYALTY PROPERTIESProduction for the underlying properties at the Texas Royalties was 24,880 barrels of oil and 28,880 Mcf of gas.  The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Texas Royalties was 23,636 barrels of oil and 27,436 Mcf of gas.  The average price for oil was $45.55 per bbl and for gas was $4.68 per Mcf.  This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of May for oil and the month of April for gas. These allocated volumes were impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas.  
This production and pricing for the underlying properties resulted in revenues for the Texas Royalties of $1,268,478.  Deducted from these would be taxes of $176,594 resulting in a Net Profit of $1,091,884 for the month of June.  With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 95% of the Underlying Properties, this would result in net contribution by the Texas Royalties of $1,037,290 to this month's distribution.
General and Administrative Expenses deducted for the month were $49,810 resulting in a distribution of $1,899,531 to 46,608,796 units outstanding, or $0.040754 per unit.
The worldwide market conditions continue to affect the pricing for domestic production.  It is difficult to predict what effect these conditions will have on future distributions.

Permian Basin Royalty Trust


The Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: PBT) is a United States oil and natural gas royalty trust based in Dallas, Texas. With a market capitalization of US $790,000,000, and an average daily trading volume of about 186,000 shares at the end of 2007, it is one of the largest royalty trusts in the United States. Its source of revenue is oil and gas pumped from the geologic formation for which it is named, the Permian Basin in west Texas, as well as a few locations in other parts of the state.
Most of the Trust's properties are on the Waddell Ranch in Crane County, Texas, where it owns a 75% net overriding royalty interest in the fee mineral interests (in this case, oil and natural gas). Other properties of the trust are in 32 other Texas counties, most of which are in the western portion of the state, on the High Plains; the trust owns a 95% net overriding royalty interest in all of its properties outside of the Waddell Ranch.[1]
The principal productive zones for oil on the Waddell Ranch are in two geologic units, the Grayburg and the San Andreas, at a depth of from 2,800 to 3,400 feet (1,000 m) below ground surface; however there are a total of 12 producing zones on the ranch, including one at a depth of 10,600 feet (3,200 m). As of the end of 2006, there were a total of 800 operational and productive oil wells and 205 natural gas wells on the Waddell Ranch in the Trust. On December 31, 2006, the Trust claimed a lifetime of approximately 8.3 years for all mineral reserves of the Trust.[2]
Permin Basin Royalty Trust came into being in November 1980, with an agreement between Southland Royalty Company and the First National Bank of Fort Worth. As is the case with U.S. royalty trusts, the trust cannot function as a business, and has no employees; all operations and maintenance are carried out by the Trustee and its subcontractors. Currently, the assets of the Trust are managed by ConocoPhillips, which acquired Meridian Oil, the previous operator. Meridian changed its name to Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company, LP, in 1996, prior to being acquired by ConocoPhillips in 2006.[2][3]
The Trust pays a relatively high dividend, yielding an annual rate of 12.4% in early 2008; in addition, it pays out monthly, a relative rarity for U.S. stocks. However, its distribution is dependent on the prices of oil and gas; thus, unlike traditional stocks (who, when declaring a dividend, usually maintain it at the same amount for each quarter of the year), the dividend payout will differ each month.
Since the Trust's assets are considered a depletable resource, its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather as return of capital instead of return on investment; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to all royalty trusts.[4][5]

DALLAS, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:    PBT) ("Permian") today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.040754 per unit, payable on August 14, 2017, to unit holders of record on July 31, 2017.








This month's distribution decreased from the previous month due to a decline in oil and gas production for the Waddell Ranch properties.  Pricing for oil slightly declined offset by a slight increase in the pricing of gas for the Waddell Ranch properties.  The Texas Royalty Properties had a slight increase in oil and gas production as well as an increase in the pricing of oil production.  This was offset by a decrease in the pricing of gas.   
Capital expenditures on the Waddell Ranch continue to be lower than previous months, with it being mostly facility projects for the remainder of the year. However, additional expense will be incurred bringing the Tubb McKnight Water Station back on line of approximately $1,228,000 (gross) to the entire project of working interest owners.  It is not clear at this time as to what the cost to Trust will be until it is incurred and charged to the Trust.  It is anticipated that these expenses will be forthcoming in the following months.
WADDELL RANCHProduction for the underlying properties at the Waddell Ranch was 53,903 barrels of oil and 323,454 Mcf of gas.  The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Waddell Ranch was 13,498 barrels of oil and 99,929 Mcf of gas.  The average price for oil was $44.74 per bbl and for gas was $3.09 per Mcf.  This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of May for oil and the month of April for gas. These allocated volumes were significantly impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas. Also, the previously mentioned prior period adjustments affected the net barrels and Mcfs allocated to the trust for this month.
This production and pricing for the Underlying Properties resulted in revenues for the Waddell Ranch Properties of $3,410,228.  Deducted from these would be the Lease Operating Expense (LOE) of $1,901,654, taxes of $119,824, and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) of $174,067 totaling $2,195,545 resulting in a Net Profit of $1,214,683 for the month of June.  With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 75% of the underlying properties, this would result in a net contribution by the Waddell Ranch Properties of $911,012 to this month's distribution.

TEXAS ROYALTY PROPERTIESProduction for the underlying properties at the Texas Royalties was 24,880 barrels of oil and 28,880 Mcf of gas.  The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Texas Royalties was 23,636 barrels of oil and 27,436 Mcf of gas.  The average price for oil was $45.55 per bbl and for gas was $4.68 per Mcf.  This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of May for oil and the month of April for gas. These allocated volumes were impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas.  
This production and pricing for the underlying properties resulted in revenues for the Texas Royalties of $1,268,478.  Deducted from these would be taxes of $176,594 resulting in a Net Profit of $1,091,884 for the month of June.  With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 95% of the Underlying Properties, this would result in net contribution by the Texas Royalties of $1,037,290 to this month's distribution.
General and Administrative Expenses deducted for the month were $49,810 resulting in a distribution of $1,899,531 to 46,608,796 units outstanding, or $0.040754 per unit.
The worldwide market conditions continue to affect the pricing for domestic production.  It is difficult to predict what effect these conditions will have on future distributions.

WADDELL RANCHProduction for the underlying properties at the Waddell Ranch was 53,903 barrels of oil and 323,454 Mcf of gas.  The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Waddell Ranch was 13,498 barrels of oil and 99,929 Mcf of gas.  The average price for oil was $44.74 per bbl and for gas was $3.09 per Mcf.  This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of May for oil and the month of April for gas. These allocated volumes were significantly impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas. Also, the previously mentioned prior period adjustments affected the net barrels and Mcfs allocated to the trust for this month.
This production and pricing for the Underlying Properties resulted in revenues for the Waddell Ranch Properties of $3,410,228.  Deducted from these would be the Lease Operating Expense (LOE) of $1,901,654, taxes of $119,824, and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) of $174,067 totaling $2,195,545 resulting in a Net Profit of $1,214,683 for the month of June.  With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 75% of the underlying properties, this would result in a net contribution by the Waddell Ranch Properties of $911,012 to this month's distribution.

TEXAS ROYALTY PROPERTIESProduction for the underlying properties at the Texas Royalties was 24,880 barrels of oil and 28,880 Mcf of gas.  The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Texas Royalties was 23,636 barrels of oil and 27,436 Mcf of gas.  The average price for oil was $45.55 per bbl and for gas was $4.68 per Mcf.  This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of May for oil and the month of April for gas. These allocated volumes were impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas.  
This production and pricing for the underlying properties resulted in revenues for the Texas Royalties of $1,268,478.  Deducted from these would be taxes of $176,594 resulting in a Net Profit of $1,091,884 for the month of June.  With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 95% of the Underlying Properties, this would result in net contribution by the Texas Royalties of $1,037,290 to this month's distribution.
General and Administrative Expenses deducted for the month were $49,810 resulting in a distribution of $1,899,531 to 46,608,796 units outstanding, or $0.040754 per unit.
The worldwide market conditions continue to affect the pricing for domestic production.  It is difficult to predict what effect these conditions will have on future distributions.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in. We’re a marketplace where these types of royalty assets are bought and sold. We specialize in intellectual property with a documented track record of regular, consistent income.

Through our one-of-a-kind platform, investors can buy privately owned royalty rights directly from the artists, inventors and creators. In a world of negative interest rates, these income-generating royalty rights just might be the perfect investment.

Why we will get you the best deal
For too long songwriters and musicians have sold their catalogs or sought advances in backroom deals that often left them with a very bad result. But there are tens of thousands of investors outside the music industry interested in acquiring royalties willing to provide much better options.
If you've tried to leverage your catalog or raise money in the past, you know how difficult it can be to find willing investors with the capital you need. Royalty Exchange is the marketplace where this takes place. We’ve assembled and vetted all the investors on our site. So you can get instant access to a large group of investors that would be impossible to attract on your own.
That's why we've been able to get creatives much better deals than anybody else out there. And that's why, if you're looking to raise money — you're in the right place.

We only get paid if the deal gets done on your terms. If you don't successfully raise money, you don't owe us a dime.Fast: We can put together a custom deal for you, market it, and close the fundraising in less than 30 days. We have a team of attorneys, accountants, and analysts that can make these deals happen fast. If you want to get started on your next project ASAP, we'll help you make it happen.

We've done auctions for a single song, part or all of a catalog, and more.

You have complete control over what you want to do to hit your fundraising goals.Keep all of your future work. We connect you with investors who are interested in your back catalog only. That means you can use your older work to finance new projects or major purchases. And you can do it without giving up any creative control or copyrights on your future projects. Many of the creatives we've worked with have leveraged their back catalog in order to fund their new album, film, or other project.


    








Why other creatives like you have worked with us
Since 2013, we’ve helped recording artists, songwriters, and other creative rightsholders raise millions. More than half have returned to conduct additional auctions, or have personally recommended us to their peers. 
We've helped them raise money to fund a documentary about women in Africa. We've helped artists and songwriters build out home studios. We've even helped a songwriter raise money to buy a rental property in New York.
James Michael Thomas, who wrote the hook for the hit Kanye song “Mercy” came to us first with an emergency, and returned for a second time with a plan. We helped him raise nearly $20,000 which he put to good use! [Read More]
Alicia Angel, who wrote a number of songs in the children's show “Dora and Friends” wanted to finance a project she was deeply passionate about: a documentary about the cruel treatment of women in certain African nations. We helped Alicia fund her documentary and spread the word about this critical issue. [Read More]
Brian Maher, a top-tier songwriter in Nashville, wrote the hit song “Til My Last Day” performed by Justin Moore. He sold part of his writer's share of that single song and raised money to finance his career and help provide a little extra for his family. We helped him raise more than $50,000 in a day.
We've helped a company that owns an enormous catalog of iconic celebrity photos raise more than $300,000 to acquire more amazing photos and bring a new line of beautiful and affordable collectibles to markets everywhere. We've helped provide them the funding they need to grow their business.
Those are just a few of the many creatives that we've helped raise money through Royalty Exchange's platform. We hope you'll be next.

Permian Basin Royalty Trust


The Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: PBT) is a United States oil and natural gas royalty trust based in Dallas, Texas. With a market capitalization of US $790,000,000, and an average daily trading volume of about 186,000 shares at the end of 2007, it is one of the largest royalty trusts in the United States. Its source of revenue is oil and gas pumped from the geologic formation for which it is named, the Permian Basin in west Texas, as well as a few locations in other parts of the state.
Most of the Trust's properties are on the Waddell Ranch in Crane County, Texas, where it owns a 75% net overriding royalty interest in the fee mineral interests (in this case, oil and natural gas). Other properties of the trust are in 32 other Texas counties, most of which are in the western portion of the state, on the High Plains; the trust owns a 95% net overriding royalty interest in all of its properties outside of the Waddell Ranch.[1]
The principal productive zones for oil on the Waddell Ranch are in two geologic units, the Grayburg and the San Andreas, at a depth of from 2,800 to 3,400 feet (1,000 m) below ground surface; however there are a total of 12 producing zones on the ranch, including one at a depth of 10,600 feet (3,200 m). As of the end of 2006, there were a total of 800 operational and productive oil wells and 205 natural gas wells on the Waddell Ranch in the Trust. On December 31, 2006, the Trust claimed a lifetime of approximately 8.3 years for all mineral reserves of the Trust.[2]
Permin Basin Royalty Trust came into being in November 1980, with an agreement between Southland Royalty Company and the First National Bank of Fort Worth. As is the case with U.S. royalty trusts, the trust cannot function as a business, and has no employees; all operations and maintenance are carried out by the Trustee and its subcontractors. Currently, the assets of the Trust are managed by ConocoPhillips, which acquired Meridian Oil, the previous operator. Meridian changed its name to Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company, LP, in 1996, prior to being acquired by ConocoPhillips in 2006.[2][3]
The Trust pays a relatively high dividend, yielding an annual rate of 12.4% in early 2008; in addition, it pays out monthly, a relative rarity for U.S. stocks. However, its distribution is dependent on the prices of oil and gas; thus, unlike traditional stocks (who, when declaring a dividend, usually maintain it at the same amount for each quarter of the year), the dividend payout will differ each month.
Since the Trust's assets are considered a depletable resource, its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather as return of capital instead of return on investment; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to all royalty trusts.[4][5]
