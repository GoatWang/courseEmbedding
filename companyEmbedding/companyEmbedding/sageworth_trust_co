Sageworth Trust Co Holds Stake in iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ)
Paterniano Del Favero
Luglio 26, 2017



Condividere













The recent price of 50.28 for shares of iShares Short Maturity Bond ETF (NEAR) has put the price level above the Balance Step, indicating a near-term bullish pattern developing.The firm owned 5,000 shares of the exchange traded fund's stock at the end of the second quarter. iShares MSCI Japan ETF comprises about 0.1% of Sageworth Trust Co's investment portfolio, making the stock its 29th largest position.Taking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 69.26, the 7-day sits at 71.63 and the 14-day (most common) is at 64.07. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A reading between -80 to -100 may be typically viewed as strong oversold territory.IShares MSCI EM ConsumerGrowth UCITS ETF USD (CEMG.L) now has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 124.65. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a versatile tool that may be used to help spot an emerging trend or provide warning of extreme conditions. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction.Currently, the 14-day ADX for Wisdomtree Issuer Plc (DEM.L) is sitting at 15.20. In general, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend.The Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to discern if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone was created to measure trend strength.IShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R now sits at -5.40. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. Currently, iShares 0-5 Year Invest Grade Corporate Bond ETF (SLQD) has a 14-day ATR of 0.06. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. One of the more popular combinations is to use the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. They may also be used to help spot support and resistance levels. Using the moving average for technical equity analysis is still very popular among traders and investors.Technical analysts may be interested in how iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol EAFE Index ETF (EFAV) is trading in relation to some moving averages. The RSI is considered to be an internal strength indicator, not to be confused with relative strength which is compared to other stocks and indices.Receive News & Ratings Via Email - Enter your email address below to receive a concise daily summary of the latest news and analysts' ratings with MarketBeat.com's FREE daily email newsletter.

Why Sageworth


Sageworth works with highly successful families to manage the challenges and opportunities that arise from substantial wealth. As a private trust company, shared family office and full-service wealth management firm, Sageworth offers its clients an integrated approach to growing and preserving their family’s wealth.
Sageworth was founded in 2001 by Tim Brown and the principals of six prominent families to:

Ensure stability and continuity in their families’ financial affairs for generations
Take ownership of the management of their investments and planning activities
Obtain the services of a dedicated, trusted and talented professional staff
Share services alongside other successful families

Since then, Sageworth has grown to serve over 80 family groups located throughout the United States and internationally who share similar needs and objectives.
Sageworth develops an in-depth understanding of each client’s accumulated wealth and exactly what it means to them. We give our clients the confidence and comfort that their legacy is secure… for both them and future generations.

Culture
Sageworth’s culture reflects the families we serve. We are hardworking, disciplined, results-oriented and practical. We genuinely care about every family member. We are large enough to provide world-class service, yet small enough to be on a first name basis with every client.


Core Values

Preservation and growth of family wealth across generations
Alignment of interests among clients, management and owners
Stability and long-term focus
Transparency and confidentiality
Clear and frequent communication



People
Sageworth’s highly experienced professional staff have backgrounds in investment management, law, accounting, trusts & estates, and banking. Working closely together as a team, our staff is focused exclusively on serving each client’s unique needs.





"It is a great comfort to know my children are getting advice from people who both know their individual situation and the family’s situation, and know our values and the legacy that has been created for our family."
