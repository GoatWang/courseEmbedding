= Crude Oil
= Pipeline
= Terminals
= Natural Gas Liquids

= Refined Products
= Crude Oil Acquisition & Marketing




























Crude Oil Acquisition & Marketing
 
					From the wellhead of the lease to the refinery, the crude oil supply chain can be complex. Our Crude Oil Acquisition and Marketing organization purchases crude from producers at the wellhead and at trade locations, and then sells it to a refiner or other purchasers. We strive to keep our purchases and sales balanced, with each purchased barrel matched to a barrel sold, thereby minimizing commodity price exposure.
				






Crude Trucking
 
					Our Crude Oil Acquisition and Marketing business gathers, purchases, markets and sells crude oil using approximately 300 crude oil transport trucks and approximately 120 crude oil truck unloading facilities.
					Sunoco Logistics' Crude Trucking department is part of Sunoco Logistics' Crude Acquisition business. We currently haul crude oil in Oklahoma, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, and Louisiana to truck stations throughout these regions. Our truck fleet helps aggregate the crude oil purchased from individual leases. Our growing fleet currently consists of over 350 Model 365 Peterbilt tractor/trailer combinations,. Each tractor is combined with a 200 barrel tanker. We currently employ approximately 500+ drivers and are aggressively hiring.
				






Crude Oil
 
					Our Crude Oil Pipeline System transports crude oil principally in Oklahoma and Texas. The segment consists of approximately 5,900 miles of crude oil trunk and gathering pipelines. This includes our wholly-owned interest in West Texas Gulf and a controlling financial interest in Mid-Valley Pipeline Company.
				






Natural Gas Liquids
 
					Natural gas is a hydrocarbon that can be gathered and processed to produce natural gas liquids (NGLs), also known as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). NGLs are separated from the natural gas stream through a process called fractionation into purity products such as ethane, propane, butane, iso butane, and pentane.  These purity products can be used in petrochemical plants, burned for home heating and cooking, and blended into gasoline.   Our extensive infrastructure and assets allow us to store, blend, and transport NGLs and LPG to major markets.  In addition, our growth projects, Mariner East and Mariner West, will provide a comprehensive takeaway solution for natural gas liquids from the Marcellus Shale.
				






Nederland Terminal
 
					The Sunoco Logistics Nederland Terminal, located on the Sabine-Neches waterway between Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, is a large marine terminal that provides storage and distribution services for refiners and other large transporters of crude oil. The terminal receives, stores, and distributes crude oil, feedstocks, lubricants, petrochemicals, and bunker oils (used for fueling ships and other marine vessels) and also blends lubricants. The terminal currently has a total storage capacity of approximately 24 million barrels with individual tank capacities of up to 660,000 barrels.
					In addition to crude oil activities, the Nederland Terminal also provides approximately 1 million barrels of storage and distribution services for NGLs.
				






Eagle Point Terminal
 
					The Sunoco Logistics Eagle Point terminal, located in Westville, NJ on the banks of the Delaware River near Philadelphia, PA, is a 6 million barrel refined product and crude oil terminal including a dock facility, a truck rack, pipeline access, gasoline blending manifold, and rail access. The terminal receives, stores, blends, and distributes:  crude oil, ethanol, gasoline, gasoline components, Naphtha, ULSD, heating oil, jet fuel, distillate components, vacuum gas oil, and has the capability to distribute chemicals. The docks match the Delaware River capacity with drafts up to 40 feet and can accommodate vessels as large as a typical Suezmax tanker.
				






Marcus Hook Industrial Complex
 
					The Marcus Hook Industrial Complex, located primarily in Marcus Hook PA, on the banks of the Delaware River, is an LPG and refined products terminal as well as a fully functioning process complex. The terminal has approximately 3 million barrels of NGL storage in underground caverns and related commercial agreements and 1 million barrels of refined products storage capacity. The facility can receive NGL and refined products via marine vessel, pipeline, truck, and rail, and can deliver via marine vessel, pipeline, and truck. In addition to providing storage and terminal services, MHIC currently serves as an off-take for our Mariner East I system.
				






Terminals
 
					Our Terminal Facilities consists of 40 active refined products marketing terminals with an aggregate storage capacity of 8 million barrels, which provide storage, terminalling, blending and other ancillary services primarily to our Refined Products Pipelines.
				






Pipeline
 
					We operate  approximately 8,600 miles of pipeline across the US.  Our vast pipeline network transports crude oil, natural gas liquids and refined products.  We strive to increase pipeline throughput, utilizing our crude oil distribution and marketing expertise to address regional crude oil supply and demand imbalances, and pursuing organic growth opportunities as well as strategic acquisitions that are synergistic with existing assets.
				






Refined Products
 
					The Sunoco Logistics Refined Products Pipeline System consists of approximately 1,800 miles of refined products pipelines in the Northeast, Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States.
					These products are transported to markets in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Texas, and Canada. The refined products transported in these pipelines include multiple grades of gasoline and middle distillates (such as heating oil, diesel, and jet fuel).

Crude Oil





View Larger
Our Crude Oil business consists of an integrated set of pipeline, terminalling, and acquisition and marketing assets that service the movement of crude oil from producers to end-user markets.
Crude Oil Pipelines
The crude oil pipelines consist of approximately 6,100 miles of crude oil trunk and gathering pipelines in the southwest and midwest United States, including our wholly-owned interest in West Texas Gulf and PET; and a controlling financial interest in Mid-Valley Pipeline Company ("Mid-Valley"). Additionally, we have equity ownership interests in two crude oil pipelines. Our pipelines provide access to several trading hubs, including the largest trading hub for crude oil in the United States located in Cushing, Oklahoma, and other trading hubs located in Midland, Colorado City and Longview, Texas. Our crude oil pipelines also deliver to and connect with other pipelines that deliver crude oil to a number of refineries.
Revenues throughout our crude oil pipeline systems are generated from tariffs paid by shippers utilizing our transportation services. These tariffs are filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions ("FERC") and other state regulatory agencies, as applicable.
Southwest United States Pipelines
Our pipelines include crude oil trunk pipelines and crude oil gathering pipelines in Texas. This includes our Permian Express 2 pipeline project which provides takeaway capacity from the Permian Basin, with origins in multiple locations in Western Texas: Midland, Garden City and Colorado City.  With an initial capacity of approximately 200 thousand barrels per day, Permian Express 2 began delivery to multiple refiners and markets in the third quarter 2015. Our fourth quarter 2016 acquisition of a West Texas crude oil system from Vitol and the remaining ownership interest in PET facilitates connection of our Permian Express 2 pipeline to terminal assets in Midland and Garden City, Texas. 
In the third quarter 2016, we commenced operations on the Delaware Basin Extension and Permian Longview and Louisiana Extension pipeline projects. The Delaware Basin Extension pipeline project provides shippers with new takeaway capacity from the rapidly growing Delaware Basin area in New Mexico and West Texas to Midland, Texas. The project has initial capacity to transport approximately 100 thousand barrels per day. The Permian Longview and Louisiana Extension pipeline project provides takeaway capacity for approximately 100 thousand additional barrels per day out of the Permian Basin at Midland, Texas to be transported to the Longview, Texas area as well as destinations in Louisiana utilizing a combination of our proprietary crude oil system as well as third party pipelines. We own and operate crude oil pipeline and gathering systems in Oklahoma. We have the ability to deliver substantially all of the crude oil gathered on our Oklahoma system to Cushing. We are one of the largest purchasers of crude oil from producers in the state, and our crude oil acquisition and marketing activities business is the primary shipper on our Oklahoma crude oil system. 
 
Midwest United States Pipelines
We own a controlling financial interest in the Mid-Valley pipeline system which originates in Longview, Texas and passes through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio, and terminates in Samaria, Michigan. This pipeline provides crude oil to a number of refineries, primarily in the midwest United States. In addition, we own a crude oil pipeline that runs from Marysville, Michigan to Toledo, Ohio, and a truck injection point for local production at Marysville. This pipeline receives crude oil from the Enbridge Mainline Pipeline system for delivery to refineries located in Toledo, Ohio and to Marathon's Samaria, Michigan tank farm, which supplies its refinery in Detroit, Michigan.
Nederland Terminal
The Nederland terminal, located on the Sabine-Neches waterway between Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, is a large marine terminal providing storage and distribution services for refiners and other large transporters of crude oil and NGLs. The terminal receives, stores, and distributes crude oil and bunker oils (used for fueling ships and other marine vessels), and has a total crude oil storage capacity of approximately 26 million barrels in approximately 150 aboveground storage tanks with individual capacities of up to 660 thousand barrels.
The Nederland terminal can receive crude oil at each of its five ship docks and three barge berths. The five ship docks are capable of receiving over 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. In addition to our crude oil pipelines, the terminal can also receive crude oil through a number of third-party pipelines, including the Department of Energy (“DOE”). The DOE pipelines connect the terminal to the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve's West Hackberry caverns at Hackberry, Louisiana and Big Hill near Winnie, Texas, which have an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 395 million barrels.
The Nederland terminal can deliver crude oil via pipeline, barge and ship. The terminal has two ship docks and three barge berths that are capable of delivering crude oils for international transport. In total, the terminal is capable of delivering over 2 million barrels of crude oil per day to our crude oil pipelines or a number of third-party pipelines, including the DOE. The Nederland terminal generates crude oil revenues primarily by providing term or spot storage services and throughput capabilities to a number of customers. 
Fort Mifflin Terminal Complex
The Fort Mifflin Terminal Complex is located on the Delaware River in Philadelphia and includes the Fort Mifflin Terminal, the Hog Island Wharf, the Darby Creek Tank Farm and connecting pipelines. Revenues are generated at the Fort Mifflin Terminal Complex by charging fees based on throughput.
The Fort Mifflin Terminal contains two ship docks with freshwater drafts and a total storage capacity of approximately 570 thousand barrels. Crude oil enters the Fort Mifflin Terminal primarily from marine vessels on the Delaware River. One Fort Mifflin dock is designed to handle crude oil from very large crude carrier-class ("VLCC") tankers and smaller crude oil vessels.
The other dock can accommodate only smaller crude oil vessels. The Hog Island Wharf is located next to the Fort Mifflin Terminal on the Delaware River and receives crude oil via two ship docks, one of which can accommodate crude oil tankers and smaller crude oil vessels, and the other of which can accommodate some smaller crude oil vessels.
The Darby Creek Tank Farm is a crude oil storage terminal for the Philadelphia refinery, which is operated by Philadelphia Energy Solutions ("PES") under a joint venture with Sunoco, Inc. ("Sunoco"). This facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 3 million barrels. Darby Creek receives crude oil from the Fort Mifflin Terminal and Hog Island Wharf via our pipelines. The tank farm then stores the crude oil and transports it to the Philadelphia refinery via our pipelines.
Eagle Point Terminal
The Eagle Point Terminal is located in Westville, New Jersey and consists of docks, truck loading facilities and a tank farm. The docks are located on the Delaware River and can accommodate three marine vessels (ships or barges) to receive and deliver crude oil to outbound ships and barges. The tank farm has a total active crude oil storage capacity of approximately 1 million barrels and can receive crude oil via barge, pipeline and rail, and deliver via barge, truck or pipeline, providing customers with access to various markets. The terminal generates revenue primarily by charging fees based on throughput, blending services and storage.
Midland Terminal
The Midland terminal is located in Midland, Texas and was acquired in November 2016 from Vitol. The facility includes approximately 2 million barrels of crude oil storage, a combined 14 lanes of truck loading and unloading, and will provide access to the Permian Express 2 transportation system.
 
Crude Oil Acquisition and Marketing
These activities include the acquisition and marketing of crude oil, primarily in the mid-continent United States. The operations are conducted using our assets, which include approximately 370 crude oil transport trucks and approximately 150 crude oil truck unloading facilities, as well as third-party truck, rail and marine assets.

Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Sunoco is an American petroleum and petrochemical manufacturer headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, United States, formerly known as Sun Company Inc. (1886–1920 and 1976–1998) and Sun Oil Co. (1920–1976). Sunoco is one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States, with Sunoco brand gasoline being sold in over 4,700 outlets spanning 26 states,[3] just over a third hosting convenience stores.[4] Since 2012, Sunoco has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, based in Dallas, Texas.
In 2011, it was ranked as the third largest company by revenue in Pennsylvania, after AmerisourceBergen and Comcast.[5] In 2011, the company decided to exit the oil refinery business.[6]
In Canada, the Sunoco brand was licensed for the Ontario retail gas station operations of Suncor Energy until 2010. Following Suncor's acquisition of Petro-Canada, all Canadian Sunoco outlets were converted to Petro-Canada branding.
In 2017, it was announced that 1,110 Sunoco convenience stores would be sold to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven, for $3.3 billion. Also, as a part of the deal, Sunoco also said they would be supplying 2.2 billion gallons of fuel annually for 15 years to 7-Eleven convenience stores.[7]

History[edit]
1800s to 1900s: founding and growth[edit]
The integrated oil company now known as Sunoco began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1886, its partners – Joseph Newton Pew, Philip Pisano and Edward O. Emerson – decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in New Jersey as Sun Company and turned its interest to the new Spindletop field in Texas. Pew's sons, J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew, Jr. would take over the company after their father's death.

With a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries in hand, Sun opened its first service station in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in 1920. The name changed back to Sun Oil Company in 1922 and, in 1925, Sun became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.[8] Sun expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in Sarnia, Ontario, home to a burgeoning new petrochemical industry. Sun established a facility at Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) before the operation was nationalized in 1975.
Custom blending[edit]
Sunoco is perhaps best known to consumers for its "custom blending" pumps, an innovation that, beginning in 1956, allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several octane grades through a single pump.[citation needed] Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of "Custom Blended" gasolines from its "Dial A Grade" pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260,[citation needed] the latter a super-premium grade of 102 octane[citation needed] that was advertised as the "highest octane pump gas"[citation needed] and very popular with operators of V8-powered Muscle Cars of the 1960s.[citation needed]
1960s to 2000s: acquisitions and branding[edit]
In 1967, Sun established its Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited facility in northern Alberta, Canada, to help unlock the estimated 300 billion barrels (48 km3) of recoverable oil in the Athabasca oil sands.
In 1968, Sun Oil merged with Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Sunray DX Oil Company, which refined and marketed gasoline under the DX brand in several midwestern states, and included several refineries including one in Tulsa that was operated by Sun until its sale in June 2009 to Holly Corporation of Dallas.[9] This move expanded Sun's marketing area into the mid-continent region.
Sun Oil continued marketing its petroleum products under both the Sunoco and DX brands through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand and even introduced the high-octane Sunoco ULTRA 94 gasoline to stations in that region, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably Sinclair in Oklahoma.
With increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc., a subsidiary of The Seagram Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion—the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.
Through the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the North Sea and offshore China and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, consumers saw the arrival of Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a major restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of Atlantic Refining and Marketing (and, in effect, that company's convenience store chain, A-Plus), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former Gulf Oil refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from Chevron.
By the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994 Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia Chevron Oil refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. Sun sold its remaining interest in Canada's Suncor Energy in 1995, but markets product from two refineries – one in Toledo, Ohio, and the other Sarnia, Ontario – in joint ventures.[10] In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc. In 2011 the Toledo facility was sold to PBF Energy.
By 1998, Sun had acquired Allied Signal, Inc. chemical plants. Allied Signal, Inc. being on the stock exchange sold half of the company to Honeywell, Inc. and the other half to Sunoco, Inc. The chemical portion of the business was called "Sunoco Chemicals, Inc."
In 2003, the Speedway SuperAmerica chain of gas stations and convenience stores exited the Southeastern United States and sold most of their operations to Sunoco. Shortly prior to this, Sunoco acquired many service stations from Coastal Petroleum, especially its stations in Florida. This has led to the reintroduction of the Sunoco brand to areas it pulled out of ten years earlier. Coincidentally, Speedway would later re-enter the Southeast with its purchase of Hess Corporation's downstream operations in 2014, mirroring that of Sunoco's return to the Southeast.[11]

In 2004, Sunoco replaced ConocoPhillips' 76 brand as the official fuel of NASCAR.
After ConocoPhillips abandoned the marketing of the Mobil brand name in the Washington, DC, area, Sunoco purchased these rights, and has since been converting Maryland and Virginia Mobil stations to the Sunoco brand, bringing the A-Plus convenience store with them – prior to this, these stations had convenience stores under the Circle K or On the Run brands.
In September 2009, Sunoco announced the sale of its retail heating oil and propane distribution business to Superior Plus Corp for $82.5 million in cash.[12]
In October 2009, Sunoco announced it will idle and possibly permanently shut down its Eagle Point/Westville, NJ plant, laying off over 400 employees.
Exit from refinery business[edit]
In December 2010, Sunoco sold its refinery in Toledo, Ohio to PBF Energy for US$400,000,000.[6] Effective 6 September 2011, Sunoco announced that it would exit the crude oil refining business and seek to sell its Philadelphia and Marcus Hook refineries by mid-2012.[6] The company has said that its cost for exiting the refining business could be as high as US$2.7 billion.[6] According to one report, the company had lost some US$800,000,000 on refining operations since 2009;[1] an earlier report provided a figure of US$772,000,000.[6] On December 1, 2011, Sunoco announced it would accelerate closure of the Marcus Hook facility, with a target completion in 90 days.[1] The Marcus Hook facility, founded in 1902 and covering 781 acres, was dedicated exclusively to the processing of light sweet crude oil;[1] this processing focus combined with volatility in crude oil prices are considered contributing factors to both this refinery's closure and Sunoco's exit from the refinery business.[13]
Joint venture with Carlyle Group[edit]
After weeks of negotiations, it was announced that Sunoco would be forming a joint venture with the Carlyle Group, allowing for the continuation of operations at the Philadelphia refinery, and saving over 800 jobs.[14] The joint venture began in late 2012.
Sale to Energy Transfer Partners and merger with Susser Holdings[edit]
In 2012, Dallas-based energy company Energy Transfer Partners purchased Sunoco, making Sunoco a wholly owned subsidiary.[15] As Energy Transfer Partners was more interested in Sunoco's pipeline and refining business that the company was originally planning on exiting, it led to speculation that Energy Transfer Partners would eventually spin-off Sunoco's retail business or sell it outright to a competitor.[16]
In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners announced its purchase of Susser Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Stripes Convenience Stores, and plans on merging it into Sunoco.[16] Upon completion of the merger, Sunoco will be placed into a limited partnership called Susser Petroleum Partners L.P., in which Energy Transfer will have an ownership stake. The deal saw the arrival of the Sunoco brand in Texas, where it replaced Valero at the Stripes locations; Stripes and A-Plus remain separate brands. Also in 2014, Sunoco acquired Aloha Petroleum.[17]
In 2015, Sunoco entered into an agreement to purchase MD America operations in east Texas.[16] That same year, Sunoco became a Subway franchisee by opening Subway at the North Midway Service Plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Bedford, Pennsylvania.
Exclusive deals[edit]
In addition to their sponsorship deal with NASCAR, Sunoco also has exclusive deals as the gasoline supplier at the travel plazas along the Ohio Turnpike,[18] Pennsylvania Turnpike,[19] New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway,[20] Atlantic City Expressway,[21] Palisades Parkway, and Delaware Turnpike.[22] Sunoco also operates some of the filling stations on the New York Thruway, as well as the two service areas - Chesapeake House and Maryland House - along Interstate 95 in Maryland.
In addition, Sunoco also owns & operates a station with an A-Plus convenience store at Pittsburgh International Airport, as Sunoco has a very large market share in Pittsburgh. Due to its large presence in Western Pennsylvania, Sunoco is a longtime sponsor of the Pittsburgh Pirates, with an advertisement for Sunoco being present in left field at PNC Park.[23]
Sunoco became the official current fuel supplier of the IZOD IndyCar Series (now the Verizon IndyCar Series) in mid-2010.[24]
Sale of stores to Seven & I Holdings Co.[edit]
On April 4, 2017 Sunoco announced it would sell 1,110 convenience stores to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven,[7] as well as supply 2.2 billion gallons of fuel to 7-Eleven convenience stores annually for 15 years. The company also announced they would be selling 200 more stores to Seven & I by the end of Q4, 2017.
Environmental record[edit]
Sunoco was the only oil company to initially sign the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) principal. However, as of March, 2016, Sunoco is not listed as a Ceres Coalition or Company Network member of Ceres.[25]
In 2000, Sunoco leaked 190,000 gallons of oil into the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania through a cracked pipe. Sunoco's safety systems did not detect the leak, which was reported by a hiker in the Wildlife Refuge.[26]
Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz, for whom the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge is named, was killed on April 4, 1991, when a Sun Company helicopter collided with an airplane carrying the Senator. (Sun Company is the predecessor of Sunoco). That accident also killed two children at the Merion Elementary School playground, into which debris from the two aircraft fell after the collision. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident included poor judgment on the part of the captain of the Sun Company helicopter, and his failure to maintain safe separation from the Senator’s airplane.[27]
As of March, 2016, records maintained by the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) show that Sunoco has experienced 257 hazardous liquids incidents since 2006. (PHMSA defines an "incident" as an event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of liquefied natural gas or gas from an LNG facility that results in a death, or injury necessitating hospitalization; or property damage of $50,000 or more). These 257 incidents resulted in $46,936,215 of property damage. In terms of number of incidents, Sunoco has the worst safety record of 1,518 active pipeline operators who report operating data to PHMSA.[28]
In 2014, Sunoco, along with other defendants, was sued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which alleged that Sunoco and the other defendants polluted the waters of the Commonwealth with MTBE, a gasoline additive. The Commonwealth also alleged that the defendants, including Sunoco, improperly accepted state funding to clean up spills which occurred prior to 1994, and which were therefore not covered by the fund.

Sunoco was Penske Racing's sponsor of choice for many years, particularly in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, where Roger Penske's Sunoco Camaros won the championship in 1968 and 1969. Sunoco also sponsored Penske Porsches in the SCCA Can-Am series, and won the Indianapolis 500 in 1972 with Penske and driver Mark Donohue.
In 1989, NASCAR team owner Billy Hagan acquired sponsorship from Sunoco for four seasons. Sterling Marlin drove the #94 Sunoco Ultra94 Oldsmobile during the 1989-90 seasons and Terry Labonte for the 91-92 seasons.
In 2015, Sunoco became the Official Fuel of the NHRA.
In 2016, as part of the Daytona update coinciding with the 2016 Daytona 500, a NASCAR version of the Toyota Camry with Sunoco as its main sponsor appears in Real Racing 3.

Sunoco is an American petroleum and petrochemical manufacturer headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, United States, formerly known as Sun Company Inc. (1886–1920 and 1976–1998) and Sun Oil Co. (1920–1976). Sunoco is one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States, with Sunoco brand gasoline being sold in over 4,700 outlets spanning 26 states,[3] just over a third hosting convenience stores.[4] Since 2012, Sunoco has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, based in Dallas, Texas.
In 2011, it was ranked as the third largest company by revenue in Pennsylvania, after AmerisourceBergen and Comcast.[5] In 2011, the company decided to exit the oil refinery business.[6]
In Canada, the Sunoco brand was licensed for the Ontario retail gas station operations of Suncor Energy until 2010. Following Suncor's acquisition of Petro-Canada, all Canadian Sunoco outlets were converted to Petro-Canada branding.
In 2017, it was announced that 1,110 Sunoco convenience stores would be sold to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven, for $3.3 billion. Also, as a part of the deal, Sunoco also said they would be supplying 2.2 billion gallons of fuel annually for 15 years to 7-Eleven convenience stores.[7]

History[edit]
1800s to 1900s: founding and growth[edit]
The integrated oil company now known as Sunoco began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1886, its partners – Joseph Newton Pew, Philip Pisano and Edward O. Emerson – decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in New Jersey as Sun Company and turned its interest to the new Spindletop field in Texas. Pew's sons, J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew, Jr. would take over the company after their father's death.

With a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries in hand, Sun opened its first service station in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in 1920. The name changed back to Sun Oil Company in 1922 and, in 1925, Sun became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.[8] Sun expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in Sarnia, Ontario, home to a burgeoning new petrochemical industry. Sun established a facility at Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) before the operation was nationalized in 1975.
Custom blending[edit]
Sunoco is perhaps best known to consumers for its "custom blending" pumps, an innovation that, beginning in 1956, allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several octane grades through a single pump.[citation needed] Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of "Custom Blended" gasolines from its "Dial A Grade" pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260,[citation needed] the latter a super-premium grade of 102 octane[citation needed] that was advertised as the "highest octane pump gas"[citation needed] and very popular with operators of V8-powered Muscle Cars of the 1960s.[citation needed]
1960s to 2000s: acquisitions and branding[edit]
In 1967, Sun established its Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited facility in northern Alberta, Canada, to help unlock the estimated 300 billion barrels (48 km3) of recoverable oil in the Athabasca oil sands.
In 1968, Sun Oil merged with Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Sunray DX Oil Company, which refined and marketed gasoline under the DX brand in several midwestern states, and included several refineries including one in Tulsa that was operated by Sun until its sale in June 2009 to Holly Corporation of Dallas.[9] This move expanded Sun's marketing area into the mid-continent region.
Sun Oil continued marketing its petroleum products under both the Sunoco and DX brands through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand and even introduced the high-octane Sunoco ULTRA 94 gasoline to stations in that region, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably Sinclair in Oklahoma.
With increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc., a subsidiary of The Seagram Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion—the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.
Through the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the North Sea and offshore China and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, consumers saw the arrival of Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a major restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of Atlantic Refining and Marketing (and, in effect, that company's convenience store chain, A-Plus), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former Gulf Oil refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from Chevron.
By the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994 Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia Chevron Oil refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. Sun sold its remaining interest in Canada's Suncor Energy in 1995, but markets product from two refineries – one in Toledo, Ohio, and the other Sarnia, Ontario – in joint ventures.[10] In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc. In 2011 the Toledo facility was sold to PBF Energy.
By 1998, Sun had acquired Allied Signal, Inc. chemical plants. Allied Signal, Inc. being on the stock exchange sold half of the company to Honeywell, Inc. and the other half to Sunoco, Inc. The chemical portion of the business was called "Sunoco Chemicals, Inc."
In 2003, the Speedway SuperAmerica chain of gas stations and convenience stores exited the Southeastern United States and sold most of their operations to Sunoco. Shortly prior to this, Sunoco acquired many service stations from Coastal Petroleum, especially its stations in Florida. This has led to the reintroduction of the Sunoco brand to areas it pulled out of ten years earlier. Coincidentally, Speedway would later re-enter the Southeast with its purchase of Hess Corporation's downstream operations in 2014, mirroring that of Sunoco's return to the Southeast.[11]

In 2004, Sunoco replaced ConocoPhillips' 76 brand as the official fuel of NASCAR.
After ConocoPhillips abandoned the marketing of the Mobil brand name in the Washington, DC, area, Sunoco purchased these rights, and has since been converting Maryland and Virginia Mobil stations to the Sunoco brand, bringing the A-Plus convenience store with them – prior to this, these stations had convenience stores under the Circle K or On the Run brands.
In September 2009, Sunoco announced the sale of its retail heating oil and propane distribution business to Superior Plus Corp for $82.5 million in cash.[12]
In October 2009, Sunoco announced it will idle and possibly permanently shut down its Eagle Point/Westville, NJ plant, laying off over 400 employees.
Exit from refinery business[edit]
In December 2010, Sunoco sold its refinery in Toledo, Ohio to PBF Energy for US$400,000,000.[6] Effective 6 September 2011, Sunoco announced that it would exit the crude oil refining business and seek to sell its Philadelphia and Marcus Hook refineries by mid-2012.[6] The company has said that its cost for exiting the refining business could be as high as US$2.7 billion.[6] According to one report, the company had lost some US$800,000,000 on refining operations since 2009;[1] an earlier report provided a figure of US$772,000,000.[6] On December 1, 2011, Sunoco announced it would accelerate closure of the Marcus Hook facility, with a target completion in 90 days.[1] The Marcus Hook facility, founded in 1902 and covering 781 acres, was dedicated exclusively to the processing of light sweet crude oil;[1] this processing focus combined with volatility in crude oil prices are considered contributing factors to both this refinery's closure and Sunoco's exit from the refinery business.[13]
Joint venture with Carlyle Group[edit]
After weeks of negotiations, it was announced that Sunoco would be forming a joint venture with the Carlyle Group, allowing for the continuation of operations at the Philadelphia refinery, and saving over 800 jobs.[14] The joint venture began in late 2012.
Sale to Energy Transfer Partners and merger with Susser Holdings[edit]
In 2012, Dallas-based energy company Energy Transfer Partners purchased Sunoco, making Sunoco a wholly owned subsidiary.[15] As Energy Transfer Partners was more interested in Sunoco's pipeline and refining business that the company was originally planning on exiting, it led to speculation that Energy Transfer Partners would eventually spin-off Sunoco's retail business or sell it outright to a competitor.[16]
In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners announced its purchase of Susser Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Stripes Convenience Stores, and plans on merging it into Sunoco.[16] Upon completion of the merger, Sunoco will be placed into a limited partnership called Susser Petroleum Partners L.P., in which Energy Transfer will have an ownership stake. The deal saw the arrival of the Sunoco brand in Texas, where it replaced Valero at the Stripes locations; Stripes and A-Plus remain separate brands. Also in 2014, Sunoco acquired Aloha Petroleum.[17]
In 2015, Sunoco entered into an agreement to purchase MD America operations in east Texas.[16] That same year, Sunoco became a Subway franchisee by opening Subway at the North Midway Service Plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Bedford, Pennsylvania.
Exclusive deals[edit]
In addition to their sponsorship deal with NASCAR, Sunoco also has exclusive deals as the gasoline supplier at the travel plazas along the Ohio Turnpike,[18] Pennsylvania Turnpike,[19] New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway,[20] Atlantic City Expressway,[21] Palisades Parkway, and Delaware Turnpike.[22] Sunoco also operates some of the filling stations on the New York Thruway, as well as the two service areas - Chesapeake House and Maryland House - along Interstate 95 in Maryland.
In addition, Sunoco also owns & operates a station with an A-Plus convenience store at Pittsburgh International Airport, as Sunoco has a very large market share in Pittsburgh. Due to its large presence in Western Pennsylvania, Sunoco is a longtime sponsor of the Pittsburgh Pirates, with an advertisement for Sunoco being present in left field at PNC Park.[23]
Sunoco became the official current fuel supplier of the IZOD IndyCar Series (now the Verizon IndyCar Series) in mid-2010.[24]
Sale of stores to Seven & I Holdings Co.[edit]
On April 4, 2017 Sunoco announced it would sell 1,110 convenience stores to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven,[7] as well as supply 2.2 billion gallons of fuel to 7-Eleven convenience stores annually for 15 years. The company also announced they would be selling 200 more stores to Seven & I by the end of Q4, 2017.
Environmental record[edit]
Sunoco was the only oil company to initially sign the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) principal. However, as of March, 2016, Sunoco is not listed as a Ceres Coalition or Company Network member of Ceres.[25]
In 2000, Sunoco leaked 190,000 gallons of oil into the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania through a cracked pipe. Sunoco's safety systems did not detect the leak, which was reported by a hiker in the Wildlife Refuge.[26]
Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz, for whom the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge is named, was killed on April 4, 1991, when a Sun Company helicopter collided with an airplane carrying the Senator. (Sun Company is the predecessor of Sunoco). That accident also killed two children at the Merion Elementary School playground, into which debris from the two aircraft fell after the collision. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident included poor judgment on the part of the captain of the Sun Company helicopter, and his failure to maintain safe separation from the Senator’s airplane.[27]
As of March, 2016, records maintained by the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) show that Sunoco has experienced 257 hazardous liquids incidents since 2006. (PHMSA defines an "incident" as an event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of liquefied natural gas or gas from an LNG facility that results in a death, or injury necessitating hospitalization; or property damage of $50,000 or more). These 257 incidents resulted in $46,936,215 of property damage. In terms of number of incidents, Sunoco has the worst safety record of 1,518 active pipeline operators who report operating data to PHMSA.[28]
In 2014, Sunoco, along with other defendants, was sued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which alleged that Sunoco and the other defendants polluted the waters of the Commonwealth with MTBE, a gasoline additive. The Commonwealth also alleged that the defendants, including Sunoco, improperly accepted state funding to clean up spills which occurred prior to 1994, and which were therefore not covered by the fund.
As a sponsor[edit]
Sunoco was Penske Racing's sponsor of choice for many years, particularly in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, where Roger Penske's Sunoco Camaros won the championship in 1968 and 1969. Sunoco also sponsored Penske Porsches in the SCCA Can-Am series, and won the Indianapolis 500 in 1972 with Penske and driver Mark Donohue.
In 1989, NASCAR team owner Billy Hagan acquired sponsorship from Sunoco for four seasons. Sterling Marlin drove the #94 Sunoco Ultra94 Oldsmobile during the 1989-90 seasons and Terry Labonte for the 91-92 seasons.
In 2015, Sunoco became the Official Fuel of the NHRA.
In 2016, as part of the Daytona update coinciding with the 2016 Daytona 500, a NASCAR version of the Toyota Camry with Sunoco as its main sponsor appears in Real Racing 3.

Sunoco is an American petroleum and petrochemical manufacturer headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, United States, formerly known as Sun Company Inc. (1886–1920 and 1976–1998) and Sun Oil Co. (1920–1976). Sunoco is one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States, with Sunoco brand gasoline being sold in over 4,700 outlets spanning 26 states,[3] just over a third hosting convenience stores.[4] Since 2012, Sunoco has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, based in Dallas, Texas.
In 2011, it was ranked as the third largest company by revenue in Pennsylvania, after AmerisourceBergen and Comcast.[5] In 2011, the company decided to exit the oil refinery business.[6]
In Canada, the Sunoco brand was licensed for the Ontario retail gas station operations of Suncor Energy until 2010. Following Suncor's acquisition of Petro-Canada, all Canadian Sunoco outlets were converted to Petro-Canada branding.
In 2017, it was announced that 1,110 Sunoco convenience stores would be sold to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven, for $3.3 billion. Also, as a part of the deal, Sunoco also said they would be supplying 2.2 billion gallons of fuel annually for 15 years to 7-Eleven convenience stores.[7]

History[edit]
1800s to 1900s: founding and growth[edit]
The integrated oil company now known as Sunoco began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1886, its partners – Joseph Newton Pew, Philip Pisano and Edward O. Emerson – decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in New Jersey as Sun Company and turned its interest to the new Spindletop field in Texas. Pew's sons, J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew, Jr. would take over the company after their father's death.

With a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries in hand, Sun opened its first service station in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in 1920. The name changed back to Sun Oil Company in 1922 and, in 1925, Sun became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.[8] Sun expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in Sarnia, Ontario, home to a burgeoning new petrochemical industry. Sun established a facility at Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) before the operation was nationalized in 1975.
Custom blending[edit]
Sunoco is perhaps best known to consumers for its "custom blending" pumps, an innovation that, beginning in 1956, allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several octane grades through a single pump.[citation needed] Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of "Custom Blended" gasolines from its "Dial A Grade" pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260,[citation needed] the latter a super-premium grade of 102 octane[citation needed] that was advertised as the "highest octane pump gas"[citation needed] and very popular with operators of V8-powered Muscle Cars of the 1960s.[citation needed]
1960s to 2000s: acquisitions and branding[edit]
In 1967, Sun established its Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited facility in northern Alberta, Canada, to help unlock the estimated 300 billion barrels (48 km3) of recoverable oil in the Athabasca oil sands.
In 1968, Sun Oil merged with Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Sunray DX Oil Company, which refined and marketed gasoline under the DX brand in several midwestern states, and included several refineries including one in Tulsa that was operated by Sun until its sale in June 2009 to Holly Corporation of Dallas.[9] This move expanded Sun's marketing area into the mid-continent region.
Sun Oil continued marketing its petroleum products under both the Sunoco and DX brands through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand and even introduced the high-octane Sunoco ULTRA 94 gasoline to stations in that region, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably Sinclair in Oklahoma.
With increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc., a subsidiary of The Seagram Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion—the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.
Through the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the North Sea and offshore China and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, consumers saw the arrival of Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a major restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of Atlantic Refining and Marketing (and, in effect, that company's convenience store chain, A-Plus), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former Gulf Oil refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from Chevron.
By the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994 Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia Chevron Oil refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. Sun sold its remaining interest in Canada's Suncor Energy in 1995, but markets product from two refineries – one in Toledo, Ohio, and the other Sarnia, Ontario – in joint ventures.[10] In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc. In 2011 the Toledo facility was sold to PBF Energy.
By 1998, Sun had acquired Allied Signal, Inc. chemical plants. Allied Signal, Inc. being on the stock exchange sold half of the company to Honeywell, Inc. and the other half to Sunoco, Inc. The chemical portion of the business was called "Sunoco Chemicals, Inc."
In 2003, the Speedway SuperAmerica chain of gas stations and convenience stores exited the Southeastern United States and sold most of their operations to Sunoco. Shortly prior to this, Sunoco acquired many service stations from Coastal Petroleum, especially its stations in Florida. This has led to the reintroduction of the Sunoco brand to areas it pulled out of ten years earlier. Coincidentally, Speedway would later re-enter the Southeast with its purchase of Hess Corporation's downstream operations in 2014, mirroring that of Sunoco's return to the Southeast.[11]

In 2004, Sunoco replaced ConocoPhillips' 76 brand as the official fuel of NASCAR.
After ConocoPhillips abandoned the marketing of the Mobil brand name in the Washington, DC, area, Sunoco purchased these rights, and has since been converting Maryland and Virginia Mobil stations to the Sunoco brand, bringing the A-Plus convenience store with them – prior to this, these stations had convenience stores under the Circle K or On the Run brands.
In September 2009, Sunoco announced the sale of its retail heating oil and propane distribution business to Superior Plus Corp for $82.5 million in cash.[12]
In October 2009, Sunoco announced it will idle and possibly permanently shut down its Eagle Point/Westville, NJ plant, laying off over 400 employees.
Exit from refinery business[edit]
In December 2010, Sunoco sold its refinery in Toledo, Ohio to PBF Energy for US$400,000,000.[6] Effective 6 September 2011, Sunoco announced that it would exit the crude oil refining business and seek to sell its Philadelphia and Marcus Hook refineries by mid-2012.[6] The company has said that its cost for exiting the refining business could be as high as US$2.7 billion.[6] According to one report, the company had lost some US$800,000,000 on refining operations since 2009;[1] an earlier report provided a figure of US$772,000,000.[6] On December 1, 2011, Sunoco announced it would accelerate closure of the Marcus Hook facility, with a target completion in 90 days.[1] The Marcus Hook facility, founded in 1902 and covering 781 acres, was dedicated exclusively to the processing of light sweet crude oil;[1] this processing focus combined with volatility in crude oil prices are considered contributing factors to both this refinery's closure and Sunoco's exit from the refinery business.[13]
Joint venture with Carlyle Group[edit]
After weeks of negotiations, it was announced that Sunoco would be forming a joint venture with the Carlyle Group, allowing for the continuation of operations at the Philadelphia refinery, and saving over 800 jobs.[14] The joint venture began in late 2012.
Sale to Energy Transfer Partners and merger with Susser Holdings[edit]
In 2012, Dallas-based energy company Energy Transfer Partners purchased Sunoco, making Sunoco a wholly owned subsidiary.[15] As Energy Transfer Partners was more interested in Sunoco's pipeline and refining business that the company was originally planning on exiting, it led to speculation that Energy Transfer Partners would eventually spin-off Sunoco's retail business or sell it outright to a competitor.[16]
In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners announced its purchase of Susser Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Stripes Convenience Stores, and plans on merging it into Sunoco.[16] Upon completion of the merger, Sunoco will be placed into a limited partnership called Susser Petroleum Partners L.P., in which Energy Transfer will have an ownership stake. The deal saw the arrival of the Sunoco brand in Texas, where it replaced Valero at the Stripes locations; Stripes and A-Plus remain separate brands. Also in 2014, Sunoco acquired Aloha Petroleum.[17]
In 2015, Sunoco entered into an agreement to purchase MD America operations in east Texas.[16] That same year, Sunoco became a Subway franchisee by opening Subway at the North Midway Service Plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Bedford, Pennsylvania.
Exclusive deals[edit]
In addition to their sponsorship deal with NASCAR, Sunoco also has exclusive deals as the gasoline supplier at the travel plazas along the Ohio Turnpike,[18] Pennsylvania Turnpike,[19] New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway,[20] Atlantic City Expressway,[21] Palisades Parkway, and Delaware Turnpike.[22] Sunoco also operates some of the filling stations on the New York Thruway, as well as the two service areas - Chesapeake House and Maryland House - along Interstate 95 in Maryland.
In addition, Sunoco also owns & operates a station with an A-Plus convenience store at Pittsburgh International Airport, as Sunoco has a very large market share in Pittsburgh. Due to its large presence in Western Pennsylvania, Sunoco is a longtime sponsor of the Pittsburgh Pirates, with an advertisement for Sunoco being present in left field at PNC Park.[23]
Sunoco became the official current fuel supplier of the IZOD IndyCar Series (now the Verizon IndyCar Series) in mid-2010.[24]
Sale of stores to Seven & I Holdings Co.[edit]
On April 4, 2017 Sunoco announced it would sell 1,110 convenience stores to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven,[7] as well as supply 2.2 billion gallons of fuel to 7-Eleven convenience stores annually for 15 years. The company also announced they would be selling 200 more stores to Seven & I by the end of Q4, 2017.
Environmental record[edit]
Sunoco was the only oil company to initially sign the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) principal. However, as of March, 2016, Sunoco is not listed as a Ceres Coalition or Company Network member of Ceres.[25]
In 2000, Sunoco leaked 190,000 gallons of oil into the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania through a cracked pipe. Sunoco's safety systems did not detect the leak, which was reported by a hiker in the Wildlife Refuge.[26]
Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz, for whom the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge is named, was killed on April 4, 1991, when a Sun Company helicopter collided with an airplane carrying the Senator. (Sun Company is the predecessor of Sunoco). That accident also killed two children at the Merion Elementary School playground, into which debris from the two aircraft fell after the collision. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident included poor judgment on the part of the captain of the Sun Company helicopter, and his failure to maintain safe separation from the Senator’s airplane.[27]
As of March, 2016, records maintained by the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) show that Sunoco has experienced 257 hazardous liquids incidents since 2006. (PHMSA defines an "incident" as an event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of liquefied natural gas or gas from an LNG facility that results in a death, or injury necessitating hospitalization; or property damage of $50,000 or more). These 257 incidents resulted in $46,936,215 of property damage. In terms of number of incidents, Sunoco has the worst safety record of 1,518 active pipeline operators who report operating data to PHMSA.[28]
In 2014, Sunoco, along with other defendants, was sued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which alleged that Sunoco and the other defendants polluted the waters of the Commonwealth with MTBE, a gasoline additive. The Commonwealth also alleged that the defendants, including Sunoco, improperly accepted state funding to clean up spills which occurred prior to 1994, and which were therefore not covered by the fund.
As a sponsor[edit]
Sunoco was Penske Racing's sponsor of choice for many years, particularly in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, where Roger Penske's Sunoco Camaros won the championship in 1968 and 1969. Sunoco also sponsored Penske Porsches in the SCCA Can-Am series, and won the Indianapolis 500 in 1972 with Penske and driver Mark Donohue.
In 1989, NASCAR team owner Billy Hagan acquired sponsorship from Sunoco for four seasons. Sterling Marlin drove the #94 Sunoco Ultra94 Oldsmobile during the 1989-90 seasons and Terry Labonte for the 91-92 seasons.
In 2015, Sunoco became the Official Fuel of the NHRA.
In 2016, as part of the Daytona update coinciding with the 2016 Daytona 500, a NASCAR version of the Toyota Camry with Sunoco as its main sponsor appears in Real Racing 3.

Sunoco is an American petroleum and petrochemical manufacturer headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, United States, formerly known as Sun Company Inc. (1886–1920 and 1976–1998) and Sun Oil Co. (1920–1976). Sunoco is one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States, with Sunoco brand gasoline being sold in over 4,700 outlets spanning 26 states,[3] just over a third hosting convenience stores.[4] Since 2012, Sunoco has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, based in Dallas, Texas.
In 2011, it was ranked as the third largest company by revenue in Pennsylvania, after AmerisourceBergen and Comcast.[5] In 2011, the company decided to exit the oil refinery business.[6]
In Canada, the Sunoco brand was licensed for the Ontario retail gas station operations of Suncor Energy until 2010. Following Suncor's acquisition of Petro-Canada, all Canadian Sunoco outlets were converted to Petro-Canada branding.
In 2017, it was announced that 1,110 Sunoco convenience stores would be sold to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven, for $3.3 billion. Also, as a part of the deal, Sunoco also said they would be supplying 2.2 billion gallons of fuel annually for 15 years to 7-Eleven convenience stores.[7]

History[edit]
1800s to 1900s: founding and growth[edit]
The integrated oil company now known as Sunoco began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1886, its partners – Joseph Newton Pew, Philip Pisano and Edward O. Emerson – decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in New Jersey as Sun Company and turned its interest to the new Spindletop field in Texas. Pew's sons, J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew, Jr. would take over the company after their father's death.

With a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries in hand, Sun opened its first service station in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in 1920. The name changed back to Sun Oil Company in 1922 and, in 1925, Sun became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.[8] Sun expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in Sarnia, Ontario, home to a burgeoning new petrochemical industry. Sun established a facility at Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) before the operation was nationalized in 1975.
Custom blending[edit]
Sunoco is perhaps best known to consumers for its "custom blending" pumps, an innovation that, beginning in 1956, allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several octane grades through a single pump.[citation needed] Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of "Custom Blended" gasolines from its "Dial A Grade" pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260,[citation needed] the latter a super-premium grade of 102 octane[citation needed] that was advertised as the "highest octane pump gas"[citation needed] and very popular with operators of V8-powered Muscle Cars of the 1960s.[citation needed]
1960s to 2000s: acquisitions and branding[edit]
In 1967, Sun established its Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited facility in northern Alberta, Canada, to help unlock the estimated 300 billion barrels (48 km3) of recoverable oil in the Athabasca oil sands.
In 1968, Sun Oil merged with Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Sunray DX Oil Company, which refined and marketed gasoline under the DX brand in several midwestern states, and included several refineries including one in Tulsa that was operated by Sun until its sale in June 2009 to Holly Corporation of Dallas.[9] This move expanded Sun's marketing area into the mid-continent region.
Sun Oil continued marketing its petroleum products under both the Sunoco and DX brands through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand and even introduced the high-octane Sunoco ULTRA 94 gasoline to stations in that region, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably Sinclair in Oklahoma.
With increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc., a subsidiary of The Seagram Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion—the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.
Through the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the North Sea and offshore China and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, consumers saw the arrival of Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a major restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of Atlantic Refining and Marketing (and, in effect, that company's convenience store chain, A-Plus), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former Gulf Oil refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from Chevron.
By the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994 Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia Chevron Oil refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. Sun sold its remaining interest in Canada's Suncor Energy in 1995, but markets product from two refineries – one in Toledo, Ohio, and the other Sarnia, Ontario – in joint ventures.[10] In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc. In 2011 the Toledo facility was sold to PBF Energy.
By 1998, Sun had acquired Allied Signal, Inc. chemical plants. Allied Signal, Inc. being on the stock exchange sold half of the company to Honeywell, Inc. and the other half to Sunoco, Inc. The chemical portion of the business was called "Sunoco Chemicals, Inc."
In 2003, the Speedway SuperAmerica chain of gas stations and convenience stores exited the Southeastern United States and sold most of their operations to Sunoco. Shortly prior to this, Sunoco acquired many service stations from Coastal Petroleum, especially its stations in Florida. This has led to the reintroduction of the Sunoco brand to areas it pulled out of ten years earlier. Coincidentally, Speedway would later re-enter the Southeast with its purchase of Hess Corporation's downstream operations in 2014, mirroring that of Sunoco's return to the Southeast.[11]

In 2004, Sunoco replaced ConocoPhillips' 76 brand as the official fuel of NASCAR.
After ConocoPhillips abandoned the marketing of the Mobil brand name in the Washington, DC, area, Sunoco purchased these rights, and has since been converting Maryland and Virginia Mobil stations to the Sunoco brand, bringing the A-Plus convenience store with them – prior to this, these stations had convenience stores under the Circle K or On the Run brands.
In September 2009, Sunoco announced the sale of its retail heating oil and propane distribution business to Superior Plus Corp for $82.5 million in cash.[12]
In October 2009, Sunoco announced it will idle and possibly permanently shut down its Eagle Point/Westville, NJ plant, laying off over 400 employees.
Exit from refinery business[edit]
In December 2010, Sunoco sold its refinery in Toledo, Ohio to PBF Energy for US$400,000,000.[6] Effective 6 September 2011, Sunoco announced that it would exit the crude oil refining business and seek to sell its Philadelphia and Marcus Hook refineries by mid-2012.[6] The company has said that its cost for exiting the refining business could be as high as US$2.7 billion.[6] According to one report, the company had lost some US$800,000,000 on refining operations since 2009;[1] an earlier report provided a figure of US$772,000,000.[6] On December 1, 2011, Sunoco announced it would accelerate closure of the Marcus Hook facility, with a target completion in 90 days.[1] The Marcus Hook facility, founded in 1902 and covering 781 acres, was dedicated exclusively to the processing of light sweet crude oil;[1] this processing focus combined with volatility in crude oil prices are considered contributing factors to both this refinery's closure and Sunoco's exit from the refinery business.[13]
Joint venture with Carlyle Group[edit]
After weeks of negotiations, it was announced that Sunoco would be forming a joint venture with the Carlyle Group, allowing for the continuation of operations at the Philadelphia refinery, and saving over 800 jobs.[14] The joint venture began in late 2012.
Sale to Energy Transfer Partners and merger with Susser Holdings[edit]
In 2012, Dallas-based energy company Energy Transfer Partners purchased Sunoco, making Sunoco a wholly owned subsidiary.[15] As Energy Transfer Partners was more interested in Sunoco's pipeline and refining business that the company was originally planning on exiting, it led to speculation that Energy Transfer Partners would eventually spin-off Sunoco's retail business or sell it outright to a competitor.[16]
In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners announced its purchase of Susser Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Stripes Convenience Stores, and plans on merging it into Sunoco.[16] Upon completion of the merger, Sunoco will be placed into a limited partnership called Susser Petroleum Partners L.P., in which Energy Transfer will have an ownership stake. The deal saw the arrival of the Sunoco brand in Texas, where it replaced Valero at the Stripes locations; Stripes and A-Plus remain separate brands. Also in 2014, Sunoco acquired Aloha Petroleum.[17]
In 2015, Sunoco entered into an agreement to purchase MD America operations in east Texas.[16] That same year, Sunoco became a Subway franchisee by opening Subway at the North Midway Service Plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Bedford, Pennsylvania.
Exclusive deals[edit]
In addition to their sponsorship deal with NASCAR, Sunoco also has exclusive deals as the gasoline supplier at the travel plazas along the Ohio Turnpike,[18] Pennsylvania Turnpike,[19] New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway,[20] Atlantic City Expressway,[21] Palisades Parkway, and Delaware Turnpike.[22] Sunoco also operates some of the filling stations on the New York Thruway, as well as the two service areas - Chesapeake House and Maryland House - along Interstate 95 in Maryland.
In addition, Sunoco also owns & operates a station with an A-Plus convenience store at Pittsburgh International Airport, as Sunoco has a very large market share in Pittsburgh. Due to its large presence in Western Pennsylvania, Sunoco is a longtime sponsor of the Pittsburgh Pirates, with an advertisement for Sunoco being present in left field at PNC Park.[23]
Sunoco became the official current fuel supplier of the IZOD IndyCar Series (now the Verizon IndyCar Series) in mid-2010.[24]
Sale of stores to Seven & I Holdings Co.[edit]
On April 4, 2017 Sunoco announced it would sell 1,110 convenience stores to Seven & I Holdings Co., parent company of 7-Eleven,[7] as well as supply 2.2 billion gallons of fuel to 7-Eleven convenience stores annually for 15 years. The company also announced they would be selling 200 more stores to Seven & I by the end of Q4, 2017.
Environmental record[edit]
Sunoco was the only oil company to initially sign the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) principal. However, as of March, 2016, Sunoco is not listed as a Ceres Coalition or Company Network member of Ceres.[25]
In 2000, Sunoco leaked 190,000 gallons of oil into the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania through a cracked pipe. Sunoco's safety systems did not detect the leak, which was reported by a hiker in the Wildlife Refuge.[26]
Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz, for whom the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge is named, was killed on April 4, 1991, when a Sun Company helicopter collided with an airplane carrying the Senator. (Sun Company is the predecessor of Sunoco). That accident also killed two children at the Merion Elementary School playground, into which debris from the two aircraft fell after the collision. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident included poor judgment on the part of the captain of the Sun Company helicopter, and his failure to maintain safe separation from the Senator’s airplane.[27]
As of March, 2016, records maintained by the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) show that Sunoco has experienced 257 hazardous liquids incidents since 2006. (PHMSA defines an "incident" as an event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of liquefied natural gas or gas from an LNG facility that results in a death, or injury necessitating hospitalization; or property damage of $50,000 or more). These 257 incidents resulted in $46,936,215 of property damage. In terms of number of incidents, Sunoco has the worst safety record of 1,518 active pipeline operators who report operating data to PHMSA.[28]
In 2014, Sunoco, along with other defendants, was sued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which alleged that Sunoco and the other defendants polluted the waters of the Commonwealth with MTBE, a gasoline additive. The Commonwealth also alleged that the defendants, including Sunoco, improperly accepted state funding to clean up spills which occurred prior to 1994, and which were therefore not covered by the fund.
As a sponsor[edit]
Sunoco was Penske Racing's sponsor of choice for many years, particularly in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, where Roger Penske's Sunoco Camaros won the championship in 1968 and 1969. Sunoco also sponsored Penske Porsches in the SCCA Can-Am series, and won the Indianapolis 500 in 1972 with Penske and driver Mark Donohue.
In 1989, NASCAR team owner Billy Hagan acquired sponsorship from Sunoco for four seasons. Sterling Marlin drove the #94 Sunoco Ultra94 Oldsmobile during the 1989-90 seasons and Terry Labonte for the 91-92 seasons.
In 2015, Sunoco became the Official Fuel of the NHRA.
In 2016, as part of the Daytona update coinciding with the 2016 Daytona 500, a NASCAR version of the Toyota Camry with Sunoco as its main sponsor appears in Real Racing 3.
