Company history[edit]




Rick Alden donating to Boarding for Breast Cancer charity in 2007


Skullcandy was founded by Rick Alden in 2003. The first Skullcandy product, the Skullcandy Portable Link, was introduced at the 2003 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The LINK system combines headphones with hands-free cellular technology, allowing users to listen to music from a portable audio device, while making and receiving calls through their cell phone. Skullcandy holds a patent for the wireless version of LINK technology.[5]
In December 2008, Skullcandy products were described as "the world's coolest ear bud," by Fortune magazine.[6]
In April 2011, Skullcandy purchased headphones manufacturer Astro Studios (Astro Gaming) for an unknown amount of cash.
On January 28, 2011, Skullcandy filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[7] This announcement was met with some criticism from financial press.[8][9]
On June 24, 2016, Incipio, a maker of phone cases, wireless speakers, and other accessories announced plans to acquire Skullcandy for $177 million, however the deal later fell through as Incipio refused to submit a proposed amendment to the merger agreement and Skullcandy terminated the agreement.[10] Skullcandy considered numerous other offers, eventually agreeing to be acquired by Mill Road Capital for $196.9 million at $6.35 per share. The deal was finalized and completed on October 3rd, 2016, and the company became a private business again.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

This expansion of the Crusher family includes a proprietary built-in amplifier that powers both audio and stereo immersion drivers, enabling a dual-sensory and dual-channel bass experience.

Skullcandy Inc. is a Park City, Utah-based company that markets headphones, earphones, hands free devices, audio backpacks, MP3 players, and other products.[2]

Products[edit]
Skullcandy's products are targeted at the outdoor action sports demographic (snowboarders, skateboarders, etc.) and general consumer market.[3] Skullcandy products are sold through retailers, specialty outlets, corporate incentive programs and the company's online store.[4]
Company history[edit]




Rick Alden donating to Boarding for Breast Cancer charity in 2007


Skullcandy was founded by Rick Alden in 2003. The first Skullcandy product, the Skullcandy Portable Link, was introduced at the 2003 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The LINK system combines headphones with hands-free cellular technology, allowing users to listen to music from a portable audio device, while making and receiving calls through their cell phone. Skullcandy holds a patent for the wireless version of LINK technology.[5]
In December 2008, Skullcandy products were described as "the world's coolest ear bud," by Fortune magazine.[6]
In April 2011, Skullcandy purchased headphones manufacturer Astro Studios (Astro Gaming) for an unknown amount of cash.
On January 28, 2011, Skullcandy filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[7] This announcement was met with some criticism from financial press.[8][9]
On June 24, 2016, Incipio, a maker of phone cases, wireless speakers, and other accessories announced plans to acquire Skullcandy for $177 million, however the deal later fell through as Incipio refused to submit a proposed amendment to the merger agreement and Skullcandy terminated the agreement.[10] Skullcandy considered numerous other offers, eventually agreeing to be acquired by Mill Road Capital for $196.9 million at $6.35 per share. The deal was finalized and completed on October 3rd, 2016, and the company became a private business again.[11]

Company history[edit]




Rick Alden donating to Boarding for Breast Cancer charity in 2007


Skullcandy was founded by Rick Alden in 2003. The first Skullcandy product, the Skullcandy Portable Link, was introduced at the 2003 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The LINK system combines headphones with hands-free cellular technology, allowing users to listen to music from a portable audio device, while making and receiving calls through their cell phone. Skullcandy holds a patent for the wireless version of LINK technology.[5]
In December 2008, Skullcandy products were described as "the world's coolest ear bud," by Fortune magazine.[6]
In April 2011, Skullcandy purchased headphones manufacturer Astro Studios (Astro Gaming) for an unknown amount of cash.
On January 28, 2011, Skullcandy filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[7] This announcement was met with some criticism from financial press.[8][9]
On June 24, 2016, Incipio, a maker of phone cases, wireless speakers, and other accessories announced plans to acquire Skullcandy for $177 million, however the deal later fell through as Incipio refused to submit a proposed amendment to the merger agreement and Skullcandy terminated the agreement.[10] Skullcandy considered numerous other offers, eventually agreeing to be acquired by Mill Road Capital for $196.9 million at $6.35 per share. The deal was finalized and completed on October 3rd, 2016, and the company became a private business again.[11]

Skullcandy, Inc. to Align Product, Marketing and Sales Functions
Announces Executive Changes and Commences Search for Chief Financial Officer

PARK CITY, Utah, June 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skullcandy, Inc. (Nasdaq:SKUL) today announced the Company is taking significant steps to better align its product, marketing and sales functions in order to strengthen its position as the leading performance and lifestyle audio company driven by the creativity and attitude of youth culture. The Company also announced certain executive changes and the commencement of a search for a new Chief Financial Officer.


 As part of the process, the Company is relocating its marketing, creative, business development and legal departments, as well as certain sales and international personnel to its headquarters in Park City, Utah, and will close the office in San Clemente, California, which has historically housed significant portions of these functions. 

Hoby Darling, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, "Bringing together our teams in Park City will allow us to better focus our go to market process and ensure that our products, messaging and distribution are aligned with our target consumer. It will be fantastic to have these three critical functions collaborating under one roof and represents an important step toward executing our overall long-term strategic plan. It will also enhance our ability to attract top talent and build an even stronger culture, as we look to be one of the most desirable employers in the audio and youth culture segment. With three world-class mountain resorts, hundreds of miles of trails and significant technology and creative influences, Park City 
provides us a fantastic base that is rooted in our authenticity as an active and creative brand born on the mountains and in skate parks."


 The Company expects to record an associated pre-tax, restructuring charge in the range of $3.0 million to $3.8 million, of which $500 thousand to $1 million is estimated to be incurred in the second quarter of 2013. The Company has approximately 30 employees in San Clemente, the majority of whom will be given the opportunity to relocate with the Company's assistance and continue working in the Park City office. The Company plans to begin implementing the proposed changes this summer and expects the moves to be complete by early fall to minimize any business disruption. 

Executive Changes


 The Company also announced that Sam Paschel, currently Executive Vice President of Product Development and Merchandising has been promoted to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer, where he will oversee the operations of both the product and demand creation teams.

Mr. Darling commented, "Since joining Skullcandy last September Sam has had a very positive impact on improving our product development strategy and spearheading changes in merchandising so we can better excite and serve our consumer. As we bring our product, marketing and sales teams together in Park City, I'm confident Sam is the right person to oversee further alignment of our product, merchandising and demand creation efforts."


 The Company also announced that it has commenced a search for a new Chief Financial Officer following Kyle Wescoat's decision to resign in order to pursue opportunities closer to his home in Southern California. Mr. Wescoat will remain with the Company through approximately September 2013 while it searches for his successor.


 "I want to thank Kyle for his efforts during this period in the Company's history," said Mr. Darling. "He has been a trusted asset during my first few months on the job and I'll continue to rely on his financial acumen and leadership to ensure a smooth transition and help improve upon our recent performance."

About SkullcandySkullcandy coupons discount headphones, MP3 docks, and Bluetooth gear that combine these technologies in inventive, design-focused ways.

Limited-edition lines, and partnerships with designers and athletes keep inventory fresh, whether that means some Paul Frank whimsy or some Eric Koston snakeskin.

To get your hands on a pair of these sublime headphones snatch a Skullcandy coupon from below.Rick Alden founded Skullcandy in Park City, Utah, home not only to the Sundance Film Festival but to the training centers of myriad professional winter sports. Over the years, Skullcandy has continued to draw inspiration—and fans—from those in action sports communities. Alden started the brand in 2003, and before the year was over, Skullcandy earpieces were garnering double-takes at the International Consumer Electronics Show. Since then, Skullcandy's crisp sound, sharp design, and specialty specs have only won more enthusiasts.Headphones bear hundreds of different designs—color, shape, and purpose all vary. Trendy graphic patterns, translucent panels, team logos, and, of course, the brand's iconic skull all sing in candy colors. Headphone structure varies greatly, too—some are chunky and classic, some are swathed in textured leather, and some boast lithe gold panels joining oblong earpieces. There are headphones designed specifically for DJs, pilots, and gamers. Earbuds, too, charm with bright color combinations, clear see-through chambers, meticulous patterns, and unexpected architecture. Skullcandy coupon codes can lead to something perfect for any personality.
