          Shade Cloth-Screen  
   Shade Cloth is one of our most versatile products. You will find it an essential part of your greenhouse if you plan on growing through the summer months. It helps cut down on the temperature tremendously, keeping your greenhouse functional.  You will find our knitted Shade Cloth dependable and tough as nails, resisting break down and brittleness over time, unlike other brands. Featuring tough, lock-stitch construction and taped binding with a seat-belt like material, at no extra charge, grommets are also placed every 2 feet around the perimeter of your cloth. Most customers have found they can get a lifespan of 10-15 years out of their cloth as long as it is removed during the winter months.  You can use Shade Cloth on Greenhouses, Fences, Canopies, virtually anything you need to provide shade for. It can also be used for trellises, porches, livestock pens, and boats, the possibilities are endless. Choose from a variety of colors and percentages of shade. Feel free to use our custom Shade Cloth Calculator to create a customized fit for your project! Our shade cloth calculator is a convenient on-line option if you require a non-standard size or a change in the grommets and/or edges. There are no hidden charges for grommets, binding, fabrication, or custom sizes.  For most hoop houses, use Black, White or Aluminet in percentages of 50% and under to provide relief from too much sun and heat. Using Shade Cloth with Roll-up Side and/or automated ventilation will make a drastic difference for your plants, saving them from burning up in the heat.  For privacy and windbreaks, you can use percentages of 70% and higher in your choice of colors.  Some pieces may include a factory seam, depending on the width. Please contact us if you have questions regarding this possibility. Features of Our Shade Cloth:  Better Ventilation and Water Permeable: Open lock stitch design reduces wind speed and heat buildup in structure Lightweight and Easy to Install: 20-25% lighter than woven shade cloth with dramatically more strength. Can be cut on site and will not ravel UV Protection: UV resistant, high density polyethylene. Crop protection for UV and heat sensitive plants Wide Widths: Available up to 34 feet Chemical Resistant: Resists most horticultural chemicals, sprays, and detergents Reduce Soil Moisture Loss: Less evaporation Tough Lock Stitch Knitted Construction: Resists rips, tears, and fraying. Shade levels remain constant during product life Cost Effective: No edge taping and minimal sewing required thanks to knitted lock stitch

       Description  
Our quality shade fabrics are manufactured featuring tough, lock-stitch construction.
We beat most shade cloth distributors prices by 25%. Not sure what percentage of shade cloth you need, have more questions, or need help? Contact us!
Our shade cloth comes standard with sewn black binding edges (a durable seatbelt-like material) and grommets every 2 feet.
With pieces 100 square feet or larger, we advise providing support cables underneath to prevent sagging. Lightweight cable can be run from corner to corner, providing an X for the shade cloth to rest on. For pieces over 400 square feet, lightweight cables running end to end every 4 feet is advised.
Custom orders (including all Shade Cloth) cannot be returned and are not refundable. Please check to make sure the sizes you need are correct before placing the order.
Features:

Better Ventilation and Water Permeable: Open lock stitch design reduces wind speed and heat buildup in structure
Lightweight and Easy to Install: 20-25% lighter than woven shade cloth with dramatically more strength.  Can be cut on site and will not ravel
UV Protection: UV resistant, high density polyethylene.  Crop protection for UV and heat sensitive plants
Wide Widths: Available up to 34 feet
Chemical Resistant: Resists most horticultural chemicals, sprays, and detergents
Reduce Soil Moisture Loss: Less evaporation
Tough Lock Stitch Knitted Construction: Resists rips, tears, and fraying. Shade levels remain constant during product life
Cost Effective: No edge taping and minimal sewing required thanks to knitted lock stitch

  	Love the sun shade to top off my recently built 10 x 14 pergola.
Perfect fit, the 1 ft spacing on the edge for the eyelets, worked perfectly with the
shock cord I bought to string around it and secure to the pergola.
My only complaint would be that it took 3 weeks to get it done and shipped. BUt would definitely
purchase from these folks again!   Verified Buyer  Recommended            light tan fabric for sun shade              5 out of 5      Location:   Date: July 20, 2017

  	We have been getting our shade cloths from you for years and they are always well made and keep us cooler in the shade.  When the sun is blazing and 100+ degrees that 10 degrees difference and shade coming out of the pool makes life bearable in the Texas heat.   Verified Buyer  Recommended            Shady garden              5 out of 5   Richard  Location: New Mexico  Date: July 11, 2017

  	Quality seems very good now that we've received the order with the grommets (manufacturer's mistake in sending 1st order without them - sales staff was excellent in their immediate response and replacement). We ordered the 40% shade -- seemed more sheer than we expected, but it is helping save our berries in the extreme heat wave we're having.   Verified Buyer  Recommended            Oh yeah              5 out of 5   Oldpepsiman  Location: Thatcher,az  Date: June 19, 2017
