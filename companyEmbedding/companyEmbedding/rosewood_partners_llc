Rosewood Partners close on land for lifestyle center
By Heidi Cenac – Anderson Independent MailThursday, January 11, 2007
ANDERSON COUNTY — Imagine pulling out from Interstate Boulevard. Instead of facing a large, white house surrounded by trees, there are shoppers bustling down a landscaped walkway and couples dining in a sidewalk café.
Creating a retail village is the concept behind the estimated $50 million development Rosewood Partners LLC is planning for 60.59 acres at Interstate 85 and U.S. 76, an area commonly known as the Sally Rose estate.
Rosewood Partners closed on the land Wednesday, but the project was first announced in December. Ned Pettigrew, managing general partner of Rosewood Partners, said the group started work last year on the anticipated 500,000-square-foot lifestyle center, currently referred to as Rosewood Mall.
According to the Urban Land Institute, a lifestyle center is an open-air development with high-quality architecture often resembling a downtown. The developments focus on specific retail sectors and include several commercial uses, typical of a traditional Main Street.
Rosewood Mall will be the first development of its kind in the Upstate, similar to Mt. Pleasant Towne Center in Mt. Pleasant and The Streets of Toringdon in Charlotte, N.C.
Anderson County Council Member Bill McAbee said District 4 and all of Anderson County should benefit from the development, which will bring additional tax revenue to the schools. Retail experts agreed that the project could have a positive impact on Anderson’s residents and retailers.
There are close to 160 lifestyle centers in the United States. They typically attract upscale, national retailers and high-income shoppers, said Patrice Duker, a spokeswoman for the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Lifestyle centers complement existing retail instead of competing with it, Ms. Duker said.
“The lifestyle center will bring so many more retailers to that area without increasing the target market. It’s a good thing,” said Marianne Bickle, who chairs the Department of Retailing at the University of South Carolina’s College of Hospitality, Retail and Sports Management.
Property values for existing retailers and residents will likely increase as a result of the development, Ms. Bickle said.
The Sally Rose estate was the perfect site for several reasons, Mr. Pettigrew said. It’s a pin corner on I-85 with significant frontage, side access and entrance options. The site will pull from the Anderson and Clemson areas, which Mr. Pettigrew expects to grow as retirees move toward the mountains and around Hartwell Lake.
The construction of a new elementary school near Pendleton and Clemson developer Tom Winkopp’s interest in the former WestPoint Stevens plant site are both signs that the area is growing, he said.
Rosewood Partners will spend six months to a year planning the development before residents start to see construction. The partnership also is acquiring additional property in the same vicinity for this or future projects, Mr. Pettigrew said.
Once complete, the lifestyle center could add around 1,000 jobs.
Wood and Partners of Hilton Head Island and Atlanta will serve as the project’s land planners and lead firm.
Other South Carolina firms involved in the project include Davis and Floyd of Greenwood and Greenville, Newkirk Environmental Inc. of Charleston and local surveyor Samuel B. Glenn Jr. from Anderson.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/30/2012
            

                BBB has determined that Rosewood Partners, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
