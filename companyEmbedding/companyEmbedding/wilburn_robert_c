About the Wilburn Group

		Founded in 2009, the Wilburn Group is a collection of individuals with a very high caliber of
		experience in the non-profit, corporate and government arenas.
	

		The group is led by Dr. Robert C. Wilburn, who, in his distinguished career, has served as the
		President and CEO of the Gettysburg Foundation, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and the Carnegie
		Institute in Pittsburgh; President of Indiana University of Pennsylvania; and Pennsylvania's Secretary
		of Education.
		See Dr. Wilburn's full biography.



Robert C. Wilburn

			Robert Wilburn has served as the Chief Executive Officer in five very different environments over the past 30 years.
			Under his leadership, the number of customers, members, donors and volunteers increased sharply within each organization,
			bringing with them a greater sense of commitment and participation.
		

			In July 2009, Dr. Wilburn was named a Distinguished Service Professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College
			in Washington, DC. In this role, he helps advanced graduate students better understand the interaction between
			theory and practice in the public sphere.
From August 2000 until July 2009, Dr. Wilburn served as President and CEO of the new Gettysburg Foundation.
		  This non-profit organization forged a public-private partnership with the National Park Service to restore,
		  preserve and articulate to the nation the meaning of Gettysburg—site of the decisive Civil War battle and
		  Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The success of this partnership has become a model within the government
		  and non-profit communities.
	  

			When he served as President and CEO of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, an organization of some 3,500
			employees with an operating budget of $192 million, Dr. Wilburn moved this venerable institution in new
			directions. In addition to reversing a decline in attendance and finances through innovative and interactive
			on-site programming, he guided Colonial Williamsburg into the 21st century by reaching out into classrooms
			across the country with live, interactive broadcasts to millions of students in all 50 states. A very popular
			website and an intensive training program for teachers complemented these efforts. Donors responded to these
			changes and to an award-winning marketing campaign by doubling their support and enabling a successful $500
		million campaign. 

			While at Gettysburg and especially at Colonial Williamsburg, Dr. Wilburn, together with his wife Pat, organized
			and hosted numerous dinners, meetings, conferences and events for royalty, current and former heads of state
			from all parts of the world, including four US Presidents, foreign ministers, ambassadors, governors, senators,
			business leaders and major donors.
		

			Dr. Wilburn served as President and CEO of the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, PA from 1984 until 1992. Another
			distinguished institution, which for many years had stagnant attendance and membership, became alive by embracing
			Andrew Carnegie's vision that Art, Music, Science and Literature—represented by the four institutions that comprise
			the Carnegie Institute—could perform together as a “noble quartet.” Under Dr. Wilburn's guidance, membership tripled,
			attendance increased sharply and donations soared, as the community became part of the new vision.
		

			Dr. Wilburn takes particular pride in two events that occurred during his tenure at the Carnegie Institute that
			changed the cultural landscape of Pittsburgh. First, the Buhl Science Center merged with the Carnegie Institute
			and a new $40 million Carnegie Science Center was built on the Allegheny River. Second, he led the founding of
			the Andy Warhol Museum by negotiating the gift of more than 1,000 paintings and drawings from the Warhol and Dia
			Art Foundations, and by raising the money to secure and renovate an historic seven-story building in downtown
			Pittsburgh for their display. In addition to the funds raised for the Warhol Museum, Dr. Wilburn led a successful
			$125 million Capital Campaign. In recognition of these accomplishments, the Vectors selected him as the “Man of
			the Year” in Pittsburgh in 1991.
		

			Prior to the Carnegie Institute, Dr. Wilburn served as a cabinet member for six years for Pennsylvania Governor
			Dick Thornburgh, first as Secretary of Budget and Administration and later as Secretary of Education. In addition
			to successfully negotiating contracts with each of 23 unions, he directed the creation and adoption of four
			consecutive balanced budgets with no tax increases, the first time that this had been accomplished since World
			War II. As Secretary of Education, he shepherded the implementation of the newly legislated State System of Higher
			Education, which he had helped shape as Secretary of Budget and Administration. High school graduation requirements
			were revised and significantly enhanced. This was the first major curriculum reform in 25 years. Teacher training
			standards were increased and the first statewide assessment system for students was put in place.
		

			Governor Thornburgh tapped Dr. Wilburn for service in his Cabinet as a result of his accomplishments and reputation
			at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Assuming the university's presidency during serious labor strife that was
			reflected in a myriad of legal actions, he calmed the waters and enabled a burst of programs and facility expansion
			that had been frustrated by the years of labor problems. He also launched the first private fundraising campaign in
			the university's history: a campaign to preserve John Sutton Hall, a century-old structure that was—and is today—the
			heart of the campus.
		

			To become President of IUP, Dr. Wilburn left a successful career in banking where he had held several positions at
			Chase Manhattan Bank, including Executive Director of the Asset Liability Management Committee. Prior to that, he
			held positions in the Defense Department and the White House working on policy development, most notably the legislation
			creating the all-volunteer armed forces.
		

			Dr. Wilburn received his education at the United States Air Force Academy, earning a BS in Economics and Engineering;
			and at Princeton University where he earned Masters and PhD Degrees in Economics and Public Affairs.
		

			Along with serving on more than two dozen non-profit boards and government boards and commissions, Dr. Wilburn also
			has more than 50 years of cumulative experience serving on corporate boards. He is currently on the Board of Directors
			at Harsco Corporation and Erie Insurance Company, and has served on the boards of Dravo Corporation and Crestar Financial Corporation.

Medal of Honor Museum Foundation Enters Design Phase; Announces Architect, Exhibit Team for New Museum

Oct 21, 2014, 06:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation 











 
















































 

 




















 


MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C., Oct. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- With the architectural and exhibit teams now on board, the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation has moved into the conceptual design phase for a new museum and education center at Patriots Point.
Safdie Architects of Boston, MA, and Gallagher & Associates museum planning and design, of Silver Spring, MD, are officially on board and have begun an intensive four-month process that will culminate with renderings of the building and exhibits, a building model and a short film detailing the design concepts.  
"This marks an important milestone in our timeline for the new National Medal of Honor Museum," said Robert C. Wilburn, president and CEO of the Museum Foundation.  "At the end of this phase, we will have a good idea of what the building and exhibits will look like.  We will be able to answer questions in greater detail and will have visuals that express the mission of the new museum to potential donors."
Last spring, the Museum Foundation reached out to leading architect and museum planning and design firms across the country.  Virtually all of them – 23 architectural firms and 16 exhibit design firms -- expressed an interest in the project by responding to a request for qualifications.  The quality of the submissions made the selection process challenging and time-consuming, Wilburn said, noting that the Museum Foundation wanted to identify a team that would work well together.
Led by the celebrated architect Moshe Safdie, Safdie Architects' notable museum projects include the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, AR; Khalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum of the Sikh people in India; the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Canada; and the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, Israel, among others.  The firm was chosen for its creativity, the unique nature of every building it designs, and its skill in working with waterfront sites, Wilburn said.  The new museum and education center will be on the east side of Charleston Harbor.
Gallagher & Associates' work includes the National World War II Museum in New Orleans; the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California; the Museum and Visitor Center at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania; and the Normandy American Cemetery Visitor Center in France.  "Our goal is an informative, inspiring – even transformative – visitor experience," Wilburn said.
The National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation is a non-profit educational organization established to preserve and present the stories of the nation's Medal of Honor recipients; to help visitors understand what it means to put service above self; and to inspire current and future generations about the Medal's ideals of patriotism, leadership and courage. This will be the only museum in the country that brings together the story of the nation's highest military honor, all of its recipi­ents, and the wars in which they fought.  
About Moshe Safdie and Safdie Architects 
Moshe Safdie is an architect, urban planner, educator, theorist, and author who embraces a comprehensive and humane design philosophy. In keeping with a philosophical approach that Safdie has applied around the world for more than four decades, the design of each of his projects is responsive to local historic, cultural, and environmental contexts and grows out of a vision of the way it can affect the lives of the individuals for whom the buildings and public spaces are created. The firm has designed and realized a wide range of projects around the world, including cultural, civic, and educational institutions; mixed-use urban centers and airports; and master plans for existing neighborhoods and entirely new cities, many of which have become landmarks in their communities.
Notable projects include Habitat '67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort and ArtScience Museum in Singapore; the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.; and the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri. Safdie Architects is based in Boston with offices in Toronto, Jerusalem, Singapore and Shanghai.
About Gallagher & Associates
As president and founder of Gallagher & Associates, Patrick Gallagher has led the design of some of the world's most memorable museum experiences, from his long-standing relationship with the Smithsonian Institution, to high-profile projects in Asia and Europe. Under his guidance, the firm has gained international acclaim for its leadership in the field of museum planning and experience design.  The firm's collective portfolio is extremely diverse and often flows from the creation of an interpretive and economic master plan, to full service renovation and finally, to complete ground up building projects. We guide our clients not only in the initial visioning of a particular project; we also assist in operations planning, strategic planning, and lifecycle planning. The firm has extensive expertise in creating experiences that promote regional tourism, link tourism and instigate urban redevelopment. Our interdisciplinary teams combine thorough research, thoughtful master planning and design, media programming, and dynamic environmental graphics.
Gallagher & Associates has collaborated globally with clients on projects such as Gallery One at the Cleveland Museum of Art, the White House Visitor Center, the William H. Gross Stamp Gallery at the National Postal Museum, the College Football Hall of Fame, and the LBJ Presidential Library.
