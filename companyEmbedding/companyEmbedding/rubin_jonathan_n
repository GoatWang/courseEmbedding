This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

	Magellan Health Services, Inc. (the Company) announced on April 29, 2014 that it will be moving its corporate headquarters to Scottsdale, Arizona. In connection with this change, the Company has determined that the position of Chief Financial Officer should be based in Arizona, and Jonathan N. Rubin, Chief Financial Officer, has decided that he will not be moving to Arizona.  As a result, the Company and Mr. Rubin agreed on April 28, 2014 to an amendment to his employment agreement (the Amendment) pursuant to which he will leave the Company. Mr. Rubin will remain employed with the Company for up to one year to assist in the transition to a Scottsdale, Arizona based Chief Financial Officer.  Pursuant to the Amendment, Mr. Rubins employment will be terminated without cause and containing other terms as generally follows:




	 




	1.


	             


	Mr. Rubin will remain employed with the Company at his current base compensation and benefits for up to one year to assist with the transition to the new Chief Financial Officer.




	2.


	             


	He will receive a bonus equal to his target bonus for 2014 payable upon the termination of his employment.




	3.


	             


	He will also receive a pro-rata target bonus payment for the period, if any, during which he is employed in 2015, payable upon the termination of his employment.




	4.


	             


	His issued and outstanding stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) that would have vested in March 2015 shall be eligible to vest without reference to any continuing employment requirement upon the earlier of termination of his employment or when such stock options would have vested in March 2015, provided that RSUs eligible to vest in 2015 will remain subject to the Company meeting the earnings per share and return on equity performance requirements as provided in such RSU grants, and shall vest only if such performance requirements are met either in the year required or in any permitted subsequent year as specified in the applicable RSU grant documents. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in Mr. Rubins employment agreement-hereinafter a Change in Control) prior to the vesting of such stock options and RSUs that would have been eligible to vest in March 2015, such stock options and RSUs shall vest. Also, in the event that the Company enters into a Change in Control transaction during Mr. Rubins remaining employment, and any agreement regarding such transaction provides for the vesting of unvested stock options and RSUs of other employees of the Company, all of Mr. Rubins outstanding stock options and RSUs at the time such Change of Control agreement is signed shall vest upon the completion of any such transaction.




	5.


	             


	Mr. Rubin will receive a discretionary Supplemental Accumulation Plan contribution of 11% in March 2015.




	6.


	             


	The covenants contained in Mr. Rubins Employment Agreement regarding confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-solicitation of employees shall extend until the later of 12 months from the date of termination of his employment or December 31, 2015.




	7.


	             


	Mr. Rubin will be entitled to severance and other payments upon a termination of employment without cause as provided in his Employment Agreement, except as amended by the Amendment.

	Magellan Health Services Reports First Quarter 2014 Financial Results






	Updates 2014 Guidance





	 





	Avon, Conn.  April 29, 2014 



	Magellan Health Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGLN) today reported financial results for the first quarter 2014, as summarized below. For the quarter ended March 31, 2014, the company reported net revenue of $966.5 million, segment profit of $76.5 million, and net income of $25.7 million, or $0.92 earnings per share (EPS). Segment profit is equal to net revenues less the sum of cost of care, cost of goods sold, direct service costs and other operating expenses, and includes income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, but excludes segment profit (loss) from non-controlling interests held by other parties, as well as stock compensation expense.

	·


	                 


	Revenue increased due to the inclusion of Partners Rx in the current year quarter, new business and rate increases, partially offset by loss of revenues associated with terminated contracts.




	·


	                 


	Segment profit increased mainly due to strong results in the commercial and public sector segments.




	·


	                 


	Net income decreased mainly due to higher depreciation and amortization resulting from asset additions after the prior year quarter and acquisition activity, and a higher effective tax rate as a result of non-deductibility of health insurance fees, offset by higher segment profit.




	 




	As of March 31, 2014, the company had unrestricted cash and investments of $291.8 million. Through last Friday, April 25, Magellan repurchased approximately 470,000 shares, for a total cost of $27.3 million, and to date, has completed roughly 48 percent of the current $300 million authorization.




	 




	It has been an exciting quarter for our pharmacy business, with the announcement of a new acquisition, said Barry M. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of Magellan Health Services. The acquisition of CDMI demonstrates Magellans continued execution on our strategy to create a robust pharmaceutical operation that will drive future profitable growth. CDMI will enhance our capabilities and customer




	 












	 




	relationships, as we strengthen our total drug offering, managing any drug, under any benefit, at any site of service.




	 




	We also continue to make strides in our Magellan Complete Care strategy as we prepare to go live with our SMI Specialty Plan in Florida, Smith said.




	 




	With the companys growing presence in Arizona following the acquisition of Partners Rx, Magellan announced today that its headquarters would be moving from Avon, Conn. to Scottsdale, Ariz. over the course of the next few months. Chairman and CEO Barry Smith will be joined there by certain executive leaders, including the chief financial officer. After thoughtful consideration, CFO Jon Rubin has chosen not to relocate and will be leaving the company. Rubin has agreed to stay for up to a year so that a new CFO may be recruited and oriented. Magellan will maintain its business operations in many current locations, including its office in Connecticut.




	 





	Results and Outlook





	 




	Magellan posted strong results during the first quarter of 2014, particularly in our managed healthcare and specialty solutions businesses, said Rubin.




	 




	We expect to close the CDMI acquisition tomorrow. For the remainder of 2014, CDMI is expected to generate revenues of $28 million and segment profit of $23 million. This acquisition will have a significant tax benefit to Magellan that is estimated to be approximately $80 million, assuming a base purchase price of $205 million, and which will be recognized over 15 years. The tax benefit will increase if there are additional earn-out payments. The purchase price includes $80 million of restricted stock that has service and performance requirements, and which will result in stock compensation expense of approximately $20 million for the remainder of 2014. Depreciation and amortization are estimated to be $9.5 million for 2014. In the current year, the CDMI acquisition is expected to be dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.14 per share, due to the non-cash stock compensation expense and amortization of acquisition intangibles.  Excluding the impact of these non-cash items on EPS, the CDMI acquisition is expected to be accretive by approximately $0.50 per share in 2014.




	 




	Relative to 2014, we are updating our guidance to reflect the impact of the CDMI acquisition as well as share repurchase activity. Our full year 2014 expectations are for revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, net income of $53 million to $69 million, and segment profit of $238 million to $258 million. We are increasing our guidance for cash flow from operations to a range of $204 million to $226 million. Taking into account the impact of share repurchase activity through April 25, 2014, but not considering any potential future share repurchases, our guidance range for fully diluted EPS is estimated to be $1.89 to $2.46 based on 28.1 million average fully diluted shares. Included in our projected EPS estimates is dilution of approximately $0.64 per share related to amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense resulting from restricted stock purchases by sellers in the CDMI acquisition. 

	Management will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, April 29, 2014. To participate in the conference call, interested parties should call 1-800-857-1812 and reference the pass code

Ohh the irony.Jessica Alba's The Honest Company is facing a lawsuit from consumer Jonathan D. Rubin who alleges the celebrity's line is being dishonest. According to legal documents obtained by E! News, Rubin claims the brand "deceptively and misleadingly labeled and marketed its products."The Honest Company always has labeled its products, including sunscreen, diapers, multi-surface cleaner and more as "natural," but Rubin says they're anything but. The documents say certain products "contain ingredients that are not natural." Another of the products, Rubin claims, "is ineffective.""Based on Honest's representations that the Products were natural, [Rubin] and the Class paid a premium for the Products over comparable products that did not purport to be natural," the lawsuit reads. "Instead of receiving products that were natural, [Rubin] and the Class received the Products, which, contrary to Honest's representations, contained synthetic ingredients."Rubin and the class members are seeking at least $5 million in damages plus interest on all liquidated sums.



NEWS: Inside Jessica Alba's office at The Honest Company






Alba and her company, valued at nearly $1 billion, faced tremendous backlash at the end of July when parents complained the brand's SPF 30 sunscreen left children with damaging sunburns. People turned to the Internet to express their disappointment.Negative reviews from the lotion's product page on Costco's website included, "My entire family got a sunburn even though we applied multiple times throughout the day. This was the first sunburn for my children which is so disappointing."Another dissatisfied buyer wrote, "I covered myself with this sunscreen and now I am burnt to a crisp." 



NEWS: Jessica Alba says she has a muffin top, cellulite and stretch marks


















The Honest Company released a statement to E! News in response."The Honest Company is committed to providing safe and effective products and take all consumer feedback very seriously. Our Sunscreen Lotion was tested, by an independent 3rd party, against the protocols prescribed by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) monograph for over-the-counter sunscreen products. The results showed that our product is effective and safe for use as an 80 minute water-resistant (FDA's highest rating), SPF 30 sunscreen lotion in accordance with FDA regulations when used as directed (Shake Well. Apply liberally and evenly 15 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply after 80 minutes of swimming or sweating, immediately after towel drying and at least every 2 hours). We stand behind the safety and efficacy of this product."

Ohh the irony.Jessica Alba's The Honest Company is facing a lawsuit from consumer Jonathan D. Rubin who alleges the celebrity's line is being dishonest. According to legal documents obtained by E! News, Rubin claims the brand "deceptively and misleadingly labeled and marketed its products."The Honest Company always has labeled its products, including sunscreen, diapers, multi-surface cleaner and more as "natural," but Rubin says they're anything but. The documents say certain products "contain ingredients that are not natural." Another of the products, Rubin claims, "is ineffective.""Based on Honest's representations that the Products were natural, [Rubin] and the Class paid a premium for the Products over comparable products that did not purport to be natural," the lawsuit reads. "Instead of receiving products that were natural, [Rubin] and the Class received the Products, which, contrary to Honest's representations, contained synthetic ingredients."Rubin and the class members are seeking at least $5 million in damages plus interest on all liquidated sums.



NEWS: Inside Jessica Alba's office at The Honest Company






Alba and her company, valued at nearly $1 billion, faced tremendous backlash at the end of July when parents complained the brand's SPF 30 sunscreen left children with damaging sunburns. People turned to the Internet to express their disappointment.Negative reviews from the lotion's product page on Costco's website included, "My entire family got a sunburn even though we applied multiple times throughout the day. This was the first sunburn for my children which is so disappointing."Another dissatisfied buyer wrote, "I covered myself with this sunscreen and now I am burnt to a crisp." 



NEWS: Jessica Alba says she has a muffin top, cellulite and stretch marks


















The Honest Company released a statement to E! News in response."The Honest Company is committed to providing safe and effective products and take all consumer feedback very seriously. Our Sunscreen Lotion was tested, by an independent 3rd party, against the protocols prescribed by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) monograph for over-the-counter sunscreen products. The results showed that our product is effective and safe for use as an 80 minute water-resistant (FDA's highest rating), SPF 30 sunscreen lotion in accordance with FDA regulations when used as directed (Shake Well. Apply liberally and evenly 15 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply after 80 minutes of swimming or sweating, immediately after towel drying and at least every 2 hours). We stand behind the safety and efficacy of this product."
