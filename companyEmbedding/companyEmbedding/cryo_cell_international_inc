CRYO-CELL DIFFERENCE



 










Cord Blood Banking


Cord Blood is the blood that remains in the vein of the umbilical cord and placenta at the time of birth. Cord blood is rich in hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to all the other blood cells and is the foundation of our bodies’ immune system. Cord blood stem cells are already being used to treat nearly 80 diseases, including: leukemia, lymphoma, anemia, and inherited metabolic disorders. Over 30,000 transplants worldwide have been performed using stem cells from umbilical cord blood and because stem cell technologies continue to advance, the opportunities to utilize preserved cord blood are steadily increasing.

Stem Cells from your newborn’s cord blood can be used not only to safeguard that specific child’s future, but they can mostly likely be used to treat their siblings, parents and other close relatives in the event that a disease manifests itself. Cryo-Cell’s umbilical cord blood banking service processes and cryogenically preserves these cells for potential therapeutic use.

Cord Tissue Banking


Umbilical cord tissue is able to be collected at the same time as umbilical cord blood and contains another type of stem cell called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, to secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and to differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage.

Umbilical cord tissue derived MSCs are increasingly being utilized in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions including heart and kidney disease, ALS, MS, Alzheimer’s, wound healing and autoimmune diseases. Many clinical trials are already underway investigating the use of MSC’s for stem cell treatments. MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord tissue are a safe, easily collected, and readily available, source of stem cells. Cryo-Cell also offers umbilical cord tissue banking service together with cord blood banking.

Treatments and Research
Regenerative therapy is the practice of delivering cells and cell products to renew diseased or damaged tissues in a specific area. It is one of the fastest growing fields of medical research. Each year, new regenerative therapies using stem cells from cord blood and cord tissue enter into clinical trials for the treatment of chronic and life-threatening diseases. If proven successful, these clinical trials will lead to approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With FDA-approval, these treatments can then be administered as a general practice.
Treating Diseases
 Currently, cord blood stem cells have been approved by the FDA in the treatment nearly 80 diseases. In addition to these approved regenerative therapies, there are close to 350 clinical trials underway investigating the use of umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord tissue for stem cell transplantation, and this number promises to steadily increase. Cord blood stem cells are approved for numerous types of malignancies, anemias, inherited metabolic disorders and deficiencies of the immune system. The majority of cord blood transplants to date have been performed in patients younger than 18 years; however, advancements in regenerative medicine show promise for all ages. See all the diseases currently being treated.

Current trials show promise for cord blood in the treatment of strokes, heart disease, diabetes and more. Umbilical cord–derived stem cells, meanwhile, are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, sports-related injuries and various neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (known also as Lou Gehrig’s disease) and Alzheimer’s.
 
Cord blood and cord tissue stem cells are currently undergoing clinical trials for a variety of diseases including ones once thought untreatable:
  

Autism
Cerebral Palsy
Alzheimer's Disease
Multiple Sclerosis
Parkinson's Disease
Wounds and Burns
Heart Disease
diabetes
stroke
Sports' Injuries

Stem Cells’ Role
Stem cells’ role is critical for regenerative medicine. A stem cell is a special type of cell because it is the basis for all the other cells in our bodies. Stem cells have the ability to develop into one of many different types of cells. This process of a stem cell becoming a specific type of cell like a skin cell, blood cell or bone cell is known as differentiation. The other unique ability of stem cells is to replicate quickly. Combined, these abilities can quickly replenish different types of cells, making stem cells a driving factor or major enhancement in the healing process.
Umbilical cord blood and tissue stem cells
Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood were first discovered in 1978. The stem cells found in cord blood give rise to all the other blood cells and are the foundation of our bodies’ immune system. More recently, scientists discovered a rich supply of a different type of stem cell in the cord tissue. These stem cells give rise to the tissues that comprise our nervous system, sensory organs, circulatory tissues, skin, bone, cartilage and more.

An Introduction to Cord Tissue
Umbilical cord blood and cord tissue are rich in two distinct types of stem cells. Both types of stem cells play key roles in maintaining our health and each works in its unique way.
 
The CORD TISSUE or Wharton’s jelly is the tissue surrounding the umbilical vein and vessels in the cord. When the vessels are removed you have tissue remaining which contains stem cells termed mesenchymal stem cells or MSCs. MSCs are unique and powerful stem cells that help repair and heal the body in different ways than cord blood. The surrounding tissue is also a rich source of other cell types, which have different potential uses.
 
Mesenchymal stem cells have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage. 
Why Should I Store Cord Tissue and Cord Blood Stem Cells?
MSCs collected from cord tissue have the ability to regenerate and differentiate into many different types of cells and therefore, they can potentially be used to treat more conditions than cord blood alone can treat.40 MSCs are increasingly being utilized in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions including heart and kidney disease, ALS, wound healing and autoimmune diseases.
 
Many new studies show that regenerative medicine is most effective with a mix of stem cell types (simulating the team work taking place within our organs and tissues). MSC’s have been used in clinical trials to complement the cord blood stem cells in the same transplant.41, 42 
 
As awareness grows of the future potential uses of MSCs and other cord tissue cells, so too does the number of families preserving both cord blood and cord tissue. Umbilical cord tissue banking is now commonplace, with over 60% of Cryo-Cell’s customers electing to store both.
Cord Tissue Processing

Cryo-Cell International provides the service to collect, test, process and cryopreserve the cord tissue for potential future therapeutic use. The cord tissue banking process begins with the procurement of approximately six inches of the umbilical cord tissue at time of birth, after the cord is cut, cord blood collected, and placenta delivered. The segment of the cord is cleansed, cut and placed in a container containing antibiotics for transport to the laboratory. The cord tissue collection is safe and may be collected in both vaginal and cesarean section births. The container will be transported along with the cord blood for immediate processing once it reaches the laboratory.

Stem Cells You Can Count On

Cryo-Cell International’s processing method provides the most flexibility for the future use of cord tissue stem cells. Cord tissue stem cells are cryopreserved in their natural environment and then extracted immediately before expected use. Certain other cord blood banks extract the stem cells from the tissue through enzymatic digestion before cryopreservation.43 Unlike other companies who extract only the MSC’s from cord tissue, Cryo-Cell International stores the umbilical cord tissue in its entirety to preserve multiple cell types that may be beneficial in future cell therapies for your baby and family.
 




NOT ALL BLOOD BANKS ARE CREATED EQUAL




Cryo-Cell International
Other Cord Blood Banks


Cryo-Cell’s cord tissue processing method preserves as many cell types as possible to maximize parents’ future health options. Should future cell therapies be developed using any of the cord tissue cell types, Cryo-Cell International families will have stored these relevant cells.
			 
By isolating the stem cells prior to cryopreservation, these cord blood banks may be discarding some of the other types of stem cells. 


Because Cryo-Cell International stores cord tissue in up to 6 vials, cord tissue stem cells may be used in multiple therapeutic treatments and thawed at different times.
Processing methods may not comply with future FDA guidelines. That means that these precious cord tissue stem cells, when actually needed for treatment, may be deemed unusable due to processing protocols that are not universally accepted today and may not be universally acceptable in the future.
			 




The latest research points to the critical importance of storing the cord tissue prior to processing in order to provide the best possible chance the cord tissue stem cells will be acceptable if needed for a wider range of treatments and clinical applications.
			 
 








Cryo-Cell International’s cord tissue cryopreservation processing method has been independently acknowledged as the best in the industry.  According to scientific data published in the October, 2015 issue of Placenta,
 
"…it seems that umbilical cord tissue cryopreservation appears to be the optimal solution for umbilical cord tissue MSCs storage for future clinical use because the cryopreservation of the previously isolated and expanded cells using unstandardized protocols can be considered non compliant in relation to future accepted standards."44 

 



Cord Tissue Stem Cells Will Play a Key Role in Regenerative Medicine

Stem cells derived from cord tissue are being utilized in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions and are currently being investigated in hundreds of clinical trials. While the research is in its early stages, the possibilities are extremely promising. By banking your baby’s umbilical cord blood and tissue stem cells today, you increase his or her access to these treatments in the future. For more information on these clinical trials, visit  http://clinicaltrials.gov.
 



Current clinical trials include


ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease)
Lupus


Alzheimer’s
Muscular Dystrophy


Aplastic anemia
Multiple Sclerosis


Autism
Myocardial infarction


Cardiomyopathy
Osteoarthritis


Cartilage repair
Parkinson’s


Cerebral Palsy
Rheumatoid arthritis


Crohn’s Disease
Spinal cord injuries


Connective tissue diseases
Stroke


Diabetes
Traumatic optic neuropathy


Liver failure
Ulcerative colitis


Lung injury
Wounds, burns, ulcers



 
The potential use of cord tissue stem cells for regenerative applications and to treat debilitating diseases is steadily increasing. Parents want to know they can count on the stem cells they have stored if they are ever needed. Cryo-Cell International umbilical cord tissue cryopreservation insures future clinical use in the event they are ever needed.

Should umbilical cord tissue cells be considered for potential utilization in a future therapeutic application, further laboratory processing may be necessary. Regarding umbilical cord tissue, all private blood banks’ activities for New York State residents are limited to collection, processing, and long-term storage of umbilical cord tissue stem cells. The possession of a New York State license for such collection, processing and long-term storage does not indicate approval or endorsement of possible future uses or future suitability of these cells.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 11/09/1999
            

                BBB has determined that Cryo-Cell International, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

CRYO-CELL DIFFERENCE



 










Cord Blood Banking


Cord Blood is the blood that remains in the vein of the umbilical cord and placenta at the time of birth. Cord blood is rich in hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to all the other blood cells and is the foundation of our bodies’ immune system. Cord blood stem cells are already being used to treat nearly 80 diseases, including: leukemia, lymphoma, anemia, and inherited metabolic disorders. Over 30,000 transplants worldwide have been performed using stem cells from umbilical cord blood and because stem cell technologies continue to advance, the opportunities to utilize preserved cord blood are steadily increasing.

Stem Cells from your newborn’s cord blood can be used not only to safeguard that specific child’s future, but they can mostly likely be used to treat their siblings, parents and other close relatives in the event that a disease manifests itself. Cryo-Cell’s umbilical cord blood banking service processes and cryogenically preserves these cells for potential therapeutic use.

Learn More




Cord Tissue Banking


Umbilical cord tissue is able to be collected at the same time as umbilical cord blood and contains another type of stem cell called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, to secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and to differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage.

Umbilical cord tissue derived MSCs are increasingly being utilized in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions including heart and kidney disease, ALS, MS, Alzheimer’s, wound healing and autoimmune diseases. Many clinical trials are already underway investigating the use of MSC’s for stem cell treatments. MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord tissue are a safe, easily collected, and readily available, source of stem cells. Cryo-Cell also offers umbilical cord tissue banking service together with cord blood banking.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
