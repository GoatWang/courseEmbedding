        Billings man sentenced to prison for Rosetta Stone fraud
    


CLAIR JOHNSON Of The Gazette Staff

Jun 2, 2010

















































































A Billings man who used fraudulently obtained credit cards to
resell Rosetta Stone language tutorials apologized for his role in
an international conspiracy as he was sentenced to 2-1/2 years in
federal prison Wednesday.“I do fully regret any harm I caused,” said Randall Craig Senn, 27.
“I’m here accepting responsibility.”Senior U.S. District Judge Jack Shanstrom sentenced Senn at about
the middle of the guideline range and ordered $521,869 restitution.
The range was 27 months to 33 months. He also imposed three years
of supervised release, which includes restrictions on Senn’s
computer use.
“This was quite a business,” Shanstrom said. “You did take
advantage of unauthorized credit cards.”Senn pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to commit fraud. Senn
cooperated with the investigation in return for the government not
bringing additional charges.Senn admitted working with two brothers in Jordan to use
fraudulently obtained credit cards to buy products through the
Internet and then resell them online through services like
eBay.Senn made about $100,000 in a conspiracy that ran for about seven
months, from October 2008 until April 2009, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ryan Archer. Senn’s conduct cost Rosetta Stone more than
$500,000 in losses in about six months, he said.The investigation began after Rosetta Stone, which sells software
for learning languages, found that a customer using the computer
name “Littlbuger” made thousands of dollars in online purchases
using many fraudulent credit card numbers.A Secret Service investigation found that a majority of the credit
cards were issued by Chase Bank, which determined the cards were
compromised by a computer program that creates valid credit card
numbers using calculations.The numbers used to buy Rosetta Stone products belonged mostly to
small-business owners, each of whom reported having one
unauthorized purchase to the company, Archer said.
Investigators tracked “Littlbuger” to Senn, who resold the Rosetta
Stone products through online services. Some of the services
suspended Senn because of the fraudulent nature of transactions.
Agents executed a search warrant at Senn’s house and business and
seized his computers.Senn told agents he had met a Jordanian, Osama Moosa Al Hami,
online and that Al Hami sent Rosetta Stone products to his
residence for resale on the Internet. Senn resold the products for
about half their retail value and split the profits with Al Hami.
Senn also admitted to selling a few products from Hasbro Toys and
Pet Medication.Al Hami, who implicated Senn as his partner, is being prosecuted in
the Jordanian justice system.Defense attorney Robert Kelleher Jr. asked for no prison, or in the
alternative, a low-end sentence because Senn has three young
children, has never been in trouble before and he could begin
making restitution if allowed to remain free, he said.
A computer programmer, Senn has lost two jobs because of the
charges and told the judge he was getting unemployment.The prosecutor said a guideline sentence would hold Senn
accountable and send a message.“This conduct simply cannot be tolerated,” Archer said.Senn’s use of the Internet and credit cards to commit crime is one
of the fastest-growing areas of fraud, Archer said. Senn may not
have started out to commit fraud, but frauds of this kind are
“almost addictive,” he said. When Senn learned the activity was
fraudulent, he worked his way around controls on websites to keep
selling, he said.In Senn’s own Internet postings, he minimized his conduct and
blamed the government and Rosetta Stone for making an example of
him, Archer said.Shanstrom allowed Senn to remain free until assigned to a
prison.

Randall Craig Senn Arraigned and Pleads Guilty in U.S. Federal Court

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wednesday, March 03, 2010


The United States Attorney's Office announced that during a federal court session in Billings on March 3, 2010, before Senior U.S. District Judge Jack D. Shanstrom, RANDALL CRAIG SENN, a 27-year-old resident of Billings, was arraigned and pled guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud.  Sentencing has been set for June 2, 2010.  He is currently released on special conditions.

In an Offer of Proof filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan M. Archer, the government stated it would have proved at trial the following:

Rosetta Stone is a company that sells all-inclusive language tutorials and other products.  The fraud enforcement section of Rosetta Stone determined that a customer using the username "Littlbuger" made thousands of dollars in online purchases using numerous fraudulent credit card numbers. 

The U.S. Secret Service discovered that a majority of the fraudulently used credit cards were issued by Chase Bank.  Chase Bank determined that the cards were compromised by a computer program called "Credit Master."  This program creates valid credit card numbers using an algorithm.  The numbers used to purchase Rosetta Stone products belonged mostly to small business owners, each of whom had reported one unauthorized purchase to Rosetta Stone.

Investigation into the username "Littlbuger" revealed documents and records identifying SENN in Billings.  SENN was further identified as re-selling Rosetta Stone products through online services such as E-Bay, ioffer.com, Blue-pay and Google Check-out -  several of which suspended SENN from selling items based on the fraudulent nature of the transactions.

A search warrant was executed at SENN's place of business and personal residence.  At the time, SENN stated that he met Osama Moosa Al Hami and his brother online.  Al Hami resided in Jordan and provided the Rosetta Stone products for SENN to re-sell in the United States through online services.  Al Hami had Rosetta Stone merchandise directly delivered to SENN's residence and SENN agreed to sell the products for half their retail value.  SENN kept 45-50% of the profits while sending the rest to Al Hami.  He also admitted to selling a few products from Hasbro Toys and Pet Medication.  SENN stated that at the end he knew it was not right, but could not stop because of the amount of money coming in.

A search of SENN's computers revealed correspondence with Al Hami indicating that SENN was aware of the scheme.  At one point SENN requested that Al Hami create a fabricated certificate indicating they were authorized retailers of Rosetta Stone products.  Western Union and Money Gram wires also showed that SENN wired Al Hami money in Zarka and Amman, Jordan. 

In coordination with the Secret Service, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate located, identified and arrested Osama Al Hami in Amman Jordan.  A forensic examination of his computer disclosed several unauthorized credit card numbers along with a program capable of generating valid numbers.  Al Hami admitted to using the credit cards to unlawfully purchase goods from Rosetta Stone and Hasbro.  He also implicated SENN as his partner.  Jordanian law enforcement officials are pursuing charges against Al Hami in the Jordanian justice system.

A financial analysis indicates that SENN made approximately $100,000 between October 2008 and April 2009.

SENN faces possible penalties of 5 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and 3 years supervised release.

The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Secret Service.

A copy of the Offer of Proof can be obtained by contacting Sally Frank at (406) 247-4638.
