Through its Blue Ribbon subsidiary, the Company markets and distributes its own branded, processed meat products under the Blue Ribbon brand name. Blue Ribbon has been the leading brand of bacon in the Houston market for ten years. The Company's Carlton subsidiary manufactures a variety of smoked sausage products, including products sold by Blue Ribbon and by Potter Sausage under the J.C. Pott er brand name. Carlton markets its own branded, smoked sausage products under the Carlton brand name and provides private label manufacturing for other regional sausage brands and selected supermarket house brands. Through its Richard's subsidiary, the Company manufactures, markets and distributes Cajun-style, smoked sausage products and specialty foods for customers in the state of Louisiana. These products are sold under the Richard's brand name. Richard's also produces a line of authentic Cajun entrees under the Richard's Cajun Favorites label. Richards' has become the #1 brand of Cajun entrees produced in the United States with distribution in ten states. Through its Potter Sausage subsidiary, the Company manufactures, markets and distributes premium breakfast sausage, bacon, smoked sausage, and other sausage items for customers based primarily in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas. J.C. Potter markets its own branded products under the J.C. Potter brand name and provides private label manufacturing for grocery and food service chains, and other branded food companies. J.C. Potter recently signed Troy Aikman, three time Super Bowl Champion, six time NFL all pro and future member of the NFL football hall of fame as our spokesperson. In making the announcement Tom Dalton, President and CEO said "We're proud and excited to have a person of Troy's high personal standards, stature in the community and impeccable reputation for integrity join our J.C. Potter team, " Dalton said. "He is a key element in our strategy to continue our expansion the J.C. Potter brand beyond its existing consumer franchise in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Missouri." Aikman, who spent his high school years in Oklahoma said "This agreement with J.C. Potter was a natural for me, as it brings me together with a childhood favorite. Growing up in Henryetta, Oklahoma, we always had J.C. Potter's sausage on the breakfast table," he said. "I'm proud to be able to represent a high quality product that both my family and I have enjoyed for years." All these subsidiaries fit Atlantic Premium's brand strategy. The Company plans to continue to acquire strong, regional brands in selected states and categories within the processed meats industry. The Company strives to preserve each aquisition's inherent strengths while simultaneously adding functional skills and capturing operational synergies. Finally, the Company plans to identify and determine how best to leverage each acquisition's underlying assets by introducing further value-added products.

Commitments of each Investor Member shall be reduced pro rata based on their

the Members in proportion to their respective Equity Commitments.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not make a distribution to the Members on account of their
interests in the Company if such distribution would violate the Securities Act
or other applicable law.
ARTICLE IV
MEMBERS AND ACTIONS
4.1.�������� Powers of Members.
The Members shall have the power to exercise any and all rights or powers
granted to the Members pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement. Members
shall not have the authority to bind the Company by virtue of their status as
Members.
4.2.�������� Controlling Member Decisions.
(a)���������� Except
to the extent any Section of this Agreement expressly provides otherwise, the Controlling
Members, in consultation with all Members, shall make all decisions
4 

�with respect to
all actions taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub),
including, but not limited to, any decision with respect to the Merger
Agreement; including, but not limited to, the exclusive right to make any determination
(including with respect to waivers of any conditions and determination as to
satisfaction of any conditions) or decision to exercise any rights to terminate
the Merger Agreement pursuant to Article 7 (�Termination, Amendment and Waiver�)
of the Merger Agreement or to waive any conditions specified under Sections 6.1
(�Conditions to Each Party�s Obligation to Effect the Merger�) and 6.2 (�Conditions
to Obligation of Parent and MergerCo�) of the Merger Agreement, including
preparatory action relating to any of the foregoing (e.g., writing of letters),
which decision or termination shall be absolute and binding on the other
Members and shall be exercised in the sole discretion of the Controlling Members;
provided, however, that the Controlling Members may not cause the
Company or Merger Sub to take any action in a way that has a material
disproportionate and adverse impact on an Investor Member relative to the other
Investor Members without such materially disproportionately and adversely
impacted Investor Member�s consent, other than action set forth in this
Agreement.
(b)���������� If
the Controlling Members have agreed to take any action under Section 4.2(a)
to (i) increase or modify the amount or form of the consideration to be offered
by the Members to acquire Educate in the Transaction (such a decision, a �Change in Merger Consideration�) or (ii)
modify or waive, in a manner adverse to the Company or the Investor Members,
the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to the Termination Fee, the
Acquiror Expenses, the Company Expenses or the Damages Cap (any such action in
(i) or (ii), a �Trigger Action�),
and any Investor Member declines to consent to such Trigger Action, such Investor
Member may terminate its participation in the Transaction (a �Terminating Investor Member�) and shall have no obligation to
contribute its proportionate share of the Equity Commitments or have any
liability by reason of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Investor
Member Equity Commitment Letters, the Limited Guarantees or any related
documents (except in respect of prior breaches, if any) other than any
obligation or liability pursuant to Sections 5.5, 5.6, and Article
VI of this Agreement, whether or not the Transaction is ultimately
consummated, and the Terminating Investor Member shall be released from any
liability under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Investor Member Equity
Commitment Letters, the Limited Guaranteesor
any related documents, other than as set forth above; provided, however,
that if the Terminating Investor Member is subsequently replaced by a new Investor
Member that assumes in full the Terminating Investor Member�s Equity
Commitment, the Terminating Investor Member�s obligation to pay its
proportionate share of Group Fees and Expenses (as defined in Section 5.6
of this Agreement) shall also be assumed by the new Investor Member, provided
further that the Terminating Investor Member�s obligation to pay its
proportionate share of Group Fees and Expenses shall also be reduced pro rata
to the extent the Terminating Investor Member�s Equity Commitment is accepted
by the other Investor Members or new investors pursuant to the last sentence of
this Section 4.2(b). The Controlling Members must provide two business
days� prior written notice of their intention to approve any Trigger Action
pursuant to Section 4.2(a). Upon receipt of any such notice, if an
Investor Member does not provide written notice to the other Members within five
(5) business days of its intent to terminate its participation in the
Transaction pursuant to this Section 4.2(b), it shall be deemed to have
consented to such Trigger Action. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event an
Investor Member terminates its participation in the Transaction, such
Terminating Investor Member shall no longer be an Investor Member or a Member
of the Company, but shall remain bound by the terms of such Investor Member�s 
5 

confidentiality agreement with Educate, datedOctober 3, 2006, or any joinder thereto, as
applicable. In the event an Investor Member terminates its participation
in the Transaction, the amount of the Terminating Investor Member�s Equity
Commitment shall first be offered to the other Investor Members in proportion
to their respective Equity Commitments at the time of such termination, and if
none or not all of the Terminating Investor Member�s Equity Commitment is
accepted by the other Investor Members, then the Controlling Members
(excluding, for this purpose, the Terminating Investor Member) may offer the
Terminating Investor Member�s Equity Commitment, or remaining portion thereof,
to the other Investor Members or to a new investor or investors.
4.3.�������� Public Announcements.
Except as otherwise required by law, including any securities laws or rules of
a self-regulatory organization, the content of all public announcements issued
by any Member concerning the Transaction or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement shall be subject to the consent of all the
Members, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
4.4.�������� Syndication.
No Member may syndicate its Equity Commitment without the prior written consent
of the Controlling Members. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, an Investor Member may syndicate its Equity Commitment without
the prior written consent of the Controlling Members to its affiliated funds,
entities and investment vehicles and to co-investors where the Investor Member or
its affiliates retains direct or indirect control over voting and disposition
(a �Permitted Assignee�); provided,
however, that no such syndication shall relieve such Investor Member of
its obligations under this Agreement and its Investor Member Equity Commitment
Letter. At Closing, the Members will cause their respective Permitted Assignees
to enter into all documentation necessary to cause such Permitted Assignee to
become a Member.
4.5.�������� Debt Financing.
All actions and decisions of the Company or Merger Sub with respect to debt
financing (including with respect to existing debt commitments) shall require
the approval of the Controlling Members. Without limiting the foregoing, the Controlling
Members may cause the Company or Merger Sub to negotiate, enter into and borrow
under definitive agreements relating to debt financing to be provided at the
Closing.
4.6.�������� Failing Members.
If at the Closing, the conditions to a Member�s equity financing commitment set
forth in such Member�s Equity Commitment Letter are satisfied (it being
understood that any decision in accordance with Section 4.2 shall govern
such determination) and such Member does not fund its commitment or asserts in
writing its unwillingness to fund its commitment in violation of this Agreement
or its Equity Commitment Letter (a �Failing
Member�), the non-Failing Members will be entitled to:
(a)���������� terminate
the Failing Member�s participation in the Transaction, it being understood that
no such termination shall affect the other Members� rights against such Failing
Member with respect to such failure or unwillingness to fund;
(b)���������� require
specific performance of the provisions of such Failing Member�s Equity
Commitment (and/or limited guaranty, if applicable), whether before or after
the Closing, together with any costs of enforcement, the Members hereby
acknowledging and agreeing that 
6 

irreparable damage would occur in the event
such provisions were not performed in accordance with the terms therein; and/or
(c)���������� require
payment by the Failing Member in an amount equal to the actual damages caused
by such Failing Member (including amounts paid under any Company Expenses) up
to the amount of the
Damages Cap plus any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-Failing
Members in connection with the Transaction. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Member shall be liable for damages in excess
of the Damages Cap plus out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-Failing
Members in connection with the Transaction as a result of such Member�s breach
of this Agreement or such Member�s Equity Commitment Letter.
ARTICLE V
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
5.1.�������� Regulatory Efforts.
(a)���������� If
any Governmental Entity asserts any objections under any antitrust, energy or
other regulatory law or regulation with respect to the Transaction in
connection with any regulatory clearances that are conditions precedent under
the Merger Agreement to the Closing and such objections relate to the
activities or investments of an Investor Member or such Investor Member�s
affiliated funds, such Investor Member will use its reasonable best efforts to
take such actions that are within its power and authority as may be necessary
to resolve such objections with respect to the Transaction so as to enable the
Closing to occur no later than the earlier of (i) the Outside Date and (ii) the
date all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied.
(b)���������� No
Member shall commit to take any actions or positions on behalf of the Company
with respect to obtaining a clearance or approval from any Governmental Entity
for the Transaction without the approval of the Controlling Members. All
Members shall make reasonable best efforts to give each Member the opportunity
to participate in making any decisions as to actions or positions the Company
will take with respect to obtaining a clearance or approval from any
Governmental Entity for the Transaction.
(c)���������� Subject
to applicable law, no Member shall, and the Company will not, commit to take
any actions or positions on behalf of any other Members in connection with
obtaining regulatory clearances without such Member�s prior consent.
5.2.�������� Voting Agreement.
All actions and decisions to be taken by the Company or Merger Sub relating to
the Voting Agreement, including with respect to any waivers, extensions,
amendments, enforcement actions or negotiations relating to any of the
foregoing, shall be made or taken by the Controlling Members.
5.3.�������� Equity Commitment Letters.
Except with respect to any amendment of any Equity Commitment Letter, or as
otherwise as set forth in Section 4.6, all actions and decisions to be
taken by the Company relating to any Equity Commitment Letter, including with
respect to any waivers, extensions, enforcement actions or negotiations
relating to any Equity Commitment 
7 

Letter or any actions or decisions to be
taken in respect thereof, shall be made or taken by the Controlling Members or,
with respect to any Equity Commitment Letter of a Controlling Member, a
majority of the non-Controlling Members, based on each non-Controlling Member�s
Equity Commitment.
5.4.�������� Allocation of Termination Fee.
(a)���������� Any
termination fee or expense reimbursement payment paid by Educate or any of its
affiliates pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the �Termination Fee�) will be applied first (i) to any
out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by the Members in connection with the
Transaction, including legal fees and fees required to be paid to the Members�
financial advisor(s) in the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement, and
second (ii) to the Investor Members (other than any Failing Member or
Terminating Investor Member) or their designees and in proportion to their
respective Equity Commitments.
(b)���������� In
the event any fee or expense reimbursement payment is required to be paid by
the Members (including as a result of any obligation by the Company to pay such
a fee or payment under the Merger Agreement) to Educate (such fee or payment,
the �Company Expenses�), the Company Expenses shall be paid by
the Investor Members in proportion to their respective Equity Commitments; provided,
however, that in the event the Company
Expenses are� payable as a result
of a breach of this Agreement or such Member�s Equity Commitment Letter, by any
Member (such Member, the �Defaulting Member�),
the Defaulting Member shall pay and bear the full responsibility for payment of
the Company Expenses and the
Members who are not Defaulting Members (the �Non-Defaulting
Members�) shall not be required to pay any amount of the Company Expenses. In the event there
are two or more Defaulting Members, the Defaulting Members shall be liable to
pay the entire amount of the Company
Expenses in proportion to the ratio of the Equity Commitment of each
Defaulting Member to the Equity Commitments of the other Defaulting Member(s).
5.5.�������� Allocation of Expenses.
If the Transaction is consummated, the Company shall cause the surviving corporation
(i.e., Educate) to pay or reimburse each Member (other than a Failing Investor Member)
for any and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by it in connection
with the Transaction; provided, that a Terminating Investor Member shall
only be entitled to be reimbursed for its fees and expenses incurred prior to
such Member becoming a Terminating Investor Member. If the Transaction is not
consummated, (a) each of the Investor Members (including a Failing Investor Member
and a Terminating Investor Member) will be responsible for the fees and
expenses of legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other
consultants or advisors and any financing or other fees and expenses incurred
by Company or Merger Sub or by any of the Investor Members in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any expenses
incurred in connection with due diligence and the negotiation of the Merger
Agreement and any related documents and any regulatory filing fees (the �Group Fees and Expenses�), in proportion to
their respective Equity Commitments; provided, however, that a
Terminating Investor Member shall only be responsible for its proportionate
share of the Group Fees and Expenses incurred prior to such Member becoming a
Terminating Investor Member.
8 

5.6.�������� Termination of Agreements.
The Members hereby agree that upon the consummation of the Merger, the Members
shall, or shall cause Educate to, as applicable take all actions necessary to
effectuate the termination of the following agreements: (a) the Confidentiality Agreement by and between Educate, Sterling

2006 and (ii) the Joinder Agreement by Citigroup Private Equity, a unit of
Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC, dated October 4, 2006.
5.7.�������� Contributions With Respect to
Limited Guarantees. The Members shall cooperate in
defending any claim with respect to which the Investor Members are or any of
them is, or is alleged to be, liable to make payments under the Limited
Guarantees. Subject to Sections 4.6 and 5.4, each Investor Member
agrees to contribute to the amount paid or payable by the other Investor Members

paid an amount equal to the product of the aggregate amount paid under all of
the Limited Guarantees multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator is such Investor
Member�s Equity Commitment and the denominator is the sum of the Investor
Members� Equity Commitments, which amount shall be reduced proportionately
based on such Investor Members� respective Equity Commitments for any amounts
paid or payable with respect to such Limited Guarantees by any other Investor Member

such Investor Member�s Equity Commitment Letter; provided, however, that a Terminating Investor Member
shall not be liable for any such claims made after such Member became a
Terminating Investor Member.
