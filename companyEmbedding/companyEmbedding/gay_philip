Description



Product Description
(New York, McGraw-Hill, 2001)
A Volume in the Comparative Societies Series.  228 x 152 mm; laminated pictorial dustwrapper; pp. xvi + 219 incl. index; map.  Fine condition.  If racial peace harmony forgiveness reconciliation justice equality and all the rest can come to be in South Africa after Apartheid and all that went before why can’t it happen everywhere? it was asked.  That was then the mid-1990s in the immediate aftermath of South Africa’s first multiracial elections.  Now during the 2000s more and more people both inside and outside the country are beginning to see the Republic of South Africa as shaping up to be more of a big disappointment or a sad shame than a miracle.  White Black Coloured and Asian people didn’t all suddenly come to love each other with the death of Apartheid and coming to power of a multiracial political party.””

OverviewFree PreviewAbout The AuthorCustomer ReviewEditorial Review






Philip is the story of a boy who grows to manhood with a strong sense that
God wants him to be a minister. His dreams are coming true when be graduates
from seminary, gets married and becomes a pastor. But Philip fi nds himself
in confl ict with members of his church who disapprove of the time he spends
helping members of his congregation deal with a housing crisis caused by a
freeway project that disrupts the neighborhood. He is then plunged into deep
inner confl ict as he slowly realizes, through disturbing dreams and a series of
male friendships, that he is gay. Philip explores the inner collision of deeply
held religious values and an equally profound attraction to men in one man’s
resolution of that battle.

Synopsis
About this title




In the last twenty years, gay literature has earned a place at the American and British literary tables, spawning its own constellation of important writers and winning a dedicated audience. No one, though, until Philip Gambone, has attempted to offer a collective portrait of our most important gay fiction writers. This selection of interviews attempts just that and is notable both for the depth of Gambone’s probing conversations and for the sheer range of important authors included.Allen BarnettChristopher BramPeter CameronBernard CooperDennis CooperMichael CunninghamBrad GoochJoseph HansenScott HeimAndrew HolleranAlan HollinghurstBrian Keith JacksonRandall KenanDavid LeavittMichael LowenthalPaul MonetteMichael NavaDavid PlanteJohn PrestonLev RaphaelEdmund White

About the Author:
                                                    Philip Gambone is an award-winning essayist, journalist, and fiction writer living in Boston. He teaches writing at Harvard University. His previous work includes a book of stories, The Language We Use Up Here. He is the author of a novel, Beijing, also published by the Press. Robert Giard contributed photos of sixteen of the writers interviewed.
From Publishers Weekly:
                                                    A welcome compilation of interviews Gambone has conducted with 21 gay writers since 1987, this collection amounts to a compelling portrait gallery of many influential figures. Gambone's knowledge of each writer's work and his sensitivity to the craft is impressive. While consciously eschewing "literary gossip," his carefully probing interviews provide insight into the working methods and aesthetic, personal and social concerns of a varied group, including such well-known writers as Edmund White and Andrew Holleran, as well as those who emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s, including Alan Hollinghurst, Randall Kenan and Scott Heim. Presented in roughly chronological order by date of interview, the book amounts to a broad overview of the "breathlessly rapid" development of gay fiction and its themes, from early coming-out novels (such as Edmund White's A Boy's Own Story) to more complex visions of a world in which gay people are no unhappier than other people. Many of the writers stress how important it is for them to feel the freedom to depict their world honestly. There are also some provocative juxtapositions, in which authors reflect on (and in the notable case of Dennis Cooper, vehemently reject) the work of their contemporaries. Here's hoping that Gambone is at work on volume two. Photos not seen by PW. Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.
