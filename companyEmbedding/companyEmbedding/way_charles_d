With state-of-the-art diagnostics, we evaluate the eye’s pressure, inspect the optic nerve and perform a variety of tests to detect and thoroughly understand your glaucoma. This starts with an annual eye exam, as anyone can be affected by glaucoma at any time. Here are factors that can elevate your risk for glaucoma...Cataract SurgeryThat’s why Evergreen Eye Center is pleased and proud that its surgeons are active participants in Operation Sight. Operation Sight is the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery’s charitable program in which eye surgeons perform cataract surgery at no cost to these needy patients.GlaucomaGlaucoma is the world’s second leading cause of blindness, affecting nearly 3 million people here in the US. Glaucoma is a “silent disease”, stealing your eyesight by causing loss of peripheral vision in a process that is so slow, it is not noticeable until the late stages.OphthalmologyMember: American Academy of Ophthalmology, The Cornea Society, American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Christian Ophthalmology SocietyMacular DegenerationMacular degeneration – If the eye is like a camera, the macula is the film. This light-sensing tissue is critical to clear eyesight, but it can start to deteriorate after years of use, causing loss of central vision. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in older Americans. Because the early stages of this disease aren’t noticeable, it is critically important to see an eye doctor who has the diagnostic capabilities to detect and treat this condition.Laser Eye SurgeryImagine your life without contact lenses or glasses getting in the way. Imagine being able to see well without fussing with spectacles and contacts, cases, solutions, etc. With LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), great vision without contacts or glasses can be your reality. And with the highly trained, dedicated ophthalmologists at the LASIK Center at Evergreen, you get experience, skill, patient-centered care, and the most advanced, precise LASIK treatment available today.CataractsCataracts are the age-related clouding of the eye’s naturally clear lens, causing progressive vision impairment, reduced capability and quality of life, and ultimately total vision loss. A normal process of aging, cataracts affect about 24 million Americans, or roughly 17 percent of the population over age 40, according to the National Eye Institute (National Institutes of Health).EndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathyDiabetic eye disease – Having diabetes is a risk to your eyesight. Prolonged high blood sugars can lead to a condition called Diabetic Retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. Macular edema, the swelling of the macula as a result of diabetic retinopathy, can also cause vision loss.General PractitionersFamily PracticeSend to PhoneBirnbach Charles D Md34719 6th Ave S, Federal Way, WA 98003(206) 212-2100Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailBirnbach Charles D Md34719 6th Ave S, Federal Way, WA 98003(206) 212-2100Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

Publisher's Description▼▲
A radical retelling of the prodigal son story, Long Way Gone takes us from tent revivals to the Ryman Auditorium to the tender relationship between a broken man and the father who never stopped calling him home."No matter where you go, no matter whether you succeed or fail, stand or fall, no gone is too far gone. You can always come home."At the age of eighteen, musician and songwriter Cooper OConnor took everything his father held dear and drove 1,200 miles from home to Nashville, his life riding on a six-string guitar and the bold wager that he had talent. But his wager soon proved foolish.Five years after losing everything, he falls in love with Daley Cross, an angelic voice in need of a song. But just as he realizes his love for Daley, Cooper faces a tragedy that threatens his life as well as his career. With nowhere else to go, he returns home to the remote Colorado mountains, searching for answers about his father and his faith.When Daley shows up on his street corner twenty years later, he wonders if its too late to tell her the truth about his pastand if he is ready to face it himself.


Author Bio▼▲
Charles Martin is a New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author of 12 novels. He and his wife, Christy, live in Jacksonville, Florida. Learn more about him at charlesmartinbooks.com. Facebook: Author.Charles.Martin Twitter: @storiedcareer    


Editorial Reviews▼▲
'Martin (When Crickets Cry) crafts a playful, enticing tale of a modern prodigal son. Told as a memoir, the novel begins in the middle of Cooper OConnors story as he struggles to get his life together on the streets and in the bars of Leadville, Colo. '
Another stellar novel from Martin. His fabulous gift for characterization is evident on each page. Layers of the story are peeled back to show the spiritual truth underneath the gripping plot. Cooper is an intricate character with an amazing story to tell, and the supporting cast is just as important to provide additional depth and understanding. This novel should be on everyones must-purchase list.

                This review was written for Long Way Gone.
            
 
            "Music is a gift. We make it to give away." 


It took Cooper "Peg" O'Connor decades to learn what his father had been faithfully demonstrating for years; "(when you play a song)you're giving them something that no amount of money can buy . . . . . . hope." His journey took him from the mountains of Colorado and a life filled with tent revivals to the street corners of Nashville, Tennessee, where lots of people could play an instrument, but seldom offered the gift of music. Until Cooper meets Daley Cross, the voice that his prodigious fingers were meant to play.


And then he understood, albeit too late, this side of eternity. Years of regret and a sizable bank account could not replace what Cooper had "long way gone". He could only chose to live the extended life that he had been given, ultimately discovering that the God who had waited patiently every step of the way, could take his heart and seal it, offering him unconditional love; for the prodigal had come all the way home. 


This is kind of book, that the more times it is read, will delve its melody deeper into the recesses of your heart, as it gives itself away. 


I received a copy of this book from the publisher. The opinions stated above are entirely my own.

            Really enjoyed this read. The writing style is so different, and the storyline is incredibly well done. Giving this five stars because it touched my heart and brought a tear or two. Very few books do that. 


The characters seem so real, and the plot ( though not original) is so very touching. This was my first by this author, but I don't expect it will be my last. This had a strong faith theme...and a bit of the unseen spiritual world.


Recommend.

            Long Way Gone by Charles Martin


Young Cooper OConnor leaves his father and heads off to Nashville to make a fresh start for himself.  He takes everything of value from his father, expecting that he will make it big there and be able to return after having proved himself.  The years pass and he never sees his father again, but carries the lessons his father taught him in his heart.  Years after a devastating tragedy, Cooper meets up with his long-lost love and wants to make amends but doubts that she will believe the truth.  He must decide if his love for her is worth the risk of rejection yet again.


Charles Martin weaves a beautiful tale of love and second chances set to lyrical prose.  It gives the reader hope that reconciliation and Gods purposes are being worked even in difficult relationships.  I loved this book:  its characters, story line, plot twists, and the satisfying conclusion.  I received a free copy from the publisher for my honest opinion.

                This review was written for Long Way Gone.
            
 
            This book was such a pleasant surprise! Martin is a new-to-me author, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was completely drawn into the story. Packed full of emotion, this modern day prodigal son story really tugs at the heartstrings.


Plot: Cooper O'Connor grew up in the shadow of his father, a tent revival preacher. At eighteen, following an argument with his father, Cooper steals his favorite guitar and money , taking off for Nashville in search of his big break. Things don't go as planned, but his pride won't let Cooper go crawling back to his father. As he gradually scrapes his way to the top, he meets Daley Cross, an amazingly talented singer. Cooper shares a song he wrote with Daley which turns into a big hit. Tragedy strikes, ruining Cooper's chances to win Daley's heart and the two go their separate ways. Many years later, they're reunited when Cooper returns home, but it may be too late for him to reconcile.


The story's told through Cooper's point of view. I enjoyed how it was divided into parts, telling both the past and the present, so the reader learns all about the events that have shaped Cooper's life. As a music lover, I really enjoyed the in depth look at some music history. And how about that gorgeous cover? I love the subtle way they made the road and guitar blend together.


Recommendation: I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian fiction with a great message of hope and redemption. I found it comparable to Nicholas Sparks. I'd suggest making sure you have plenty of tissues handy, as you'll probably need them several times. I will definitely be looking to read more books from this author.


Rating: 4.5/5 stars


I received a copy of this book from the Thomas Nelson Fiction Guild. This review is my honest opinion.

                This review was written for Long Way Gone.
            
 
            This  was an engrossing book - the same day I finished it, I found myself going back and rereading it just to get every nuance.  It was the first book I'd read by Charles Martin, but it certainly won't be the last!


That said, I was a little uncomfortable with the supernatural parts of the book.  They reminded me of Frank Peretti's style, which I'm not sure is entirely supported by the Bible.  It seems to me that that aspect of the story could have been omitted without damaging Cooper's journey.


Loved the main characters in this book - Cooper O'Conner ("Peg") and his musical talent, eclipsed only by his brutal honesty and open-handed generosity.  Martin did an excellent job making this man believable at each stage of his life. And Daley Cross was so winsome - bold and fragile at the same time.  Though am I the only one who wondered at how easily she seemed to trade love for loyalty?  The chemistry between these two musicians was fantastic!  Supporting players like Peg's father and Big-Big were touching and realistic.  Each person in this book deals with pain and loss that would be crushing if not redeemed for a higher purpose.  I was encouraged by the faith they exercised in so many twists and turns. What confidence in the power of love!


One of my disappointments in many books is the author not knowing when to quit. Martin masterfully avoids this in his satisfying epilogue AND the evangelistic pages that follow.  His personal presentation of the good news that restored Peg is clear and sound.  I will enjoy sharing this book with friends....after I finish my second reading of it!


I was given a copy of this book by the publisher via The Fiction Guild, and was not required to post a review, positive or otherwise.
