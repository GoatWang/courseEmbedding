Attorney Profiles








Chicago Injury Lawyers:
Stephen D. Phillips
Managing Partner
“A friend of mine who’s a defense attorney said to me, ‘I told the guy in my office who you have that case against, just give Phillips what he wants because he’s not going to let go. He’s going to drag you back to court until he gets it, so you might as well just give it to him.'”
Mr. Phillips was inducted into the International Academy of Trial Lawyers which represents less than 1% of attorneys worldwide. In a statewide survey of lawyers he was voted as one of the Leading Personal Injury Lawyers in Illinois. He was voted a Superlawyer by his peers in yet another statewide survey of lawyers. He was elected as one of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers in Illinois by the National Trial Lawyers. And, he has been recognized in Chicago Lawyer Magazine as resolving the most $1 million-plus cases than any other lawyer in Illinois in a year.
Avvo.com, an independent rating service of United States attorneys, has given Stephen D. Phillips, their highest rating of 10.0 of 10.0, Superbfor Personal Injury Attorneys in Illinois. Mr. Phillips has also received Avvo.com’s highest rating of 10.0 of 10.0, Superb for medical malpractice, brain injury lawyer, birth injury lawyer, auto accident lawyer, trucking accident lawyer and wrongful death lawyer in Illinois.
Steve has also been recognized in International Who’s Who of Professionals, and is a member of the prestigious Society of Trial Lawyers. Steve is an adjunct professor of law at Loyola Law School Chicago, where he teaches Personal Injury Law and has taught Illinois Civil Procedure. He serves on the Scholarship Committee of the Justinian Society of Lawyers, and he has received the highest possible ratings for legal ability and ethics from Martindale-Hubbell.
He has served consecutive terms on the executive committee of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association, where he has co-chaired the Medical Negligence Committee and the Publications Committee.
On June 9th, 2012, Mr. Phillips was elected President Elect of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association at their annual meeting in Oak Brook, Illinois. He served as President of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association in 2013.
Mr. Phillips has been reelected as one of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers in Illinois by the National Trial Lawyers Association.
He has been elected governor for the Illinois State Bar Association and has served in the State Bar Assembly for three terms.
When asked what it was like to follow in his father’s footsteps as a successful trial lawyer Steve replies, “I had big shoes to fill when I was a young lawyer straight out of law school. So I was always prepared, I always knew the law and I never took shortcuts ever, ever, ever.” Steve began to establish himself right out of school, turning seemingly dead cases into surprising wins through his persistence and dedication. He has maintained his no-holds-barred work ethic throughout his more than 25 years of law practice.
Steve is also a well-respected author and speaker on personal injury and wrongful death issues. He was awarded a ‘Certification of Publication’ for contribution as an author for the 2012 edition Illinois Civil Practice: Opening The Case by the Illinois Institute for Continuing Legal Education.
If you ask Steve how many years he has been practicing law, he may answer, “25 going on 60.” Mr. Phillips, an avid outdoorsman enjoys boating, fishing, hunting, and sports in his leisure time. If he could do anything else for a living, he would probably work in the boating industry or as a fishing guide, but he would still represent a handful of clients every year.
Mr. Phillips was also honored in the Spring 2011 Justinian Society Newsletter. The newsletter honored Steve for his success as a catastrophic injury lawyer, being elected as the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association Vice president, being a leader in many state associations, and for being a community leader. Steve has contributed many thousands of dollars to the Justian Society Scholarship Fund, which makes it easier for future Italian-Americans to become lawyers, as the society averages over $75,000 per year in grants for needy Italian-American law students.

Terrence M. Quinn
Partner
“I like helping people. That’s what I think attracts a lot of people to plaintiff’s work. My parents are social workers, so I come from that background. I think knowing that you have people who are relying on you whose lives are impacted adversely, you’re really working to make their lives easier, and that’s what keeps you going.”
Terry Quinn clerked for our firm during law school, and joined us as an attorney after his admission to the bar. Terry was mentored by our firm’s founder, John G. Phillips. Terry is known for his devotion to the study of law, and his excellent writing, research and analytical skills have made him an invaluable asset. He has already made his mark with numerous successful results.

Kathy & Dan
 

We can’t say enough about Steve Phillips and everyone in his office!! His first priority was for our daughter and helping us make sure she had the best care. His second was for us, as parents, to help us be able to give her what she needed throughout her life. I will recommend Steve and his law office forever!!

Client Testimonials



Shirl
 

I was given Mr. Phillips name by my new doctor (another very satisfied former client of his) after I told her that my case was turned down by 2 other VERY WELL KNOWN law firms because the case was too difficult and that no one would ever testify against the previous doctor who permanently injured me. I called, met with Mr. Phillips and some of his staff, and they were willing to handle the case. Through his and his firm’s hard work, we were able to recover a large sum. The money will never bring my health and condition back to where I was before the malpractice, but now at least I can afford to have live-in nursing care.

Mr. Phillips is #1 in my experience with a wrongful death auto accident case.

Client Testimonials



T.C.
 

I was in an auto accident. I received Mr. Phillips name from a friend of mine who is also a lawyer. He said that Mr. Phillips was one of the top lawyers in Chicago. I did some research on the internet and found out that everything my friend had said about him was true. Although my case was rather small compared to most of the cases that he normally handles, he treated me with the utmost respect. He was patient, listened to all my questions, provided answers and was very responsive whenever I called. I felt like I was a family member, the way he treated me. I was extremely pleased with the results of his work. I would HIGHLY recommend him to ANYONE who needs a personal injury lawyer!!!

            Stephen D. Quinn Scholarship Fund | Quinnie.org         

































































 FIND OUT MORE 












The Stephen D. Quinn Scholarship Fund was established in 2006 by Quinnie’s family and friends to memorialize a great man.
The sole purpose of the fund is to set up scholarships at Our Lady of Victory Grammar School in Floral Park, NY for 8th grade graduates going on to Catholic High Schools. The recipients must embody the spirit, enthusiasm, love of life, faith, sportsmanship, community involvement, and Christian values of Steve Quinn.
Quinnie grew up in Little Neck, attended High School at Bishop Reilly in Queens, went to Stonehill College in Massachusetts, and got married to Kathleen McNally. Together they raised their daughter, Kaitlyn on Long Island, and along the way, amassed a multitude of friends and relatives who loved and adored him.
He was funny, cynical, loving, loyal, honest, candid, patriotic, successful, happy, and fully engaged in every minute of every day.
The best way to describe Quinnie is to read the eulogy so eloquently presented at his funeral mass by his loving daughter, Kaitlyn.
If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact Kathleen Quinn.

The Ignatz Award
To commemorate the 10 year anniversary the Ignatz Award was retired this year. This award was originally supposed to go to someone that Quinnie might have poked some fun at. But over the years the recipients were just some of the kids that Quinnie loved, took under his wing, gave advice to and pointed the occasional Quinnie finger at. So it is appropriate that the final Igantz Award was given to the kid he had the most fun with, the kid he laughed the hardest with and the one he probably pointed that finger at the most.
Quinnie was so lucky when it came to friendships. It is only appropriate that the final Ignatz Award was presented not only to his best friend but his other soul mate, the kid he loved to play with the most, FALS, aka Jimmy Fallon. FALS received a very deserving standing ovation for his devotion to Quinnie and his tireless efforts in making this event the kind of day Quinnie would have loved! 










SCHOLARSHIPS




The 11th annual Stephen D. Quinn Memorial Scholarship
will be awarded at the Our Lady of Victory graduation ceremony in June of 2017. Nominations for candidates will be submitted by OLV in May. Selections will be made by the OLV staff of teachers and administrators.
The 2016 annual scholarships were awarded at Our Lady of Victory School. The recipients were carefully chosen by the Principal and Teachers based on the Foundation’s criteria for the award. The candidates had to embody Quinnie’s sense of sportsmanship and fair play on and off the court. Read more…

On Friday May 26th, 2006, over 350 of Quinnies friends and family gathered together at the Irish American Hall of Mineola to memorialize Steve.
Through donations, raffles, 50/50’s and a live auction, we were able to raise about $40,000 gross and net about $33,000, all of which was deposited in to a CD for future scholarships.
A beer or two was consumed, a few prayers were said and lots of funny stories were told.

RECIPIENTS




In June of this year the Stephen D. Quinn Memorial Scholarships were awarded at Our Lady of Victory School.
The recipients are carefully chosen by the Principal and Teachers based on the Foundation’s criteria for the award. The two candidates truly embody Quinnie’s sense of sportsmanship and fair play.
The scholarships were awarded to Michael Constable and Mary Donnelly. Each candidate received a beautiful plaque and a $1000 scholarship. Michael and Mary represent all the qualities that Quinnie stood for. I’d like to share the recipients’ words of thanks so that everyone can see just how much this scholarship means to them.



From Michael Constable “I would like to express my thanks to you and the Stephen D Quinn Foundation for awarding me this year’s Stephen D. Quinn Scholarship. Words alone cannot express how honored family and I are about this achievement. After reading about Mr. Quinn, I realized that he was a wonderful, caring man with great characteristics that I hope to emulate. I will try my best to imitate his actions throughout my high school years and beyond.”






From Mary Donnelly “I would like to express my gratitude for the Stephen D Quinn Award and Scholarship. I cannot thank you enough for your kindness and generosity. I feel so honored to be chosen for this award. From reading about Mr. Quinn, I have learned about what an amazing person he was and how he greatly influenced everyone he knew. As I go on to high school, I will do my best to honor Mr. Quinn’s memory by striving to be an example of him in all that I do. I am so glad that i was given the opportunity to meet you and your daughter at the awards ceremony. I will always remember your kindness.”



As always, Kaitlyn and I are so impressed by the recipients of this award. Michael and Mary are very accomplished young people. This Scholarship is such a lovely way for us to know that Quinnie is still doing what he did best, reaching out to kids and affecting their lives.
Each year we come together and have a wonderful day of golf and celebrate “Quinnie.” Thanks to the generosity of all involved with this Foundation, we are able to keep “Quinnie’s” legacy alive. To date we have gifted over $20,000 in scholarships in his name. “How great is that.” We congratulate Michael and Mary and wish them well as they move on to high school.
Congratulations,
Kathy and Kaitlyn

THE QUINNIE TREE







Each year, since 1989, an enormous group of friends would vacation together the first week of August
at a place called Eastover in the Berkshire Mountains near Lenox, Massachusetts, and over the course of the last 20 years, many a memory, many a story and many a laugh were had during this week.
Friendships were forged and families were re-united. The owners of Eastover, Ticki Winsor and her family, became like an extended family over the years and, like all of us, were crushed when they heard of Quinnies death. They immediately donated a free vacation to the May fundraiser and asked if they could “do something special” to memorialize Steve.
During our week’s vacation in August 2006, they planted a beautiful tree and had a wonderful memorial service in Quinnie’s honor.

MEMORY BOOK




Quinnie was definitely one of a kind
creating special memories for each and every person he came across during his wonderful life. To preserve these memories, we ask that you share some of these stories in the space provided below. Ultimately, these stories will be incorporated into a book for Kathleen and Kaitlyn and someday will be passed down to Quinnie’s grandchildren, so they too will get to know how great of a man their grandfather truly was.
A few months after Quinnie passed away, one of his nephews, Mark McNally, began developing a memory book, the contents of which are posted here. Feel free to add your own thoughts, memories and prayers because you know he will be reading them up in heaven, holding an exceptionally frosty can of Coors Light and will be really annoyed if you don’t.










Add a memory
If you would like to contribute your thoughts to the memory book, please cut and paste the following text and email it to Kathleen.

QUINNIE VIDEO







Being one of the most well known and popular people on the planet…
there were literally thousands of pictures of Quinnie.
Mike McCarthy, Mac and Kaitlyn spent countless hours sifting through the photos, picked the best ones and Mike created a video set to music which he presented during the Memorial event.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
