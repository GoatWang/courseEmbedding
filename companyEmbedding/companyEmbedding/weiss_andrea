Product Description:

Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) is a young man with a special talent: he has the power to become anything he wants at any time, be it a doctor, sailor, musician, or scientist. Abducted when he was but a mere child genius by a mysterious organization known only as the Centre, his talents were carefully honed into the veritable shape-shifter he is today. But when Jarod learned that the simulations he created for the Centre are not used for good alone, but sold to the highest bidder for purposes benign or otherwise, he runs away, and sets out to find his long-lost family. Loathe to lose such a heavy investment, the Centre dispatches Sydney (Patrick Bauchau, SECRETARY), who had served as Jarod's father figure and knew him better than anyone. Sydney is aided by Miss Parker (Andrea Parker, LESS THAN PERFECT), the serious-minded daughter of the Center's head honcho, and Broots (Jon Gries, NORTHFORK), a high-strung computer genius. Each episode takes place in a different town, as Jarod tries to right the wrongs he encounters by using his special abilities, while evading his pursuers who are ever close behind. Including all the episodes from season two, this collection sees Jarod and Sydney becoming closer against the wishes of the higher-ups, while Jarod becomes alternately a child psychologist, a fashion photographer, a plastic surgeon, and a member of the SWAT Team.
