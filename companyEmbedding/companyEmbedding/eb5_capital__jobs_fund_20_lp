Welcome to EB5 Capital
 
EB5 Capital owns and operates USCIS-approved EB-5 Regional Centers in Washington, D.C., California, New York, Texas, and Oregon. We raise capital from foreign investors to finance job-creating projects across the United States under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program.
Our clients come from nearly 50 different countries, and all are eligible, along with their families, to become permanent residents of the United States by investing in qualifying U.S. businesses through our Regional Centers.
With nineteen completed and current projects, a 100% I-526 and I-829 project approval rate, and repayments to investors on multiple past projects, we are one of the few EB-5 operators with such an accomplished track record. Our first I-526 approval came in 2008, when there were fewer than 15 Regional Centers in the country.
EB5 Capital’s success comes from working with experienced development partners, using rigorous standards to select projects, and investing in strong real estate markets. Since EB5 Capital was founded in 2007, our mission has been the same: to connect qualified investors with superior job-creating projects that satisfy all of the requirements of the EB-5 Visa Program.
We invite you to explore our site, examine our EB-5 projects, and learn more about what EB5 Capital offers our investors. If you are interested in participating in the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program or would like to learn more about the process, please contact us through our online form and a member of our team will respond within 48 hours. You may also reach out to us directly by phone at +1-202-652-2437 or by email. We look forward to hearing from you!
