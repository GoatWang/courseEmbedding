	Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.




	On June 22, 2017, Huntington announced the release of its company-run capital stress test results as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Results include both Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and Huntington National Bank, and can be found on Huntington’s Investor Relations website on the “Regulatory Disclosures” page under the “Publications and Filings” tab (http://huntington-ir.com/main/Regulatory.htm). Results are based on a forward-looking exercise using hypothetical severely adverse macroeconomic assumptions developed by the Federal Reserve and by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and do not represent Huntington’s economic forecast.




	The Company-run capital stress test results and news release are being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, and the information contained therein shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the Firm under the Securities Act of 1933.




	The information contained or incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations.




	While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; movements in interest rates; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our “Fair Play” banking philosophy; the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and CFPB; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the merger with FirstMerit Corporation are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where we do business; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the merger with FirstMerit Corporation; our ability to complete the integration of FirstMerit Corporation successfully; and other factors that may affect our future results. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available in the “Investor Relations” section of our website,


	http://huntington-ir.com/


	, under the heading “Publications and Filings” and in other documents we file with the SEC.




	All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements.

Unless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, the net
proceeds from the sale of the securities will be added to our general funds and
will be available for general corporate purposes, including, among other things:
     •    the repayment of existing indebtedness,

     •    the repurchase of our common stock,

     •    investments in, or extensions of credit to, our existing or future
          subsidiaries, and

     •    the financing of possible acquisitions.

   Pending such use, we may temporarily invest the net proceeds in short-term
securities or reduce our short-term indebtedness, or we may hold the net
proceeds in deposit accounts in our subsidiary bank.

   Although we continually monitor and investigate suitable acquisition
opportunities, we have no material acquisition commitments, agreements, or
understandings with any specific entities, except as otherwise described or
incorporated by reference in this prospectus.

   Based upon our historical and anticipated future growth and our financial
needs, we may engage in additional financings of a character and amount that we
determine as the need arises.


Competition is intense in most of the markets Huntington serves. Huntington
competes on price and service with other banks and financial services companies
such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, and brokerage
firms. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry
consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from
non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking
reform.


Company Description
Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is a multi-state diversified financial
holding company organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in
Columbus, Ohio. Through our subsidiaries, we are engaged in providing
full-service commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking
services,


 automobile financing, equipment leasing, investment management, trust
services, and discount brokerage services, as well as reinsuring credit life and
disability insurance and selling other insurance and financial products and
services. The Huntington National Bank, organized in 1866, is our only bank
subsidiary.

   Our regional banking offices are located in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia,
Indiana, and Kentucky. Through our affiliated companies, we also offer retail
and commercial financial services online at www.huntington.com; through our
24-hour telephone bank; and through our network of automated teller machines.
Selected financial service activities are also conducted in other states
including: dealer automotive financing services in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee,
Pennsylvania, and Arizona; private financial group offices in Florida; and
mortgage banking offices in Florida, Maryland, and New Jersey. International
banking services are made available through our headquarters office in Columbus
and in our Cayman Islands office and Hong Kong office. Foreign banking
activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant to our
operations.

   As a registered financial holding company, we are subject to the supervision
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. We are required to file
with the Federal Reserve Board reports and other information regarding our
business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries.

   We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and other
subsidiaries. Our principal source of funds to make payments on our securities
is dividends, loan payments, and other funds from our subsidiaries. Various
federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that
our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In
addition, if any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of
that subsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets. Our rights and the rights
of our creditors, including your rights as an owner of our securities, will be
subject to that prior claim, unless we are also a direct creditor of that
subsidiary. The notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in our
annual and quarterly filings with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference
into this prospectus, describe the legal and contractual restrictions on the
ability of our subsidiaries to make payment to us of dividends, loans, or
advances.

	March 6, 2017


	Dear Fellow Shareowners:


	We are pleased to invite you to the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday, April 20, 2017, at our Easton Business Service
	Center in Columbus, Ohio. We will consider the matters described in the following Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and review highlights of the past year. We hope you will attend the meeting.


	Last year proved to be an extraordinary time for Huntington in many ways. We celebrated 150 years of service to customers and communities, and completed
	the largest acquisition in our history. With that acquisition, we welcomed many new and talented colleagues across the markets where we both operated.


	Our team is stronger than ever and committed to delivering the same exceptional customer service that has distinguished Huntington in the past. The hard
	work and dedication of our colleagues allowed us to enter 2017 a stronger Huntington. There is still more work to be done with the integration, and we will continue to invest in colleagues and our focus on being a Welcome brand.


	We added to the composition of our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board regularly reviews the composition
	of the Board to ensure its members represent the strongest knowledge and experience aligned with the Companys business strategy. Notably, the Board appointed Chris Inglis, a renowned cyber-security expert and leader, to serve as a director. We
	further welcome the substantial experience and perspectives that four additional new Board members  former directors of FirstMerit Corporation  have brought to the Board.


	These new directors are Lizabeth Ardisana, Owner and Founder of a technical and communication services firm, ASG Renaissance; Robert S. Cubbin, retired
	President and Chief Executive Officer of Meadowbrook Insurance Group; Gina D. France, President and Chief Executive Officer of France Strategic Partners LLC, a strategy and transactional advisory firm; and J. Michael Hochschwender, President and
	Chief Executive Officer of The Smithers Group, a private group of companies that provide technology-based services to a global clientele in a broad range of industries. We are delighted to welcome our new members of the Board. The Board extends
	enormous gratitude to John B. (Jay) Gerlach, Jr. who will be stepping down from the Board after 18 years of extraordinary service as a Director, as well as the long-term chair of our Compensation Committee.


	The Board of Directors recognizes the importance of risk management and has set a strong tone at the top. The Board monitors the Companys adherence
	to the Boards established aggregate


	moderate-to-low


	risk appetite chiefly through its committee structure. In addition, the Board continually evaluates our
	corporate governance as best practices evolve and appreciates the perspectives of our shareholders. The Proxy Statement provides additional detail on our corporate governance, including on the composition of our Board of Directors, the role of the
	Board committees, and the Boards role in risk oversight.


	We are focused on growing the organization and improving performance, enhancing our
	customer and colleagues experience and proactively managing risk, all with a view of long-term consistent performance.


	Your vote is important to us.
	Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we encourage you to read the Proxy Statement carefully. Please vote via internet, telephone or mail to ensure that your shares are represented.


	Thank you for your support of Huntington.


	Best wishes,

	Executive Compensation Highlights







	 


	We believe our compensation philosophy and programs for executives are balanced and risk appropriate, demonstrate long-term
	alignment with long-term sustained performance and shareholder interests, and provide a competitive and effective program to attract, motivate and retain the best talent. This is supported by the following leading market practices incorporated into
	our program:


	 


	  We require that
	executives own a significant amount of company stock and hold a significant portion of the net shares earned until retirement


	 


	  Any above target payments from our annual incentive program are paid in restricted stock units that vest over
	3 years


	 


	  50% of our annual
	long-term incentive awards for named executives only vest to the extent performance criteria have been achieved or exceeded


	 


	  We use a broad, diverse group of incentive metrics in both our annual and long-term incentive programs


	 


	  We have a Recoupment / Clawback Policy
	applicable to all incentive compensation for all employees


	 


	  Our Executive Agreements are
	double-trigger





	 










	Governance Highlights







	 


	Our board of directors has established strong governance.


	 


	  Our board of directors represents a well-rounded variety of skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives


	 


	  Directors are elected annually with a
	majority voting standard


	 


	  We have an
	independent and engaged Lead Director


	 


	  A majority of our directors are independent, and key committees are comprised of independent
	directors

	PROXY STATEMENT



	We are providing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland
	corporation (we, us, our, the company or Huntington), of proxies to be voted at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders to be held on April 20, 2017, and at any adjournment. We are
	sending or making this proxy statement available to our shareholders on or about March 9, 2017.





	General Information about the Meeting





	Voting Procedures




	Holders of
	common stock at the close of business on February 15, 2017, are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. As of that date, there were 1,090,179,467 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock,
	Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote.


	Each holder of common stock is entitled to
	cast one vote on each matter submitted at the annual meeting for each share of stock held of record at the close of business on February 15, 2017. The shares represented by a properly submitted proxy will be voted as directed provided we
	receive the proxy prior to or at the meeting. A properly executed proxy without specific voting instructions will be voted FOR Proposal 1  Election of Directors, FOR Proposal 2  Ratification of the Appointment of
	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, FOR Proposal 3  Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation, and with respect to Proposal 4  Advisory Recommendation on the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes on
	Executive Compensation  for a frequency of EVERY year. A properly submitted proxy will also confer discretionary authority to vote on any other matter which may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of
	the meeting.


	You may vote by executing and returning your proxy card in the envelope provided, or by voting electronically over the Internet or by
	telephone. Please refer to the proxy card for information on voting electronically. If you attend the meeting, you may vote in person and the proxy will not be used.


	We are not currently aware of any matters that may properly be presented other than those described in this proxy statement. If any matters not described
	in the proxy statement are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. If the meeting is adjourned, the proxies can vote your common stock at the adjournment as well, unless you
	have revoked your proxy instructions.




	Revoking Your Proxy




	If your common stock is held in street name, you must follow the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions.
	If you are a holder of record and wish to revoke your proxy instructions, you must advise our secretary in writing before the proxies vote your common stock at the meeting, deliver later dated proxy instructions, or attend the meeting and vote your
	shares in person.




	Expenses of Solicitation




	We will pay the expenses of this proxy solicitation, including the reasonable charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding
	solicitation material to their customers who are beneficial owners. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail and via the Internet, our employees may also solicit proxies by telephone and in person. We have retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave.,
	Stamford, CT 06902, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $10,000 plus reimbursement of expenses.




	Vote Required




	A quorum is required to conduct business at the annual meeting. Shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the
	annual meeting, present in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum. Proposal 1: a nominee for election to the board of directors at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present will be elected only if the number of votes cast
	for such nominees election exceeds the total number of votes cast against or affirmatively withheld as to such nominees election; provided, however, that if, on either the date of the companys
	proxy statement for the meeting or on the date of the meeting, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the meeting. Proposals 2 and 3: each requires
	the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast on the matter by the holders of common stock at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Proposal 4: the option of one year, two years or three years that receives a majority of all the votes cast
	at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be the frequency of the advisory vote recommended by shareholders. In the event that no option receives a majority of the votes cast, we will consider the option that receives the most votes to be the
	option selected by the shareholders.

	Under the laws of Maryland, our state of incorporation, abstentions and broker

	non-votes

	are counted for purposes
	of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but are not counted as votes cast at the meeting. Broker

	non-votes

	occur when brokers who hold their customers shares in street name submit proxies for
	such shares on some matters, but not others. Generally, this would occur when brokers have not received any instructions from their customers. In these cases, the brokers, as the holders of record, are permitted to vote on routine
	matters, which typically include the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm, but not on

	non-routine

	matters. Brokers are no longer permitted to vote on the election of directors or
	on matters related to executive compensation without instructions from their customers. Broker

	non-votes

	and abstentions will have no effect on the election of any director or the approval of the other matters
	described above since they are not counted as votes cast at the meeting, but votes affirmatively withheld from the election of any nominee will have the effect of a vote against that nominees election as a director.




	Board Recommendation




	The board of
	directors recommends that you vote


	FOR


	all of the director nominees,


	FOR


	proposals 2 and 3, and


	FOR


	the proposal to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation


	EVERY




	YEAR

	Corporate Governance







	Corporate Governance Guidelines, Policies and Procedures




	Our board of directors has a corporate governance program which includes
	Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all of our employees and, where applicable, to our directors, and to employees and directors of our affiliates. Our
	employees serving as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, corporate controller, and principal accounting officer are also bound by a Financial Code of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers. The Corporate
	Governance Guidelines, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Financial Code of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers are posted on the Investor Relations pages of Huntingtons website at

	www.huntington.com.







	Board Meetings and Committee Information




	The board of directors held a total of 15 regular and special meetings in 2016. We believe that regular attendance at meetings is of utmost importance,
	and we encourage our directors to attend the annual shareholders meetings and at least 75% of all regularly scheduled board and committee meetings. During 2016, each director attended greater than 75% of the meetings of the full board of directors
	and the committees on which he or she served. All directors then serving attended the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders.


	Our board of directors
	has eight standing committees of the board: Audit, Community Development, Compensation, Executive, Huntington Investment Company Oversight, Nominating and Corporate Governance, Risk Oversight, and Technology. From time to time the board of directors
	may appoint ad hoc committees. The Integration Oversight Committee was established in February 2016 as an ad hoc committee to assist the board in the oversight of the integration of people, systems, and processes of FirstMerit Corporation with
	Huntington.

	All board members have access to all committee reports and materials. In addition, all board members
	are welcome to attend any meetings of the standing committees. Each standing committee has a separate written charter. Current copies of the committee charters are posted on the Investor Relations pages of our website at

	Richard W. Neu (Chair)




	Ann B. Crane

	Meetings Held in 2016



	:





	10







	 



	(includes 5 held jointly with the Risk Oversight Committee)





	 




	 



	The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial
	statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also provides assistance to
	the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications, performance and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior
	financial officers; and compliance with corporate securities trading policies.



	 



	While the Audit Committee has the duties and responsibilities set forth above and as set forth in its charter, our management is responsible for the internal
	controls and the financial reporting process, and the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with
	generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report thereon.



	 



	The Audit
	Committee periodically meets in joint session with the Risk Oversight Committee to cover matters relevant to both, such as the capital plan and the construct and appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed
	quarterly.



	 



	The board of directors has determined that each of Richard W. Neu,
	chairman of the Audit Committee, Gina D. France and Eddie R. Munson qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as the term is defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This designation does not impose
	any duties, obligations or liabilities on them that are greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on the other members of the Audit Committee. Each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an independent director as
	the term is defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules.





	  















	Report of the Audit Committee







	The primary responsibility of the Audit Committee is to oversee the integrity of Huntingtons consolidated financial statements. In carrying
	out its duties, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 with Huntington management and with Huntingtons independent registered public accounting
	firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. This discussion included the selection, application and disclosure of critical accounting policies, as well as the firms views on fraud risks and how it demonstrates its independence and skepticism. The Audit
	Committee has also reviewed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of Huntingtons accounting principles and such other matters required to be discussed under auditing standards generally
	accepted in the United States, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees.




	The Audit Committee has reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3526 regarding PricewaterhouseCoopers
	LLPs communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from Huntington. Based on this review and discussion, and a review of the services provided by
	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during 2016, the Audit Committee believes that the services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2016 are compatible with, and do not impair, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs independence.

	Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that
	the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Huntingtons Annual Report on Form

	The Compensation Committee fulfills the duties and responsibilities of the
	board as it relates to executive and director compensation matters. In carrying out its duties, the committee reviews and approves Huntingtons goals and objectives with respect to the compensation of the chief executive officer and other
	executive management. The Compensation Committee also evaluates the performance of the chief executive officer and other executive management in light of such goals and objectives, and sets their compensation levels based on such evaluation. The
	Compensation Committee advises the board of directors with respect to compensation for service by

	non-employee

	directors on the board of directors and its committees. The Compensation Committee also makes
	recommendations to the board of directors with respect to Huntingtons incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans, oversees the activities of the individuals and committees responsible for administering these plans, and discharges any
	responsibility imposed on the Compensation Committee by any of these plans. In addition, the Compensation Committee assists the board of directors in fulfillment of the duties and responsibilities delegated to the board under our retirement
	plans.





	  














	Procedures for Determining Executive and Director Compensation; Compensation Consultant






	The Compensation Committee has the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its duties and responsibilities. This includes authority to
	select, retain, terminate and approve fees and other retention terms of advisors, including legal counsel and other advisors. The Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, an independent consulting firm, to provide
	advisory services related to executive and director compensation. The individual consultant managing the relationship with Huntington (the compensation consultant) reports directly to the Compensation Committee, and is evaluated by the Compensation
	Committee on an annual basis.




	The compensation consultant is available as needed for expert guidance and support, provides updates on
	emerging trends and best practices, and frequently attends meetings of the Compensation Committee. Services provided by the compensation consultant during 2016 included review of our selected peer group, benchmarking compensation and performance,
	and establishing total compensation guidelines, including targets for short and long-term incentive plans, and modeling payouts under various performance scenarios. During 2016 the compensation consultant did not provide any services other than
	advice and recommendations related to executive and director compensation.




	The Compensation Committee has received representations from
	the compensation consultant with respect to independence, including with respect to: the fees received by the consulting firm from Huntington as a percentage of total revenue of the consulting firm; the policies or procedures maintained by the
	consulting firm designed to prevent a conflict of interest; any business or personal relationship between the compensation consultant and any Compensation Committee member; any business or personal relationship between the compensation consultant
	and executive officers of Huntington; and any Huntington stock owned by the compensation consultant. Based on review of these representations and the services provided by the compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee has determined that
	the compensation consultant is independent and that the consultants work has not created any conflicts of interest.




	Although the
	Compensation Committee makes independent determinations on all matters related to compensation of executive officers, certain members of management are requested to attend committee meetings and provide input to the Compensation Committee. Input may
	be sought from the chief executive officer, Human Resources, Finance, and Risk Management colleagues and others as needed to ensure the Compensation Committee has the information and

	Table of Contents



	perspective it needs to carry out its duties. In particular, the Compensation Committee will seek input from the chief executive officer on matters relating to strategic objectives, company
	performance goals and input on his assessment of the other executive officers. The Committee also receives regular updates from the chief risk officer and chief financial officer throughout the year as appropriate. Representatives of Human Resources
	work with the Chair of the Compensation Committee to ensure he has the background, information and data needed to facilitate meetings.


	The
	Compensation Committee meets with representatives of the Audit Committee as appropriate in making determinations. The Audit Committee chair attends the meetings at which the Compensation Committee certifies company performance against the
	established incentive plan performance goals.


	The Compensation Committee takes risk into account when determining compensation and has developed an
	executive compensation philosophy that balances risk and reward with a mix of base pay, short-term incentives and long-term incentives, with greater emphasis on long-term incentives. The Compensation Committees role in the oversight of
	incentive compensation risk is discussed under The Boards Role in Risk Oversight, below.


	The Compensation Committee may delegate
	all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee, or in accordance with the terms of a particular compensation plan, to a management committee. The Compensation Committee delegates some
	responsibilities to management to assist in development of design considerations, with permission to work with the Committees compensation consultant to develop proposals for the Committees consideration. The Compensation Committee may
	not, however, delegate the determination of compensation for executive officers to management. From time to time, the Compensation Committee may obtain the approval of the board of directors with respect to certain executive and director
	compensation matters.




	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation.


	We have no compensation committee interlocks. In
	addition, no member of the Compensation Committee has served as one of our officers or employees.








	Report of the Compensation Committee

	Director Nomination and Board Evaluation






	Our board of directors is committed to maintaining a well-rounded and effective board aligned with the companys business strategy. At least
	annually the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the composition of the board to assure that the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience are represented, in the Committees judgment, and in order to comply with applicable
	laws and regulations.




	The full board of directors performs a self-evaluation each year, overseen by the Nominating and Corporate
	Governance Committee. The lead director, as chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, solicits comments and recommendations from the directors through a series of questions which provide a frame-work for discussion. Although
	the specific questions may vary from


	year-to-year,


	the topics generally include the substance and efficiency of board and committee meetings and materials, utilization
	of skills and committee appointments, skills and experience needed for the board, and board engagement and interaction, and have an emphasis on the boards responsibility for oversight of risk management. The lead director provides a
	report to the board in executive session summarizing the feedback. Each committee of the board also performs an annual self-evaluation and reports the findings to the full board of directors.








	Skills, Knowledge, Experience and Perspectives






	Our directors embody a well-rounded variety of skills, knowledge, and experience, as demonstrated in the chart below. The board also benefits from directors having a range of tenures as this provides continuity as
	well as fresh perspective.

	The board believes that one of its most important responsibilities is identifying, evaluating and selecting
	candidates for the board. Board members are encouraged to identify prospective directors and recommend them to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the qualifications of

	Table of Contents




	potential director candidates and makes recommendations to the full board. The factors considered by the Committee and the board in their review of potential candidates include whether the
	candidate:



	 





	 




	




	 





	has exhibited behavior that indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical standards;






	 





	 




	




	 





	has special skills, expertise and background that would complement the attributes of the existing directors, taking into consideration the diverse communities
	and geographies in which the company operates;






	 





	 




	




	 





	has achieved prominence in his or her business, governmental or professional activities, and has built a reputation that demonstrates the ability to make the
	kind of important and sensitive judgments that the board is called upon to make;






	 





	 




	




	 





	possesses a willingness to challenge management while working constructively as part of a team in an environment of trust; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	will be able to devote sufficient time and energy to the performance of his or her duties as a director.







	The board also believes that board membership should reflect the diversity of the markets in which we do business. From time to time the Nominating
	and Corporate Governance Committee will identify additional selection criteria for board membership, taking into consideration the companys business strategy, the business environment and current board composition. At this time, there are no
	other specific additional criteria.






	Recommendations for Director Candidates






	Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by sending a written notice to
	the Secretary at Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Huntington Center, 41 South High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43287. The notice should indicate the name, age, and address of the person recommended, the persons principal occupation or employment
	for the last five years, other public company boards on which the person serves, whether the person would qualify as independent as the term is defined under the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the class and number of shares of
	Huntington securities owned by the person. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may require additional information to determine the qualifications of the person recommended. The notice should also state the name and address of, and the
	class and number of shares of our securities owned by, the person or persons making the recommendation. There have been no material changes to the shareholder recommendation process since we last disclosed this item.








	Independence of Directors






	Our board of directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have reviewed and evaluated transactions and relationships with board members to determine the independence of each of the members. The
	board of directors does not believe that any of its

	non-employee

	members has relationships with us that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as
	director. Further, the board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have determined that a majority of the boards members are independent directors as the term is defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules.
	The directors determined to be independent under this definition are: Lizabeth Ardisana, Ann B. Crane, Robert S. Cubbin, Steven G. Elliott, Gina D. France, John B. Gerlach, Jr., J. Michael Hochschwender, Chris Inglis, Peter J. Kight, Jonathan A.
	Levy, Eddie R. Munson, Richard W. Neu, David L. Porteous, and Kathleen H. Ransier. The board of directors has determined that each member of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees is independent under such
	definition and that the members of the Audit Committee are independent under the additional, more stringent requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market applicable to audit committee members.




	In making the independence determinations for each of the directors, the board took into consideration the transactions disclosed in this proxy
	statement under Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons below. In addition, the board of directors considered that the directors and their family members are customers of our affiliated financial and lending
	institutions. Many of the directors have one or more transactions, relationships or arrangements where Huntingtons affiliated financial and lending institutions, in the ordinary course of business, act as depository of funds, lender or
	trustee, or provide similar services. Directors may also be affiliated with entities which are customers of our affiliated financial and lending institutions and which enter into transactions with such affiliates in the ordinary course of business.
	The board also considered charitable donations to organizations in which directors have an interest, and the following relationships and transactions, and determined them to be immaterial: routine transactions and relationships entered into in the
	ordinary course of business between the Bank and business organizations with which Mr. Gerlach and Ms. Ransier, respectively, have an interest.

	The Boards Leadership Structure






	Our chief executive officer, Stephen D. Steinour, serves as chairman of the board. Director David L. Porteous has served as independent lead
	director since the board created the position in November 2007. The board believes that having a combined chief executive officer and chairman along with a strong independent lead director provides an efficient and effective leadership structure.




	The specific responsibilities of the lead director are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which include:



	 





	 




	




	 





	serving as liaison between the chairman of the board and the outside directors;






	 





	 




	




	 





	consulting with the chairman of the board on information sent to the board;






	 





	 




	




	 





	reviewing and providing input to the chairman of the board on board meeting agendas;






	 





	 




	




	 





	consulting with the chairman of the board on meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;






	 





	 




	




	 





	presiding at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the outside directors;






	 





	 




	




	 





	having the authority to call meetings of the outside directors; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	ensuring that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication with key stakeholders, if requested by the chief executive officer.







	Mr. Porteous performs these duties and provides leadership in numerous additional ways. He is available to the
	chief executive officer as a sounding board for a variety of matters. He meets regularly with Huntingtons regulators. He promotes good governance and fosters dialogue among the directors and between the board and management. Mr. Porteous
	also takes an active role in outreach efforts with various constituents, including Huntington employees. He regularly engages with the employees and acts as a liaison between employees and the board.




	The board believes that having an independent lead director performing these duties effectively complements and counterbalances the role of the
	combined chairman / chief executive officer. The interaction of the roles of the chairman / chief executive officer and the lead director is reflected in the table below.

	Has authority to engage advisors and consultants who report directly to the board of directors on
	board issues







	In addition to having an engaged lead director, additional factors contribute to the boards comfort with
	Mr. Steinour serving in the combined roles of chairman and chief executive officer. These factors include our strong corporate governance practices, our boards independence, and the accountability of the chief executive officer to the
	board. Executive sessions, excluding the chairman and chief executive officer, are held in conjunction with each regularly scheduled board meeting to ensure open dialogue with the lead director. Moreover, there is regular reporting by senior
	management to the board of directors as further described under The Boards Role in Risk Oversight below. The board has also considered our leadership structure in light of the companys size, the nature of its business, the
	regulatory framework in which it operates, and its peers and determined that the boards leadership structure is appropriate for our company at this time.








	The Boards Role in Risk Oversight






	The board of
	directors has defined our risk appetite as aggregate


	moderate-to-low


	and has established a comprehensive and coordinated risk oversight structure. While the board has
	three board committees that primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and the monitoring of our risk profile  the Risk Oversight Committee, Audit Committee and the Technology Committee  the full
	board is engaged in discussing all risks. The board of directors receives regular reports from every board committee. Noteworthy issues from each committee agenda are called to the attention of the full board in advance. In addition, all directors
	have access to information provided to each committee, and all scheduled committee meetings are open to all directors. The directors regularly communicate directly with members of senior management as well as among the board and board committees.





	Board Committees





	The Risk Oversight Committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks, and the approval and monitoring of the
	companys capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate


	moderate-to-low


	risk profile; the risk governance structure; compliance with applicable laws
	and regulations; and determining adherence to the boards stated risk appetite. The Committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks: market, credit, liquidity, legal, compliance/regulatory, operational,
	strategic and reputational. This Committee also oversees our capital management and planning process, and ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks and that our capital levels exceed
	well-capitalized requirements. The Risk Oversight Committee receives reports directly from the chief risk office at least quarterly.

	Table of Contents



	The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies,
	procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the
	internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; and compliance with
	corporate securities trading policies. The chief internal auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee.


	The Risk Oversight and Audit Committees
	routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management. On a regular basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both.


	The Technology Committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology, cyber security and
	third party risk management strategies and plans. The committee is charged with evaluating Huntingtons capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan, including projected growth, technology capacity,
	planning, operational execution, product development, and management capacity. The committee provides oversight of the technology segment investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk, security, and
	redundancy. The Committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors. The Technology Committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the Companys
	strategic plans, including monitoring of overall industry trends. The Technology Committee reviews and provides oversight of the companys continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparedness. The chief technology officer and the chief
	information officer regularly attend meetings of the Technology Committee.


	Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks
	to ensure its system of rewards is risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. The Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates the companys compensation policies and practices and the relationship among
	risk, risk management and compensation to ensure that incentive compensation practices appropriately balance risk and financial results, incentives do not expose the company to imprudent risks, the incentive programs are compatible with effective
	controls and risk management, are supported by strong corporate governance and the compensation policies are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. The Compensation Committee meets regularly with members of senior management,
	including the chief risk officer and the chief financial officer.


	Through the Community Development Committee, the board oversees the companys
	compliance with fair lending obligations and Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAAP) standards. The Community Development Committee has primary oversight of the companys commitments to the Community Reinvestment Act and the
	companys commitment to create and maintain a culture of inclusion that leverages diversity effectively. Senior compliance officers and the chief diversity and inclusion officer regularly participate in meetings of the Community Development
	Committee.


	The role of each of the board committees is further described above.



	Company Strategy and Leadership



	The full
	board of directors focuses direct oversight on risks related to company strategy and leadership. The board holds an

	off-site

	session each year devoted to review of strategic priorities. In addition, the CEO
	reserves time at the beginning of each board meeting to discuss priorities. Periodically, special board sessions are held to discuss and analyze specific possible risk scenarios, such as cybersecurity incidents.


	The full board of directors oversees succession planning for the positions of the CEO and other members of the executive leadership team. As selecting
	and appointing qualified executive leadership for the company is a priority for the board of directors, succession planning is discussed frequently. At least annually, the CEO and the chief human resources officer review with the board the
	succession plans in place for executive leadership. Management also maintains succession plans for the positions reporting to the executive leadership team, and their direct reports.



	Continual Director Education



	Huntington has
	established a formal training program for the board of directors to assist the board in its risk oversight function. The training program, which is overseen by the chief risk officer, covers:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) issues;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Fair lending responsibilities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Avoidance of UDAAP (Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices);




	 




	 


	


	 


	Cyber risks and breaches; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Legal, regulatory and supervisory requirements and trends applicable to Huntington.




	 


	13







	Table of Contents



	Additional topics may be included as appropriate, related to complex products, services or lines of
	business that have the potential to significantly impact the company and other topics as identified by the board of directors or executive management from time to time.


	In addition, all board members are encouraged to participate in relevant external director education opportunities. Insights gained from these programs
	are shared with the full board of directors. In 2016, 6 directors attended conferences or seminars totaling approximately 125 hours of instruction.



	Risk Assessment of Incentive Compensation



	The Compensation Committee oversees the companys compensation policies and practices and the relationship among risk, risk management and
	compensation. The Compensation Committees oversight is supported by the Incentive Compensation Oversight Committee (the Oversight Committee), an executive level management committee. The Oversight Committee consists of senior
	management from Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Credit Administration, and Risk Management, and is

	co-chaired

	by the chief risk officer and the chief human resources officer. The Oversight Committee reports
	directly to the Compensation Committee.


	Under the direction of the Oversight Committee, Huntington performs an annual risk assessment of each
	incentive plan. The review includes economic analysis as well as evaluation of plan design features, risk balancing mechanisms, and governance policies and practices. A key tool for managing incentive compensation risk is an annual
	enterprise-level significant risk events review process overseen by the chief risk officer and the chief credit officer. This

	year-end

	significant risk events review typically results in a number of incentive
	payment adjustments, including several with respect to 2016 incentives.


	Huntington uses a variety of plan design features to balance risk and
	rewards. Governance policies and practices also play an important role in managing incentive plan risk. We regularly monitor our incentive compensation arrangements for employees at all levels and strive to enhance our risk review in light of
	developing best practices and regulatory guidance.


	 















	 


	Key broad-based incentive plan design features & controls include:


	 



	  



	 


	Other features and controls used in various plans include:






	  Recoupment / clawback provisions


	 



	  



	  Multiple performance
	criteria






	  Management discretion to reduce or
	eliminate awards


	 



	  



	  Risk-related performance
	criteria






	  Annual risk-based review of plans
	and awards


	 



	  



	  Payment caps





	 


	  



	  Hold-until-retirement or other termination provisions for equity grants


	 






	For executive officers, our compensation philosophy balances risk and reward with a mix of base pay, short-term
	incentives and long-term incentives, with greater emphasis on long-term incentives. We maintain stock ownership guidelines for executives and impose a hold until retirement requirement of up to 50% of the net shares. See
	Compensation of Executive Officers below for detail about our executive compensation philosophy and programs.






	Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons




	The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of
	directors oversees our Related Party Transactions Review and Approval Policy, referred to as the Policy. This written Policy covers related party transactions, including any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship or any
	series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, either currently proposed or since the beginning of the last fiscal year in which we were or will be a participant, involving an amount exceeding $120,000 and in which a director,
	nominee for director, executive officer or his or her immediate family member has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The Policy requires our senior management and directors to notify the general counsel of any existing or potential
	related party transactions. Our general counsel reviews each reported transaction, arrangement or relationship that constitutes a related party transaction with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The
	Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines whether or not related party transactions are fair and reasonable for us. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also determines whether any related party
	transaction in which a director has an interest impairs the directors independence. Approved related party transactions are subject to

	on-going

	review by our management on at least an
	annual basis. Loans to directors and executive officers and their related interests made and approved pursuant to the terms of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O are deemed to be approved under this Policy. Any of these loans that become subject to
	specific disclosure in our annual proxy statement are reviewed by the Nominating

	Table of Contents




	and Corporate Governance Committee at that time. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would also consider and review any transactions with a shareholder having beneficial ownership
	of more than 5% of Huntingtons voting securities in accordance with the Policy.






	Indebtedness of Management.


	Many of
	our directors and executive officers and their immediate family members are customers of our affiliated financial and lending institutions in the ordinary course of business. In addition, our directors and executive officers also may be affiliated
	with entities which are customers of our affiliated financial and lending institutions in the ordinary course of business. Loan transactions with directors, executive officers and their immediate family members and affiliates have been made on
	substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers otherwise not affiliated with us. Such loans also have not involved more than the normal risk of
	collectability or presented other unfavorable features.






	Certain Other Transactions.


	One of our subsidiaries, Huntington
	Mezzanine Opportunities Inc., established in 2002 a private corporate mezzanine investment fund to provide financing in transaction amounts of up to $10 million to assist middle market companies primarily in the Midwest with growth or
	acquisition strategies. The investment fund was dissolved in 2014. Stonehenge Mezzanine Partners LLC, as its sole purpose, served as the asset manager of the fund through May 2014. After June 1, 2014 Stonehenge Mezzanine Partners LLC was
	entitled to receive 19.315% of amounts collected from any

	earn-out

	payments, escrow payments or other similar contingent payments related to other previous investments that had been held by the fund. During
	2016, Stonehenge Mezzanine Partners LLC received $19,098 from

	earn-out/escrow

	payments/contingent payments. Our director Michael J. Endres has a 12.6% equity interest in Stonehenge Mezzanine Partners LLC.




	The Huntington National Bank has a $7.85 million commitment (reduced from $10 million) for an equity investment in the Stonehenge
	Opportunity Fund II, LP, a $150 million investment fund, which was organized in 2004. This funds origination period ended in 2010. As of December 31, 2016, $6.36 million of the $7.85 million commitment has been funded. The
	remaining $1.49 million commitment is limited to fund

	follow-on

	investments in existing portfolio companies and fund expenses. The Huntington National Bank also has a $10 million commitment for an
	equity investment in the Stonehenge Opportunity Fund III, LP, a $250 million investment fund, which was organized in 2010, and a $15 million commitment for an equity investment in the Stonehenge Opportunity Fund IV, LP, a $250 million
	investment fund, which was organized in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, $7.2 million of the $10 million commitment to Stonehenge Opportunity Fund III, LP and $1 million of the $15 million commitment to Stonehenge Opportunity
	Fund IV, LP have been funded.




	The Stonehenge Opportunity Fund II, LP, the Stonehenge Opportunity Fund III, LP, and the Stonehenge
	Opportunity Fund IV, LP each operate as a Small Business Investment Company licensed by the Small Business Administration. Each of these funds seeks to generate long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity and, in certain cases,
	mezzanine securities of a diverse portfolio of companies across a variety of industries. Our management determined that the investment would provide a cost effective means to participate in financing small businesses, provide a means of obtaining
	lending or investment credits under the Community Reinvestment Act and generally be favorable to us. Each of the funds is managed by Stonehenge Partners Corp., an investment firm of which Michael J. Endres is a principal and holds a 9.8% equity
	interest. These funds pay to Stonehenge Partners Corp. management fees not to exceed on an annual basis 2.00% of the aggregate of private capital commitments and Small Business Administration debentures of the respective fund. In addition,
	Stonehenge Partners Corp. is the controlling entity of Stonehenge Equity Partners, LLC, which serves as managing member of each of the funds.




	Paul McMahon has been employed by The Huntington National Bank since 2006 and currently serves as a Portfolio Manager  Team Lead in the Commercial Banking Department. Mr. McMahon is the


	son-in-law


	of director David L. Porteous. Mr. McMahon serves in a

	non-executive

	capacity four reporting levels below the
	Commercial Banking Director, is one of approximately 16,500 employees, and is compensated in accordance with the employment compensation practices and policies applicable to all employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities in
	similar positions. For 2016, Mr. McMahon received compensation of approximately $156,000 including base salary and incentive compensation, as well as benefits generally available to all employees.







	Compensation of Outside Directors





	Our compensation philosophy for the board of directors is to provide a compensation arrangement to outside directors that reflects the significant time commitment and substantial contributions the directors are
	expected to make to the value creation and governance of Huntington. Our compensation level and structure are designed to enable us to attract and retain high caliber talent at a national level, and also to align the directors interests with
	those of the shareholders. Our compensation program for

	non-employee

	directors is a combination of cash and equity. Directors who are also employees of Huntington do not receive compensation for their services
	as directors.

	Fees Payable in Cash.


	Each

	non-employee

	director
	earns an annual retainer of $35,000. We pay an additional annual retainer of $65,000 to the lead director, and $20,000 to the chairs of all standing board committees. We pay meeting fees at the standard rate of $2,000 for each board of directors or
	committee meeting the director attends and $1,000 for each teleconference board of directors or committee meeting in which the director participates. In addition, we pay directors fees of $2,000 per day in the event Huntington requests a director to
	attend or participate in an event or meeting, in person, in his capacity as a director. All fees are payable quarterly. Retainer fees are payable in four equal quarterly installments. A director may defer all or a portion of the cash compensation
	payable to the director if he or she elects to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust for Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Directors, referred to as the Directors Deferred Plan. The trustee of the plan has typically invested the
	trust fund primarily in shares of our common stock. The Directors Deferred Plan is described below.






	Equity Compensation.


	To align the interests of directors with shareholders, a meaningful portion of director compensation is paid in equity that is subject to holding requirements. The Compensation Committee considers equity grants for

	non-employee

	directors on an annual basis, and the form and amounts of any equity grants for directors are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Since 2006, the equity grants for
	directors have been in the form of deferred stock units which are vested upon grant but not released to the director until six months following separation of service. Based on the market data and peer review facilitated by the independent
	compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee granted each

	non-employee

	director a deferred stock award having a value of $105,000, effective May 1, 2016. Divided by the stock price of $10.06 on the
	last trading day preceding the date of grant, each director was awarded 10,437 deferred stock units, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Compensation Committee awarded an additional $20,000 grant value to the chairpersons of the Audit,
	Compensation and Risk Oversight Committees which converted to an additional 1,988 deferred stock units.




	In addition to the mandated
	holding of shares imposed by the deferred stock units, the Compensation Committee has established a minimum ownership level guideline for directors based on five times the annual retainer fee (excluding committee chairmanship retainers). Based on
	the retainer fee and the fair market value of our common stock on the date the guidelines were established, the guideline for directors was set at 40,603 shares. Directors have five years to meet the minimum guidelines, from the date the guidelines
	were established, or if later, the date of joining the board. Each of the directors who has served at least two years has met the guidelines.

	Directors Deferred Plan



	.

	The Directors Deferred Plan allows the members of the board to elect
	to defer receipt of all or a portion of the compensation payable to them in the future for services as directors. We transfer cash equal to the compensation deferred pursuant to the plan to a trust fund where it is allocated to the accounts of the
	participating directors. The trustee of the plan has broad investment discretion over the trust fund and is authorized to invest in many forms of securities and other instruments, including our common stock. During 2016, the trustee invested
	primarily in shares of our common stock.




	A directors account will be distributed either in a lump sum or in equal annual
	installments over a period of not more than ten years, as elected by each director. Distribution will commence upon the earlier of 30 days after the attainment of an age specified by the director at the time the deferral election was made, or within
	30 days of the directors termination as a director. All of the assets of the plan including the assets of the trust fund are subject to the claims of our creditors. The rights of a director or his or her beneficiaries to any of the assets of
	the plan are no greater than the rights of our unsecured general creditors. Since directors who are also our employees do not receive compensation as directors, they are not eligible to participate in this plan.




	As of December 31, 2016, the participating directors accounts were substantially comprised of Huntington common stock and had the values
	set forth in the table below.

	Compensation of Executive Officers








	Compensation Discussion & Analysis





	This Compensation Discussion & Analysis describes Huntingtons executive compensation program for 2016 for our named executive officers
	(NEOs) whose compensation is detailed in the Summary Compensation Table which follows. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors provides independent oversight of our executive compensation and has engaged an independent compensation
	consultant, Pearl Meyer & Partners LLC, to provide advice with respect to the amount and form of executive compensation.


	Our compensation
	philosophy is to pay for performance that creates long-term shareholder value. The Compensation Committee has developed a balanced compensation program for executives that incorporates many key compensation and governance practices.


	 
















	Key
	Compensation & Governance Practices








	✓




	 


	Significant stock ownership and hold until retirement policies that reinforce alignment between shareholders and executive officers






	✓




	 


	Significant emphasis on performance-based compensation, with majority of compensation dependent upon long-term performance






	✓




	 


	Balanced portfolio of metrics that drive annual and long-term goals in a risk appropriate manner






	✓




	 


	Annual cash incentive awards for executive officers  cash is capped at 100% of target; any award above target is paid in RSUs with a 3 year ratable vesting
	period






	✓




	 


	All incentive compensation subject to Recoupment and Clawback Policy






	✓




	 


	Performance Share Units comprise 50% of total annual LTI grant value






	✓




	 


	Hedging by executives is prohibited and pledging by executives and directors is restricted and discouraged; no shares are currently pledged






	✓




	 


	Independent compensation consultant advising the Compensation Committee





	

	Doing the Right Thing

	. The Compensation Committee also oversees the companys broader
	compensation policies and practices and the relationship among risk takers, risk management and compensation. Huntington regularly monitors its incentive arrangements for employees at all levels and strives to enhance incentive risk management in
	light of developing best practices and regulatory guidance. Risk assessment of incentive compensation is discussed in greater detail above under The Boards Role in Risk Oversight.


	For years we have worked hard to build a culture of doing the right thing for our customers. Our fair play banking philosophy starts with
	doing the right thing with products and services that are simple, clear, and fair. We also look to deepen existing customer relationships by working to understand and serve our customers needs. We have a proud legacy of strong customer service
	and we require that all of our colleagues follow both the letter and intent of our code of business conduct and ethics. We take action when we find violations of our code of conduct, and violations are reported to the audit committee of the board of
	directors.


	Moreover, Huntington maintains a robust Recoupment and Clawback Policy which is a tool for recoupment or clawback of incentive
	compensation in appropriate situations. Employees at all levels in the organization are subject to this


	 


	20







	Table of Contents



	policy. Incentive compensation subject to possible clawback or recoupment includes any cash incentive or equity compensation, vested or unvested. In general, situations that trigger a review
	under this policy involve behaviors or actions outside the bounds of the companys overall risk appetite and governance structure. The Compensation Committee would make any incentive recoupment or clawback determination with respect to
	executive officers. Additional detail about the Recoupment and Clawback Policy can be found later in this discussion.



	The Importance of Stock
	Ownership

	. A critical foundation of our executive compensation philosophy is the requirement to own Huntington common stock, which aligns managements interests with those of shareholders. Mr. Steinours commitment to this
	principle and to the company is evidenced by his significant personal investment in Huntington. Since joining Huntington in January 2009, Mr. Steinour has purchased over 1.5 million shares of Huntington common stock in open market
	transactions. As of December 31, 2016, Mr. Steinour directly and indirectly owned shares of Huntington common stock equal to approximately 41X his salary, significantly exceeding our best practice 6X salary ownership guideline. Each
	executive officer generally has 5 years to comply with his or her requirements. In addition, executive officers are subject to a holding requirement equal to 50% of net shares received upon the exercises of a stock option or upon the release of full
	value awards. This amount of shares must be held until retirement or other departure from the company. See additional detail under Stock Ownership & Holding Requirements later in this discussion.



	Consideration of


	Say-on-Pay


	/ Shareholder Outreach

	.
	More than 95% of the votes cast for our


	say-on-pay


	advisory vote at the 2016 annual meeting were in favor of our executive compensation programs. We strive
	to continually strengthen our compensation practices based on our philosophy, market best practices and feedback received from shareholders. During 2016, we continued our shareholder outreach and held conversations with investors holding
	approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock. The Board and management have gained valuable insight from these interactions and will continue to seek shareholder input. Based on the


	say-on-pay


	vote and other feedback, the Compensation Committee has determined to maintain the essential design of our compensation program. We will continue to monitor emerging trends and best
	practices and seek ways to improve our compensation programs and ensure continued alignment between our pay and performance.

	Discussion & Analysis is divided into four sections:

	Our Business Strategy, Goals and Accomplishments




	In 2009, Huntington developed a strategic plan for its core businesses, the primary objective of which was to increase market share and share of wallet
	in the markets we serve, while recognizing the need to create a balanced executional focus on four key constituencies: Customers, Colleagues, Communities and Shareholders. Execution of the strategy has positioned Huntington as an industry leader in
	growth of households and share of wallet, with further opportunities to grow market share and share of wallet.


	While the financial services
	industry is currently being significantly impacted by the substantial effect that regulation and economic conditions have on profitability and competitive position, Huntingtons 2016 performance was strong. In 2016 we demonstrated continued
	progress toward achieving our long-term financial goals. We delivered positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. Total revenue increased 18% over the prior year, materially aided by the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation in
	August 2016. Net charge-offs remained below our long-term goal for the third consecutive year. We also executed our balance sheet optimization strategy, in which we chose to shrink the balance sheet in order to replenish our capital ratios more
	quickly.


	2016 was a historic, and in many ways transformational, year for Huntington. We celebrated the 150th anniversary of The Huntington
	National Bank, proudly serving our local communities for generations. We completed the largest acquisition in our companys history, FirstMerit Corporation. We also eclipsed two meaningful financial milestones for the first time as total assets
	exceeded $100 billion, and quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion. And, we added extraordinary talent and new growth opportunities with new products.

	Consistent with Huntingtons pay for performance philosophy, the Compensation
	Committees 2016 compensation program for executive officers emphasized performance-based compensation. Huntingtons 2016 performance against the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) metrics was 180% of target. The named executive officers
	participating in MIP earned annual incentive awards ranging from 181% to 196% of target. Executive officers also received long-term incentive awards in 2016 comprised of performance stock units (PSUs), restricted stock units
	(RSUs) and stock options, and merit-based salary increases.

	Determination of Compensation







	Philosophy and Decision-Making Process






	The Compensation Committee develops and approves our executive compensation with input from our management and the independent compensation consultant. Our management provides information and may make
	recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the amount and form of executive compensation. In addition, our CEO and CFO make recommendations to the Compensation Committee when it sets specific financial measures and goals for
	determining incentive compensation. Our CEO provides input and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance and compensation of his direct reports, which include the NEOs. The CEO does not

	Table of Contents




	make recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding his own compensation, other than requests in prior years that the Compensation Committee defer consideration of a base salary increase
	for him. From time to time, the Compensation Committee consults with other committees of the board and may obtain the approval of the full board of directors with respect to certain executive and director compensation matters. For additional detail,
	see Procedures for Determining Executive and Director Compensation; Compensation Consultant in the Corporate Governance section above.




	We provide a balanced total compensation package, which includes both fixed and variable, performance-based elements. The use of both short-term and long-term incentives ensures that the ultimate compensation
	delivered is dependent upon achievement of our annual business goals, as well as delivering long-term shareholder value. Our performance and evaluation process considers company, business segment and individual performance, as well as performance
	relative to industry peers. Our target pay levels are designed to be competitive with market practice. Since a majority of our pay is variable and based on performance, our actual pay positioning will vary appropriately to reflect our performance.




	While overall compensation policies generally apply to all executives, we recognize the need to differentiate compensation by
	individual, reflecting on his or her role, experience, performance, and expected contributions. Base salaries and incentive targets are the primary means for differentiating compensation opportunities to reflect executive role and scope of
	responsibility. For example, Mr. Steinour has a higher base salary and higher potential award opportunities due to his responsibilities as CEO. He is also held to a higher stock ownership guideline, reflecting his increased stake in our
	performance.

	Market Referencing






	The Compensation Committee regularly reviews peer and industry information in regard to levels of compensation and performance as a competitive frame of reference. The Compensation Committee uses this information
	and analysis as a benchmarking reference for setting pay opportunities and making pay decisions, such as changes to base salaries, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive grants. A key source of information is a peer group of regional banks
	similar to Huntington in terms of size and business model. The peer banks are chosen using an objective process recommended by the independent compensation consultant and approved by the Compensation Committee. For fiscal year 2016 and in
	anticipation of the FirstMerit acquisition, the Compensation Committee approved two groups of peer banks. The first peer group has a frame of reference for understanding compensation levels and program design before the acquisition of FirstMerit and
	the second peer group was used for the same purposes following the acquisition of FirstMerit.




	We

	re-evaluated

	and updated the peer group in 2016 for ongoing relevance, as we do each year. The process began with the selection of U.S. based publicly traded commercial banks considering asset size as of
	December 31, 2015. A

	or focus, a focus on different services, a high level of inside ownership, and

	off-shore

	headquarters. Two banks that were present in the 2015 peer group have been removed due to acquisitions: FirstMerit
	Corporation was acquired by Huntington in August of 2016 and First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. was acquired by KeyCorp in July of 2016. The resulting group consisted of fourteen bank holding companies; eight larger and six smaller, positioning
	Huntington at approximately the 50th percentile for

	pre-acquisition

	asset size. The Compensation Committee used the fourteen peers to represent the most appropriate market comparators for Huntington in terms
	of industry and size in the

	pre-acquisition

	landscape. The table below lists the peer banks approved by the Compensation Committee for 2016 prior to the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation.

	Upon Huntingtons acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation in August of 2016, the independent compensation
	consultant recommended that Huntington adjust its peer frame of reference to represent our post-acquisition asset size. The selection process was similar to the one developed for the

	pre-acquisition

	peer
	group, beginning with the selection of U.S. based publically traded commercial banks considering asset size as of August 16, 2016. A number of banks with relevant post-acquisition asset size were eliminated due to a business model which
	included one or more of: international process of focus, a focus on different services, a high level of inside ownership, and

	off-shore

	headquarters. Five banks that were present in the 2016

	pre-acquisition

	peer group have been removed: Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., Synovus Financial Corporation, Associated Banc-Corporation, First Horizon National Corporation, and Commerce Bancshares, Inc. have been
	removed due to having assets below $50 billion. One bank holding company was added to the post-acquisition peer group: CIT Group Inc. The resulting group consisted of ten bank holding companies; five larger and five smaller, positioning
	Huntington at approximately the 50th percentile for post-acquisition asset size. The Compensation Committee used the ten peers to represent the most appropriate market comparators for Huntington in terms of industry and size in the post-acquisition
	landscape. The table below lists the peer banks approved by the Compensation Committee for 2016, effective upon the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation.

	The independent compensation consultant also provided the Compensation Committee with industry surveys as
	appropriate to supplement the peer group data. When using survey data, the information was reflective of Huntingtons size and industry. This included utilizing size adjusted comparisons representing data from companies that fell closest to our
	asset size. The Compensation Committee also relied on the independent compensation consultant to provide a broader industry perspective of emerging trends and best practices.




	Among the peer and industry data considered in 2016 were three-year total shareholder return relative to peers, three-year relative performance in incentive measures, and realizable pay over the prior three years
	relative to peers. With the assistance of the independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee performed a pay and performance analysis in 2016 for the 2013  2015 period and determined that there was appropriate
	alignment between performance and pay. The Compensation Committee performs a pay and performance analysis on an annual basis to review the appropriateness of the companys executive compensation program.

	2016 Compensation Decisions










	Timing of Compensation Decisions






	In February of each year, the Compensation Committee
	approves annual incentive awards which are tied directly to prior year performance. These awards are based on metrics chosen by the Compensation Committee the preceding February. During the second quarter of the year, the Compensation Committee
	makes decisions with respect to base salary adjustments and equity-based long-term incentive based on performance and on other factors discussed below. With respect to the incentive compensation amounts reported for 2016 in the Summary Compensation
	Table:

	Plan column.

	


	 


	Long-term incentives granted on May 1, 2016 are based on a multi-faceted approach that includes company and individual performance and contributions, retention value of current equity ownership, historical
	long-term incentive compensation awards and the market-based framework the independent consultant developed. These awards are reported under the columns Stock Awards and Option Awards.




	The following discussion of compensation decisions with respect to base salary adjustments, annual incentive awards under MIP and annual equity grants
	below is applicable to each of the NEOs other than Sandra E. Pierce. Ms. Pierce joined Huntington in August 2016 upon Huntingtons acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation, as Private Client Group Director, Regional Banking Director and
	Senior Executive Vice President of the Huntington National Bank. Much of Ms. Pierces compensation was paid pursuant to the retention letter negotiated with her in connection with the transaction and Huntingtons decision to retain her,
	and is discussed under Compensation Decisions below. A portion of Ms. Pierces compensation was determined by FirstMerit Corporation prior to the acquisition by Huntington.




	Base Salary




	Each of the NEOs then
	serving received a merit-based salary increase effective May 1, 2016. The increase for the CEO was equal to 10% of base salary, and the increases for the other NEOs ranged from 3.8% to 6.1%. The increase for the CEO was the first since his hire
	in 2009; for several years after joining the company, the CEO expressed a desire to not be considered for a base salary increase, which was honored by the Compensation Committee. All salary increases were market competitive.




	Annual Incentive Award




	Huntingtons annual incentive awards under the Management Incentive Plan reflect company performance on key short-term measures, adjusted in the
	discretion of the CEO and the Compensation Committee, for business segment and individual performance. The Compensation Committee considers the appropriate corporate performance metrics for each year.


	The metrics for 2016 were determined by the Compensation Committee to be earnings per share, return on tangible common equity, and operating leverage,
	which were the same metrics selected for 2015. These performance metrics were chosen from among the list of available criteria under MIP and represented key short-term strategic areas of focus intended to support long-term success. The choice of
	metrics also reflected a balanced approach to measuring success. The metric of operating leverage ensures that our incentives are aligned with our commitment to shareholders to grow revenue faster than expenses. Return on tangible common equity
	(ROTCE) was chosen due to the strong correlation of higher ROTCE to higher market


	price-to-tangible


	book value (P/TBV) valuations for the common stocks of
	publicly-traded bank holding companies.


	Each executive has an annual target incentive opportunity expressed as a percentage of his or her base
	salary. The specific threshold, target and maximum opportunity for each executive is reflective of the executives role and competitive market practice. For 2016, the CEOs target incentive was equal to 125% of his base salary. For the
	other participating NEOs, the 2016 MIP target was equal to 80% of base salary.



	Company Performance

	. For each metric the Compensation
	Committee determined a threshold, target, and maximum level of achievement based on the companys operating plan for 2016. MIP allows for awards to be earned under each plan criterion, independent of the other criteria. We interpolate between
	the threshold, target, and maximum goals to ensure sound incentive compensation arrangements and appropriate pay for performance alignment. In determining whether a performance goal has been met, the Committee will include or exclude
	extraordinary events or any other objective events or occurrences, in either establishing the performance goal based on the qualifying performance criteria or in determining whether the performance goal has been achieved; provided,
	however, that the Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate an award that would otherwise be paid to any participant based on the Committees evaluation of such events or other factors. Awards may be paid only after the
	Compensation Committee has certified in writing that the performance goals have been met.


	In addition, the 2016 cycle of MIP included an individual
	funding mechanism for each of the participating NEOs, excluding the CFO, equal to a maximum of 0.5% of net income for the CEO and a maximum of 0.2% of net income for the other participating NEOs. No awards would have been paid to these select NEOs
	if positive net income had not been achieved for 2016.


	The companys 2016 performance was reviewed in accordance with the MIP and certified by
	the Compensation Committee in February 2017. Excluding significant items, actual performance against the EPS goal was above target, and actual performance against the ROTCE and Operating Leverage goals exceeded the maximum.

	Adjustments for Individual Performance

	. The final award for the CEO may be adjusted for his individual performance
	at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Due to limits for deducting compensation expenses under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the award for the CEO could have been adjusted downward or upward within the overall parameters of MIP,
	but not increased above the individual funding factor of 0.5% of net income (approximately $3,426,000). Final awards for the other NEOs may be adjusted, at the discretion of the CEO and the Compensation Committee, for business segment and individual
	performance. Due to limits for deducting compensation expenses under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), awards for Mr. Heller, and Ms. Houston could have been adjusted downward or upward within the overall parameters of MIP, but
	not increased above the individual funding factor of 0.2% of net income (approximately $1,370,000). As the position of CFO is not a covered officer under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the award for Mr. McCullough
	was not subject to a cap other than the $7,500,000 limit for any award granted under the terms of the plan. The portion of each award that exceeded target was converted and paid in RSUs based on the closing price of a share of common stock on the
	grant date. Final awards for the NEOs are discussed below under Compensation of the Named Executive Officers.




	Long-Term Incentive

	Determining LTI Grant Value

	. The Compensation Committee engaged the independent compensation consultant to develop
	long-term incentive award ranges based on competitive market practice to serve as guidelines for annual grants. In addition to these guidelines, when determining award ranges for individual executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers
	the impact on potential total compensation. Award opportunities are within a range defined by a low to high percentage of base salary to allow for awards to vary in order to reflect individual performance. These ranges are exclusive of RSUs paid as
	a portion of MIP.

	Design of PSUs.

	With assistance from the independent consultant, the Compensation Committee selected
	the same two metrics for the PSUs granted in 2016 as used in 2015: return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) and TSR. For the 2016 grant, the goals for both metrics are relative to the performance of peers in order to alleviate goal setting
	challenges due to the then-pending acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation. The company believes ROTCE and TSR are key factors to long-term value creation. There is a strong correlation of higher ROTCEs to higher market


	price-to-tangible


	book value (P/TBV) valuations for the common stock of publicly-traded bank holding companies. TSR aligns long-term incentive compensation to value
	created for our shareholders.


	As reflected in the table below, the Compensation Committee determined a threshold, target and maximum level of
	achievement for the three-year performance cycle. In calculating performance to determine whether a performance goal has been achieved, the Compensation Committee will adjust for Extraordinary Events as defined in the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

	TSR will be measured over the length of the cycle, from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. ROTCE results are
	measured annually, adjusted for extraordinary items, and averaged using

	year-end

	reported amounts. The range of potential payouts, 0% to 150% of the target number of share units, was consistent with the design
	of PSUs awarded in the prior year, and determined to be within competitive market practice, and reasonable from an annual share run rate and dilution perspective.



	Determination of individual LTI Grants.

	The Compensation Committee independently evaluated the CEOs performance for the purpose of
	determining a 2016 long-term incentive award and assessed the competitive pay positioning that would result from the awards to be consistent with our


	pay-for-performance


	philosophy.


	In determining award values for the other NEOs, the Compensation Committee considered the CEOs performance assessments for each
	NEO, as well as additional input from the CEO, and the market guidelines provided by the consultant. Consistent with the companys philosophy, the chief executive officers evaluation was based on a holistic approach that included
	individual performance and contributions, retention value of current equity ownership, historical long-term incentive compensation awards and the market-based framework the independent consultant developed. The key factors included in the evaluation
	of each NEO are discussed under Compensation Decisions for each Named Executive Officer below. The Compensation Committee approved awards in 2016 for the NEOs, excluding the chief executive officer, as recommended by the CEO. Ms. Pierce
	received an equity retention award granted to her by Huntington pursuant to the retention letter between Ms. Pierce and Huntington.






	Compensation Decisions for each Named Executive Officer




	When considering base salary increases, adjusting MIP awards for business segment and individual performance, and determining the grant-date value of
	long-term incentive compensation awards, the CEO and Compensation Committee considered the performance of each executive under the following common factors:


	 


















	 



	Common


	Performance


	Factors:



	 



	    financial and operating results





	 


	 



	    strategic planning and implementation





	 


	 



	    risk management and key metrics





	 


	 



	    organization/colleagues





	 


	 



	    continuous improvement





	 


	 



	    community/stakeholder relations.






	Further, the Compensation Committee differentiated compensation for the NEOs other than the CEO by taking into
	consideration the CEOs evaluation of each executives performance, role and relative contribution to overall company performance. Although there were no predetermined quantifiable goals against which business unit and individual
	performance were evaluated independently for purposes of determining compensation, highlights of the specific 2016 individual and business unit performance considered by the Compensation Committee for each NEO are set forth below.

	Sandra E. Pierce, Private Client Group Director.

	 Ms. Pierce joined Huntington as Private Client Group
	Director, Regional Banking Director and Senior Executive Vice President of The Huntington National Bank, effective upon the completion of the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation in August 2016. Ms. Pierce previously served as Vice Chairman of
	FirstMerit Corporation and as Chairman and CEO of FirstMerit Michigan. In connection with Ms. Pierces joining Huntington upon the completion of the merger, the Compensation Committee entered into a retention letter with Ms. Pierce which
	provides for a base salary equal to $594,104 subject to adjustment in accordance with the policies as in effect from time to time. In addition, the retention letter approved by the Compensation Committee provides for several payments to compensate
	Ms. Pierce for certain payments and benefits to which she would have been entitled under her


	change-in-control


	agreement with FirstMerit upon a qualifying
	termination of employment during the 30 month period following the


	change-in-control.


	These payments consisted of (i) a cash retention bonus credited or to be credited
	to Ms. Pierces account under Huntingtons Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which is fully vested and will be paid to Ms. Pierce upon any termination of her employment that constitutes a Separation of Service under Section
	409A of the tax code and (ii) an equity retention grant, in the form of an RSU award, credited or to be credited to Ms. Pierces account under Huntingtons Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, and (iii) a cash credit to
	Ms. Pierces account under the 2008 FirstMerit Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.


	Prior to the completion of
	Huntingtons acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation, Ms. Pierce participated in FirstMerits 2013 Annual Incentive Plan pursuant to which she was eligible to receive a cash bonus based on FirstMerits performance and her individual
	performance during 2016. In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement between Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation, immediately prior to the completion of Huntingtons acquisition of FirstMerit, FirstMerit determined Ms. Pierces
	annual bonus for 2016 based on performance through the date of the closing, and annualized for the full year, in an amount equal to $805,949. In February 2017, the Compensation Committee awarded Ms. Pierce an additional bonus of $44,051 in respect
	of her performance with Huntington following the merger.

	Recently Completed PSU Performance Cycles





	2014




	 




	 2016 Cycle

	. December 31, 2016 marked the end of the three-year performance cycle for PSU
	awards granted in 2014. The Compensation Committee expects to certify the results and determine the final values for these PSU awards in April 2017. The metrics for this cycle were relative return on assets targeted at the 50

	th

	percentile performance for the


	 


	32







	Table of Contents



	selected peer group, efficiency ratio targeted at 61% for the three years, and absolute revenue growth targeted at 3.0% annualized over the three years, all adjusted for significant items. During
	the period January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016, absolute efficiency ratio was between threshold and target performance and absolute revenue growth was above maximum performance. Our performance against the relative return on assets
	metric has not yet been determined.



	2013




	 




	 2015 Cycle

	. In April 2016, the Compensation Committee
	determined the final award values for the PSU awards granted in 2013, which had a three-year performance cycle that ended on December 31, 2015. These awards were paid in shares of stock reported on a Form 4 report filed for each participating
	executive officer. The metrics for this cycle were relative return on assets targeted at the 50th percentile performance for the selected peer group, efficiency ratio targeted at 61.5% for the three years, and absolute revenue growth targeted at
	3.0% annualized over the three years, all unadjusted for significant items. During the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, relative return on assets exceeded target performance, absolute revenue growth was less than target,
	and the efficiency ratio was higher (worse) than target. Final awards were equal to 85% of target.




	Other Policies & Practices






	Benefits




	Executive officers
	participate in the same broad-based benefit programs generally available to all employees. A limited number of additional benefits are offered to executive officers and certain other officers and are designed to represent a modest portion of total
	compensation. Following is a list of the additional benefits and compensation elements offered to executive officers during 2016.


	Supplemental
	Savings: The NEOs are eligible to participate in a supplemental defined contribution plan. This plan is further discussed following the

	Non-Qualified

	Deferred Compensation 2016 table below.


	Deferred Compensation: Our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, a

	non-qualified

	plan, provides a vehicle for
	participants to defer receipt of cash or stock to a time when taxes may be at a more personally beneficial rate and / or to save for long-term financial needs. This plan is discussed in more detail following the

	Non-Qualified

	Deferred Compensation 2016 table below.


	Perquisites: A very limited number of perquisites are
	utilized at Huntington; they represent a small component of compensation and are not intended to be performance-based. We offer an incurred expense reimbursement allowance for tax and financial planning to our NEOs, up to 2% of base salary per year.
	For the chief executive officer, we provide security monitoring of his personal residence, and for efficiency and security, use of our cars and drivers and occasional use of a corporate aircraft to which the company has access. All personal use of
	the corporate aircraft is in accordance with Huntingtons Aircraft Usage Policy. We also provide relocation benefits to senior level employees to facilitate transition to their new locations.


	Employment Agreement: Only one executive officer, the CEO, has an employment agreement with us, which was renewed effective December 31, 2016. The
	employment agreement is described under Mr. Steinours Employment Agreement below.


	Severance Arrangements: Huntington has


	change-in-control


	agreements, referred to as Executive Agreements, with our NEOs. The objectives of the Executive Agreements are to provide severance protections for the NEOs
	in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with a


	change-in-control


	of Huntington and to encourage their continued employment in the event of
	any actual or threatened


	change-in-control


	of Huntington. The Executive Agreements are further described under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in
	Control below.


	Frozen Supplemental Pension: NEOs who are participants in the frozen pension plan (frozen on December 31, 2013) are
	participants in a supplemental defined benefit plan that was also frozen on the same date. This plan is further discussed under the Pension Benefits 2016 table, below.




	Stock Ownership & Holding Requirements




	The Compensation Committee first established stock ownership requirements, expressed as a number of shares, for executive officers in 2006. Effective
	January 1, 2016, the Compensation Committee adopted a value-based approach pursuant to which executives are required to meet and maintain a dollar value of ownership based on a multiple of current salary rather than a prescribed number of
	shares. This will provide a consistent measure for all executives without regard to the date an executive becomes subject to the requirements and reduces the impact of stock price fluctuations. Ownership levels are evaluated annually based on then
	current stock prices. The executives current base salary will be multiplied by his or her assigned multiple and compared to current holdings, valued based on a

	30-day

	average closing stock price. After
	becoming subject to the guidelines, executives generally have five years to meet their ownership levels. Thereafter,


	 


	33







	Table of Contents



	executives must continue to meet their requirements on an

	on-going

	basis. Executive officers continue to be subject to a holding requirement equal to 50%
	of net shares received upon the exercises of a stock option or upon the release of full value awards. This amount of shares must be held until retirement or other departure from the company. The Compensation Committee may permit a discretionary
	hardship exemption from the ownership and / or holding requirements, on a


	case-by-case


	basis.


	The ownership requirement and level of compliance as of December 31, 2016, for each NEO are set forth in the table below.

	(1)


	Executive officers generally have five years to meet their ownership levels. During 2016, the Compensation Committee increased Ms. Houstons multiple from 2X to 3X and granted her an additional two years to
	attain the greater ownership level.




	 




	(2)


	Value is based on the closing price of a share of Huntington common stock on December 30, 2016 ($13.22).






	Hedging & Pledging Policies




	The Compensation Committee has a policy prohibiting Huntingtons executive officers from hedging their ownership of Huntington stock, as this would
	be inconsistent with the goals of the compensation program. Prohibited hedging activity includes trading in financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Huntington stock. These financial instruments include
	prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds.


	In addition, executive officers and directors are generally
	discouraged from pledging their Huntington securities, however they may pledge shares owned in excess of stock ownership guidelines with the consent of the General Counsel. Any such request, along with the General Counsels response, must be
	communicated to the Compensation Committee. None of Huntingtons executive officers or directors currently has shares of Huntington stock pledged.




	Annual Long-Term Incentive Award Grant Practices




	The Compensation Committee may designate a grant date effective following the date of the committee action. This practice is followed in the event the
	trading window is closed pursuant to the companys trading policies on the date the committee acts. Since 2012 we have granted our annual long-term incentive awards effective May 1. The exercise price for each stock option award is equal to the
	fair market value of a share of common stock on the grant date. Under the companys stock plan, fair market value is generally defined as the closing price on the applicable date. We have never repriced stock options.




	Recoupment / Clawback Policies




	Our
	Recoupment / Clawback Policy is a tool for recoupment or clawback of incentive compensation in appropriate situations to the extent permitted (or required) by law and by the companys plans, policies and agreements. Incentive Compensation
	subject to possible clawback or recoupment includes:


	 




	(a)


	any bonus or other cash incentive payment, including commissions, previously paid or payable, and




	 




	(b)


	any equity compensation, vested or unvested (including without limitation, performance shares and performance share units, restricted stock and restricted stock units, and stock options), and net proceeds of any
	exercised or vested equity awards.




	In general, situations that trigger a review under this policy involve behaviors or actions outside
	the bounds of the companys overall risk appetite and governance structure. In determining whether to require reimbursement or forfeiture of an executive officers incentive compensation, the Compensation Committee shall take into account
	such considerations as it deems appropriate, such as the extent to which the employees actions or inactions were in violation of the code of


	 


	34







	Table of Contents



	conduct; whether the action or inaction could reasonably be expected to cause financial or reputational harm to the company; the egregiousness of the conduct; the tax consequences to the affected
	employee; and other factors as the Committee deems appropriate under the circumstances. For employees who are not executive officers, the decision to recoup or clawback incentive compensation is made by the CEO jointly with the Chief Human Resources
	Officer.


	Specific provisions apply in the event of a financial restatement. If it is determined by the board of directors that gross negligence,
	intentional misconduct or fraud by an employee or former employee caused or partially caused the company to have to restate all or a portion of its financial statements, the board, in its sole discretion, may, to the extent permitted by law and the
	companys benefit plans, policies and agreements, and to the extent it determined in its sole judgment that it is in the best interests of the company to do so, require repayment of a portion or all of any Incentive Compensation if (1) the
	amount or vesting of the Incentive Compensation was calculated based upon, or contingent on, the achievement of financial or operating results that were the subject of or affected by the restatement; and (2) the amount or vesting of the
	Incentive Compensation would have been less had the financial statements been correct.


	Further, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act,
	if the company is required to restate any of its financial statements because of a material financial reporting violation, the company shall recover the amount in excess of the incentive compensation payable under the companys restated
	financial statements, or such other amount required under the Dodd-Frank Act or any other applicable law or policy. The company shall recover this amount from any current or former employee who received incentive compensation during the three-year
	period preceding the date on which the restatement is required, or from any other individual specified in the Dodd-Frank Act.


	In addition, we have
	included clawback provisions in incentive plans for executive officers and for all employees. For NEOs our recoupment and clawback policies include the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Stock Plans. We also have forfeiture and recoupment provisions in the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan specific to awards under these plans. Except following a change in control event, should the Compensation Committee
	determine that a participant has committed a serious breach of conduct or has solicited or taken away customers or potential customers with whom the participant had contact during the participants employment with us, the Compensation Committee
	may terminate any outstanding award, in whole or in part, whether or not yet vested. If such conduct or activity occurs within three years following the exercise or payment of an award, the Compensation Committee may require the participant or
	former participant to repay to us any gain realized or payment received upon exercise or payment of such award. A serious breach of conduct includes, without limitation, any conduct prejudicial to or in conflict with Huntington or any securities law
	violations including any violations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, awards may be forfeited upon termination of employment for cause.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Annual Incentive Plan. The Management Incentive Plan provides that if Huntington is required to restate any of its financial statements because of a material financial reporting violation, Huntington will recover the
	amount in excess of the award payable under Huntingtons restated financial statements, or such other amount required under the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, if the Compensation Committee determines that a participant took unnecessary or
	excessive risk, manipulated earnings, or engaged in any misconduct described in our Recoupment Policy, the Committee may terminate the participants participation in the plan and require repayment of any amount previously paid in accordance
	with the Recoupment Policy, any other applicable policies and any other applicable laws and regulations.




	Section 954 of
	Dodd-Frank requires new listing standards related to recovery of executive compensation. The board of directors will review its recoupment policies in light of these new standards when they are adopted by NASDAQ, and as other rules and best
	practices develop.




	Tax & Accounting Considerations




	We have worked to balance our compensation philosophy with the goal of achieving maximum deductibility under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). Our
	Management Incentive Plan and our 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan have been structured so that awards under these plans for covered officers may qualify as performance-based compensation deductible for federal income tax purposes under
	Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee has also reserved the right, however, with respect to any award or awards, to determine that compliance with Code Section 162(m) is not desired after consideration of the goals of
	Huntingtons executive compensation philosophy and whether it is in the best interests of Huntington to have such award so qualified. Huntington also takes into consideration Internal Revenue Code Section 409A with respect to

	non-qualified

	deferred compensation programs, and ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation in administering its equity compensation program.

	Mr. Steinour also serves as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Huntington National Bank. Ms. Pierce joined Huntington as Private Client Group Director and Senior Executive Vice President of
	The Huntington National Bank, effective upon the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation in August 2016. She also serves as Regional Banking Director. Mr. Heller is also responsible for Home Lending and the Phone Bank.




	 




	(2)


	In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement between Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation, Ms. Pierce received an annual cash incentive award in the amount $805,949 based on FirstMerits performance
	against the goals established by FirstMerit for 2016, measured as of the acquisition date and annualized for the full year. In addition, in February 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a supplemental cash incentive payment of $44,051 in
	recognition of her performance with Huntington following the merger.




	 




	(3)


	The amounts in this column are the grant date fair values of awards of restricted stock units and performance share units determined for accounting purposes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The performance share
	units are valued at target. The assumptions made in the valuation are discussed in Note 15 Share-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.
	These awards were granted on May 1, 2016, with the exception of the retention award which was granted on August 16, 2016 pursuant to the retention letter entered into between Huntington and Ms. Pierce.

	The amounts in this column are the dollar value of annual incentive awards earned under the Management Incentive Plan for 2016. These awards were paid in cash up to the target award amount; any amount earned in excess
	of target was paid in RSUs which vest in three equal annual increments from the date of grant. The number of RSUs was determined by dividing the portion of the award in excess of target by $14.12, the closing price of a share of Huntington common
	stock on the grant date, February 14, 2017, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

	The amounts in this column represent the change in the actuarial present value of accumulated benefit from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, under two defined benefit pension plans: the Retirement Plan
	and the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan, referred to as the SRIP. These plans were closed to new hires after December 31, 2009 and were frozen as of December 31, 2013. Benefits are based on levels of compensation and years of credited
	service as of December 31, 2013. The valuation method used to determine the present values, and all material assumptions applied, are discussed in Note 16 Benefit Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The change in present value for each NEO under each plan is detailed below. Mr. McCullough, Ms. Pierce, Mr. Heller and Ms. Houston are not eligible to participate in these plans as they
	were hired after participation was closed to new hires. Additional detail about these plans is set forth in the discussion following the table of Pension Benefits 2016 below. There were no above-market or preferential earnings on

	non-qualified

	deferred compensation.

	The amounts contributed to the 401(k) Plan include a profit sharing contribution earned for 2016 equal to 1% of base
	salary subject to IRS limits on compensation that may be taken into account. In the ordinary course of business, Huntington maintains two automobiles and has access to a corporate aircraft as needed to provide efficient and secure business
	transportation for senior management. When it is not otherwise needed for business travel, a corporate aircraft may be available to Mr. Steinour for personal usage given the constraints of commercial flight arrangements, en route work
	requirements, travel or work schedules or other circumstances burdensome on time and the potential security risks for the company. The incremental cost to Huntington for personal use of a plane by Mr. Steinour during 2016 was based on an hourly
	rate and totaled $243,334, consisting of charges for crew, landing and parking, fuel and oil, radio maintenance and repairs, supplies, and outside services. For efficiency and security Mr. Steinour is also permitted personal use of the
	automobiles, driven by Huntington security personnel, including for commuting, which permits him to work while traveling. The incremental cost of this usage to Huntington for 2016 was based on a rate per mile for fuel and maintenance and overtime
	costs for the drivers. Other perquisites and personal benefits for Mr. Steinour consisted of financial planning ($21,635) and security monitoring of his personal residence. Mr. Hellers perquisites consisted of financial planning
	($12,000) and partial reimbursement for use of a personal mobile device (which benefit has been discontinued). Perquisites and personal benefits for each of the other named executive officers were zero or did not exceed $10,000 and are not included.

	Each of the named executive officers, with the exception of Ms. Pierce, participated in the 2016 cycle of the Management Incentive Plan, our annual incentive plan. The award opportunities presented in the table are
	based on percentages of salary and threshold, target and maximum levels of corporate performance. Awards are subject to adjustment for individual and business unit performance. Actual awards earned for 2016 are reported in the Summary Compensation
	Table under the column headed

	Non-Equity

	Incentive Compensation.




	 




	(2)


	Each of the named executive officers, with the exception of Ms. Pierce, is a participant in the PSU award cycle commencing in 2016. These columns reflect the potential number of PSUs to be vested upon satisfaction of
	the applicable performance conditions as of December 31, 2018, at threshold, target and maximum performance.




	 




	(3)


	The Compensation Committee awarded RSUs to each of the named executive officers. The RSU award for Ms. Pierce vests in three equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of
	grant. The RSU award for each of the other named executive officers vests in two equal installments on the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date.




	 




	(4)


	The Compensation Committee awarded stock options to each of the named executive officers, other than Ms. Pierce. These stock options vest in four equal annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant.




	 




	(5)


	Each stock option reported has a per share exercise price equal to the closing price of a share of Huntington common stock on the grant date, as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market.




	 




	(6)


	The amounts in this column are the grant date fair values, for accounting purposes, of the awards of PSUs (at target), RSUs and stock options determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.

	Awards of stock options granted in 2013 through 2016 become exercisable in four equal annual increments from the date of grant and are fully vested on the fourth anniversary. The earlier awards of stock options reported
	in the table have all become exercisable and are fully vested.




	 




	(2)


	The awards of restricted stock units granted on May 1st each year vest in two equal installments on the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. The awards of restricted stock units granted to
	Mr. McCullough on April 9, 2014, and to Ms. Pierce on August 16, 2016, vest in 3 equal increments over 3 years. An award of restricted stock granted to Ms. Pierce by FirstMerit Corporation on April 1, 2016, was
	converted to a restricted stock award with respect to Huntington common stock upon the merger effective August 16, 2016, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the award as granted by FirstMerit Corporation. One third of these
	restricted shares will vest on April 21 of each of the following three years. Each other award of restricted stock units reflected in this column was granted in partial payment of annual incentive earned under the Management Incentive Plan and
	vests in 3 equal increments over 3 years. The awards granted on and after May 1, 2015, reflect the impact of dividend reinvestment.




	 




	(3)


	The market value of the awards of restricted stock units that have not yet vested was determined by multiplying the closing price of a share of Huntington common stock on December 30, 2016 ($13.22) by the number of
	shares.




	 




	(4)


	The performance share units reported in these columns will vest subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals as of the end of a three-year performance period. Each performance share unit is equal to one
	share of common stock. The number of performance share units and the market value reported were determined on the basis of achieving target performance goals. The market value of the performance share units was determined by multiplying the closing
	price of a share of Huntington common stock on December 30, 2016 ($13.22) by the number of units. The performance share units granted on May 1, 2014 vested on December 31, 2016; awards will be released in April 2017 after final award
	values are determined and certified by the Compensation Committee. Awards granted on and after May 1, 2015, reflect the impact of dividend reinvestment.




	The table below sets forth the number of shares that were acquired upon the exercise of options and the vesting of RSUs in 2016. Also included are shares
	acquired from the vesting of PSU awards for the cycle that ended December 31, 2015. These shares were released on April 20, 2016. Not reflected are shares to be received for the three-year PSU performance cycle that ended on
	December 31, 2016. The metrics for this cycle were relative return on assets, absolute efficiency ratio and absolute revenue growth, as reported, unadjusted for significant items. The Compensation Committee expects to certify the results and
	determine the final award values in April 2017.

	The value realized upon exercise of options reflects the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the options. The value realized upon vesting of RSUs was
	determined by multiplying the number of shares by the market value on the vesting date. Mr. Steinour and Mr. Houston deferred 184,135 shares and 9,932 shares, respectively, acquired upon vesting pursuant to the terms of the Executive
	Deferred Compensation Plan described below.

	The employer contributions are also reported in the Summary Compensation Table under All Other Compensation. The amount reported as contributed to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for Ms. Pierce
	represents the net amount of the cash retention bonus of $1,750,068, after reduction for taxes.




	 




	(2)


	The

	year-end

	balances in this column reflect our employer matching contributions under the Supplemental Plan made and reported as compensation for the named executive officers for
	2014 and 2015 in the Summary Compensation Table under All Other Compensation as follows: $65,625 for Mr. Steinour, $11,402 for Mr. McCullough, and $9,711 for Ms. Houston.




	 




	(3)


	Ms. Pierce has an account under the 2008 FirstMerit Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. A participant in this plan will receive a distribution in cash equal to the value of the vested portion of his
	or her account generally within 90 days following his or her separation from service. Each participant may direct that the participants account be valued as if it is invested in one or more available investment fund indices.






	The Supplemental Plan




	The purpose of
	the Supplemental Plan is to provide a supplemental savings program for eligible employees (as determined by the Compensation Committee) who are unable to continue to make contributions to the Huntington Investment and Tax Savings Plan, a tax
	qualified 401(k) plan referred to as the 401(k) Plan, for part of the year because the individual has: (I) contributed the maximum amount permitted by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year ($18,000 in 2016); or (II) received
	the maximum amount of compensation permitted to be taken into account by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year ($265,000 in 2016). The 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental Plan work together. When an employee elects to participate in the
	401(k) Plan, he or she designates the percentage between 1% and 75% of base pay on a

	pre-tax,

	Roth after tax, or a combination of

	pre-tax

	and Roth

	after-tax

	basis that is to be contributed to the 401(k) Plan. Contributions to the 401(k) Plan are automatically deducted from the employees pay and then allocated to the employees 401(k) Plan account.
	For 2016, we matched 100% on the first 4% of base compensation deferred. The Supplemental Plan generally works the same way. When a participant elects to participate in the Supplemental Plan, he or she designates the percentage of base pay that is
	to be contributed to the Supplemental Plan  between 1% and 75% of


	 


	42







	Table of Contents




	base pay. All contributions to the Supplemental Plan must be on a

	pre-tax

	basis. We then match contributions according to the same formula used by the
	401(k) Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, employees can invest their contributions and our matching contributions in any of 30 investment alternatives. Under the Supplemental Plan, employee

	pre-tax

	contributions and
	our matching contributions are generally invested in Huntington common stock.




	A participant cannot receive a distribution of any part of
	his account in the Supplemental Plan until his or her employment terminates. Once employment terminates, the account in the Supplemental Plan is required to be distributed to the participant. Portions of accounts invested in our common stock are
	distributed in shares of common stock and the remaining portions are distributed in cash. Distributions from the Supplemental Plan are subject to federal and state income tax withholding.






	The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan






	The EDCP provides senior officers designated by the Compensation Committee the opportunity to defer up to 90% of base salary, annual bonus compensation and certain equity awards. An election to defer can only
	be made on an annual basis and is generally irrevocable. Other than the

	one-time

	cash contribution made by Huntington in 2016 for Ms. Pierce, contributions to this plan consist of compensation deferred by
	the participants. Deferrals of common stock are held as common stock until distribution. Cash amounts deferred will accrue interest, earnings and losses based on the performance of the investment option selected by the participant and tracked by a
	book-keeping account. The investment options consist of common stock and a variety of mutual funds that are generally available and/or consistent with the types of investment options under the 401(k) Plan.




	At the time of each deferral election, a participant elects the method and timing of account distribution in the event of termination or retirement.
	In addition, a participant may elect an

	in-service

	distribution. Accounts distributed upon termination, retirement or

	in-service

	event may be distributed in a single
	lump sum payment or in substantially equal installments. A participant may request a hardship withdrawal prior to termination or retirement. In addition, for amounts earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004, a participant may obtain an

	in-service

	withdrawal subject to a 10% penalty and suspension of future contributions for at least 12 months. Cash that is deferred is paid out in cash, except that any cash that is invested in our common stock at
	the time of distribution is distributed in shares. Common stock that is deferred is distributed in kind.




	The table below sets forth the
	rate of return for the

	one-year

	period ending December 31, 2016 for each of the investment options under the EDCP.

	Years of credited service reported in the table are the final years of credited service, frozen as of December 31, 2013.




	 




	(2)


	This column reflects the actuarial present value of the executive officers accumulated benefit under the Retirement Plan and the SRIP as of December 31, 2016. The valuation method used to determine the
	benefit figures shown, and all material assumptions applied, are discussed in Note 16 Benefit Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.




	Only employees hired before January 1, 2010, are eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan, as frozen. Mr. McCullough, Ms. Pierce,
	Mr. Heller and Ms. Houston were hired after January 1, 2010 and are not eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan. Eligibility for participation in the SRIP is limited to employees eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan
	who (a) have been nominated by the Compensation Committee; and (b) earn compensation in excess of the limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) or whose benefit exceeds the limitation of Code Section 415(b).


	Benefits under both the Retirement Plan and the SRIP are based on levels of compensation and years of credited service. Benefits under the SRIP, however,
	are not limited by Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415(b). Code Section 401(a)(17) limits the annual amount of compensation that may be taken into account when calculating benefits under the Retirement Plan. For 2016, this limit was $265,000

	.

	Code Section 415 limits the annual benefit amount that a participant may receive under the Retirement Plan. For 2016, this amount was $210,000.


	The benefit formula under the Retirement Plan was previously revised for benefits earned beginning on January 1, 2010. While the change did not
	affect the benefit earned under the Retirement Plan through December 31, 2009, there was a reduction in future benefits. The benefit earned in the Retirement Plan prior to January 1, 2010 is based on compensation earned in the five
	consecutive highest years of service. For service on and after January 1, 2010 and through December 31, 2013, the benefit earned in the Retirement Plan is based on compensation earned each year. For executives who are eligible for
	retirement or early retirement, the benefit earned in the SRIP is based on compensation earned in the five consecutive highest years of service and the Retirement Plan formula in effect on December 31, 2009. For executives who are not eligible
	for retirement or early retirement, the accrued benefit under the SRIP is based on the Retirement Plan formula in effect on and after January 1, 2010. Compensation consists of base salary and 50% of overtime, bonuses, incentives and commissions
	paid pursuant to plans with a measurement period of one year or less. Bonuses are taken into account in the year paid rather than earned. A participant who is at least 55 years of age with at least 10 years of service may retire and receive an early
	retirement benefit, reduced to reflect the fact that he or she will be receiving payments over a longer period of time.

	The years of credited service have been capped for participants to the actual years of service with us
	through December 31, 2013, the date the plans were frozen. The maximum years of credited service recognized by the Retirement Plan and the SRIP is 40.


	Benefit figures shown are computed on the assumption that participants retire at age 65, the normal retirement age specified in the plans. The normal
	form of benefit under the Retirement Plan is a life annuity. The Retirement Plan offers additional forms of distribution that are actuarially equivalent to the life annuity. Benefits with a present value greater than the applicable dollar limit
	under Code Section 402(g) ($18,000 for 2016) are paid from the SRIP in the form of a life annuity. The SRIP also offers additional forms of distribution that are actuarially equivalent to the life annuity. Benefits with a present value equal to or
	less than the applicable dollar limit under Code Section 402(g) are paid in the form of a lump sum distribution.





	Payments upon
	Termination of Employment or Change in Control



	Each of our named executive officers has a change in control agreement with us referred to as an
	Executive Agreement. The purposes of these agreements are to encourage retention of our key executives and to provide protection from termination related to a change in control of our company. Huntingtons board of directors adopted the current
	forms of agreement in November 2012 when they were updated to more closely align with current best practices. The primary changes from the prior agreements were the elimination of the golden parachute excise tax

	gross-up

	provision and the elimination of a provision that provided the executive serving as chief executive officer with the right to terminate employment solely as a result of a


	change-in-control.


	In addition, the updated agreements contain restrictions relating to the disclosure of confidential information and competing with Huntington (three year

	non-competition

	for the chief executive officer, and one year

	non-competition

	for the other named executive officers, post termination).


	Huntington has an employment agreement with Mr. Steinour pursuant to which Mr. Steinour will continue to serve as Huntingtons president
	and chief executive officer through December 31, 2019. The agreement became effective December 1, 2012 for an initial three-year term, subject to three-year renewal periods upon expiration of the initial term and each renewal term, unless
	either party gives timely notice of nonrenewal. Mr. Steinours employment agreement provides for certain payments to him upon termination in certain situations other than a change in control.


	In addition, each of the named executive officers has outstanding RSU awards and PSU awards which may be subject to accelerated vesting upon involuntary
	termination (not for cause), death, or disability.




	Executive Agreements




	Under the Executive Agreements, change in control generally includes:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 25% or more of our outstanding voting securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a change in the composition of the board of directors if a majority of the new directors were not appointed or nominated by the directors currently sitting on the board of directors or their subsequent nominees;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a merger involving our company where our shareholders immediately prior to the merger own less than 51% of the combined voting power of the surviving entity immediately after the merger;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the dissolution of our company; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	a disposition of assets, reorganization, or other corporate event involving our company which would have the same effect as any of the above-described events.




	Under each Executive Agreement, we, or our successor, will provide severance benefits to the executive officer if his employment is terminated (other
	than on account of the officers death or disability or for cause):


	 




	 


	


	 


	by us, at any time within 24 months after a change in control;




	 




	 


	


	 


	by us, at any time prior to a change in control but after commencement of any discussions with a third party relating to a possible change in control involving such third party if the executive officers
	termination is in contemplation of such possible change in control and such change in control is actually consummated within 12 months after the date of such executive officers termination;




	 




	 


	


	 


	by the executive officer voluntarily with good reason at any time within 24 months after a change in control of our company; and




	 


	45







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	by the executive officer voluntarily with good reason at any time after commencement of change in control discussions if such change in control is actually
	consummated within 12 months after the date of such officers termination.







	Good reason generally means the
	assignment to the executive officer of duties which are materially different from such duties prior to the change in control, a reduction in such officers salary or benefits, or a demand to relocate to an unacceptable location, made by us or
	our successor either after a change in control or after the commencement of change in control discussions if such change or reduction is made in contemplation of a change in control and such change in control is actually consummated within 12 months
	after such change or reduction. An executive officers determination of good reason will be conclusive and binding upon the parties if made in good faith.




	In addition to any accrued salary and annual cash incentive payable as of termination, severance payments and benefits under the Executive Agreements consist of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a

	lump-sum

	cash payment equal to three times annual base salary for the chief executive officer and two and

	one-half

	times annual base salary for each of the other named executive officers;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a

	lump-sum

	cash payment equal to three times for the chief executive officer, and two and

	one-half

	times for the other named executive officers, of the greater of the executives target annual incentive award for the calendar year during which the change in control occurs or the immediately
	preceding calendar year, provided the executive was a participant in the Management incentive Plan during the calendar year, or the immediately preceding calendar year;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a

	pro-rata

	annual incentive award paid upon a change in control under the Management Incentive Plan based on either the
	actual level of


	year-to-date


	performance, or the target award as a percent of base salary for the plan year preceding the change in control, whichever is greater, in
	accordance with the terms of the Management Incentive Plan;






	 





	 




	




	 





	36 months of continued insurance benefits for the chief executive officer, and 30 months for the other named executive officers;






	 





	 




	




	 





	fees for outplacement services for the executive up to a maximum amount equal to 15% of the executives annual base salary plus reimbursement for job search
	travel expenses up to $5,000;






	 





	 




	




	 





	stock options, restricted stock, RSU, and PSU awards under our stock and incentive plans become vested according to the terms of the plans; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	other benefits to which the executive was otherwise entitled including perquisites, benefits, and service credit for benefits.







	The Executive Agreements also provide for 36 months of additional service credited for purposes of retirement benefits for the chief executive
	officer and 30 months for the other named executive officers. Because the Retirement Plan and the SRIP were frozen as of December 31, 2013, this provision will not operate to increase accrued benefits under these plans. Additional service and
	compensation earned after the freeze date are not included in the calculation of benefits under the Executive Agreements. The additional service period will count for purposes of determining vesting or entitlement to early retirement benefits under
	these plans.




	The Executive Agreements have a


	best-net-benefit


	clause which replaced the excise tax

	gross-ups.

	If an executive triggers the excise tax, the individual will
	either be

	cut-back

	to an amount that is $1 less than such amount that would cause the excise tax, or the executive will have the opportunity to pay the excise tax himself, depending on the result
	that provides the better

	after-tax

	result.




	For a period of five years after any termination of
	the executive officers employment, we will provide the executive officer with coverage under a standard directors and officers liability insurance policy at our expense, and will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the officer to
	the fullest extent permitted under Maryland law against all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by the officer in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding in which he may be involved by reason of having been a
	director or officer of our company or any subsidiary.




	In the event an executive officer is required to enforce any of the rights granted
	under his Executive Agreement, we, or our successor, will pay the cost of counsel (legal and accounting). In addition, the executive officer is entitled to prejudgment interest on any amounts found to be due in connection with any action taken to
	enforce such officers rights under the Executive Agreement.

	Table of Contents



	As a condition to receiving the payments and benefits under the Executive Agreements, the executive officer
	will be required to execute a release. Severance benefits payable in a lump sum will be paid not later than 45 business days following the date the executives employment terminates, subject to applicable laws and regulations.


	The Executive Agreements are extended annually and are subject to an extension for 24 months upon a change in control. An Executive Agreement will
	terminate if the executive officers employment terminates under circumstances that do not trigger benefits under the agreement. We may elect not to renew an agreement upon 30 days prior written notice.




	Sandra Pierce




	In connection with the
	completion of Huntingtons acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation, Huntington entered into a retention letter with Ms. Pierce. The retention letter provided that if Ms. Pierces employment was terminated by Huntington without cause or if
	she died or became disabled prior to February 16, 2017, Huntington would contribute a cash amount equal to $1,750,065 to her account under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that would become payable upon her separation from service with
	Huntington (the Contingent Cash Retention Award). This benefit was intended to make Ms. Pierce whole upon certain qualifying terminations of employment that may occur prior to February 16, 2017, because upon any termination of employment
	prior to February 16, 2017, Ms. Pierce would have forfeited her retention RSU award. As of February 16, 2017, Ms. Pierce is no longer eligible to receive the Contingent Cash Retention Award and her retention RSU award would vest in full upon a
	termination of her employment by Huntington without cause or her death or disability.


	In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement between
	Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation, upon the completion of Huntingtons acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation, FirstMerit determined the amount of fiscal year 2016 bonus payable to Ms. Pierce under its incentive plan. Such annual bonus would
	have been paid at the time Huntington pays annual cash bonuses to similarly situated employees, except that if Ms. Pierce was terminated without cause or resigned with good reason prior to the payment date, Ms. Pierce would have been eligible to
	receive her annual bonus for 2016 without proration.


	The estimated payments and benefits that would be paid in the event each named executive
	officer terminated employment on December 31, 2016 and became entitled to benefits under his or her Executive Agreement are set forth below. For purposes of quantifying these benefits, we assumed that a change in control occurred on
	December 31, 2016 and that the executive officers employment was terminated on that date without cause. The closing price of a share of our common stock on December 30, 2016, the last business day of the year, was $13.22.

	Mr. Steinours Employment Agreement




	Mr. Steinours employment agreement provides for certain payments upon a termination of his employment without cause or for
	good reason (each as defined in the agreement). The potential payments under these agreements are described and quantified below.


	Upon
	termination without cause or for good reason, Mr. Steinour is entitled to payment of the following amounts:


	 




	 


	


	 


	accrued amounts consisting of unpaid base salary through termination, earned but unpaid annual incentive payments for the prior period, accrued and unused paid time off and incurred but unreimbursed business expenses;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a

	pro-rata

	incentive payment in respect of the fiscal year of the company in which the date of termination occurs, with such amount to equal the amount determined by the
	Compensation Committee based on the Companys actual performance for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs and otherwise on a basis no less favorable than annual incentive award determinations are made by the Compensation
	Committee for the companys executive officers; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	a severance payment equal to two times his annual base salary and the higher of the target incentive payment for the year of termination or the incentive payment paid or payable with respect to the prior fiscal year;
	and




	Mr. Steinour would also be entitled to payment and provision of any other amounts or benefits to which he was otherwise entitled.


	If Mr. Steinour had terminated employment with us without cause or for good reason as of December 31, 2016, he would
	have been entitled to, in addition to accrued amounts and benefits, a pro rata annual incentive payment equal to $2,475,000 and a severance payment equal to $5,500,000.


	If Mr. Steinour had terminated employment as of December 31, 2016, due to death or disability, he or his estate would have been entitled to a
	pro rata annual incentive payment for the year of termination (based on the companys actual performance for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs and otherwise on a basis no less favorable than annual incentive award
	determinations are made by the Compensation Committee for the companys executive officers) equal to $2,475,000 and accrued obligations and benefits.


	If Mr. Steinour had terminated employment as of December 31, 2016 without good reason and due to his retirement, he would have been
	entitled to a pro rata annual incentive payment for the year of termination equal to $2,475,000. Mr. Steinour was not eligible for normal retirement benefits as of December 31, 2016.


	Severance benefits and payments are subject to execution and nonrevocation of a release of claims.




	RSUs and PSUs  Potential Accelerated Vesting




	Each of the named executive officers has outstanding RSU awards and PSU awards which are subject to accelerated vesting upon involuntary termination (not
	for cause), death or disability. The table below sets forth the value of the shares and accumulated dividends that would have been payable under outstanding grants of RSUs and PSUs to the respective officers upon involuntary termination (not for
	cause), death or disability as of December 31, 2016.

	(1)


	In the event accelerated vesting applies to a prorated award rather than the full award, the proration is based on the number of months from the grant date to the month of termination. Generally, in the event of
	proration of a PSU award, the proration is calculated on the target number of shares, subject to adjustment at the end of the performance cycle when the shares would be released along with all other PSU awards for the same cycle. Dividends for
	awards granted prior to May 1, 2015 are accumulated and paid in cash. Dividends for awards granted on or after May 1, 2015 are reinvested and accumulated as additional award shares.




	 




	(2)


	There is full forfeiture of any unvested awards in the event of termination for cause.




	 




	(3)


	Involuntary termination (not for cause) results in accelerated vesting of a prorated number of shares.




	 




	(4)


	Termination in the event of death results in acceleration in full for all awards granted on or after May 1, 2016, and acceleration of a prorated number of shares for all awards granted prior to May 1, 2016.
	PSUs granted on May 1, 2016 that are subject to accelerated vesting due to termination in the event of death are not subject to adjustment at the end of the performance cycle.




	 




	(5)


	Termination due to disability results in accelerated vesting of a prorated number of shares.




	 




	(6)


	Involuntary termination (not for cause), death or disability that, in each case, occurs on or following February 16, 2017, results in accelerated vesting of all shares.




	 




	(7)


	An award of restricted stock granted to Ms. Pierce by FirstMerit Corporation on April 1, 2016, was converted to a restricted stock award with respect to Huntington common stock upon the merger effective
	August 16, 2016, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the award as granted by FirstMerit Corporation. This award provides for acceleration in full in cases of death, disability, involuntary termination not for cause or
	termination for good reason.










	Proposal 1  Election of Directors



	The board of directors proposes the election of fifteen directors at this annual meeting. Directors elected at the meeting will each serve a

	one-year

	term expiring at our 2018 annual meeting when their successors are duly elected and qualify.


	Upon
	consultation with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the board of directors has nominated for election or reelection 15 of the 16 directors currently serving. Ann B. Crane, Steven G. Elliott, Michael J. Endres, Peter J. Kight,
	Jonathan A. Levy, Eddie R. Munson, Richard W. Neu, David L. Porteous, Kathleen H. Ransier, and Stephen D. Steinour were each elected at the 2016 annual meeting. Chris Inglis was appointed to the board of directors on May 5, 2016, and Lizabeth
	Ardisana, Robert S. Cubbin, Gina D. France and J. Michael Hochschwender were appointed to the board of directors effective August 16, 2016. John B. Gerlach, Jr., who joined the board in 1999, is stepping down.


	Unless otherwise directed, the shares represented by a properly submitted proxy will be voted FOR the election of each nominee. We have no reason to
	believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director if elected.


	 


	49







	Table of Contents



	However, in the event that any of these nominees should become unavailable, the board of directors may decrease the number of directors pursuant to the bylaws, or the board of directors may
	designate a substitute nominee, for whom shares represented by a properly submitted proxy would be voted.


	The board of directors recommends a vote


	FOR


	the election of each of the nominees for director.



	Nominee Information



	All of our nominees are seasoned leaders. Collectively they bring to our board a wide variety of skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives. We also
	have a mix of newer and longer-term directors among the nominees. See the chart under Director Nomination and Board Evaluation above which summarizes the experience, background, tenure and age of the directors. The following provides
	biographical information regarding each of the nominees, including their specific business experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that the directors considered, in addition to their prior service on the board, when the board determined to
	nominate them.

	Proposal 2  Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public
	Accounting Firm



	The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent
	registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee regularly evaluates the qualifications, performance, and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, and whether the independent registered public accounting firm should
	be rotated.


	The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2017.
	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as our independent accountant since 2015. The Audit Committee and the board of directors believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as our independent registered public
	accounting firm is in the best interests of the company and its investors. Although not required, we are asking shareholders to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for 2017
	because we value our shareholders views on the companys independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate governance. The Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP if its
	selection is not ratified by the shareholders.


	Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regularly attend meetings of the Audit Committee and
	will be present at the annual meeting. These representatives will have an opportunity at the annual meeting to make a statement if they desire to do so and also will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

	Audit fees are fees for professional services rendered for the integrated audits of our annual consolidated financial statements, including the audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
	reporting, quarterly reviews of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Form

	10-Q

	filings, and services that are normally provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in connection with
	statutory/subsidiary financial statement audits, attestation reports required by statute or regulation, and comfort letters and consents related to SEC filings.




	 




	(2)


	Audit-related fees generally include fees for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services include attestation and agreed-upon
	procedures which address accounting, reporting and control matters that are not required by statute or regulation, pension plans and service organization control examinations. These services are normally provided in connection with the recurring
	audit engagement.




	 




	(3)


	The

	tax-related

	services were all in the nature of tax compliance or consultation and advice on business tax matters related to the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation.




	 




	(4)


	All other fees were generally for advisory services rendered in support of certain operational assessments of our broker-dealer subsidiary.







	Pre-Approval

	Policies and Procedures




	The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm. The
	Audit Committee has a policy that it will

	pre-approve

	all audit and

	non-audit

	services provided by the independent accountant

	,

	and will not engage the independent
	accountant to perform any specific

	non-audit

	services prohibited by law or regulation. The Audit Committee has given general

	pre-approval

	for specified audit,
	audit-related and tax services. The terms of any general

	pre-approval

	is 12 months from the date of

	pre-approval,

	unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a
	different term. The Audit Committee will annually review the services for which general

	pre-approval

	is given. The Audit Committee may revise the list of general

	pre-approved

	services from time to


	 


	63







	Table of Contents



	time, based upon subsequent determinations. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent accountant has received general

	pre-approval,

	it
	will require specific

	pre-approval

	by the Audit Committee.

	Pre-approval

	fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent accountant are established annually
	by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels will require specific

	pre-approval

	by the Audit Committee.


	The Audit Committee may delegate

	pre-approval

	authority to a member of its committee, and has currently delegated

	pre-approval

	authority to its chairman. The decisions of the chairman or other member to whom

	pre-approval

	authority is delegated must be presented to the full Audit
	Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services covered by the fees disclosed above were

	pre-approved

	by the Audit Committee or its chairman. The Audit Committee does not delegate its
	responsibilities to

	pre-approve

	services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management. The Audit Committee has considered and determined that the services described above are
	compatible with maintaining the independent accountants independence.


	The board of directors recommends a vote


	FOR


	the
	ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.








	Proposal 3  Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation



	As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance.
	Our program places heavy emphasis on performance-based compensation, particularly in the form of long-term incentives. We continually strengthen our compensation practices based on our philosophy, market best practices and feedback received from
	shareholders. Our compensation policies, practices and decisions for executive officers are described in detail under Compensation of Executive Officers above.


	We believe that our compensation policies and procedures strongly align the interests of executives and shareholders. We encourage our executives to
	focus on long-term performance with long-term incentives and also stock ownership and retention requirements. We further believe that our culture focuses executives on sound risk management and appropriately rewards executives for performance. The
	resolution set forth below gives the shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of our executives. Consideration of this resolution is required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	Upon the recommendation of the board of directors, we ask shareholders to consider adoption of the following resolution:



	RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated as disclosed in this proxy statement
	pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation

	S-K,

	including in the Summary Compensation Table, the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the additional compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosure,
	is hereby approved on an advisory,

	non-binding

	basis.



	Because this is an advisory vote, it will
	not bind the board of directors, however, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.


	The board of directors recommends a vote


	FOR


	the adoption of the resolution regarding executive compensation, as set forth above.





	Proposal 4  Advisory Recommendation on the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation



	At this annual meeting, shareholders will have the opportunity to consider the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation,
	as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation

	S-K.

	Shareholders may vote on a

	non-binding,

	advisory basis, to recommend that the shareholder advisory vote on executive
	compensation occur every 1, 2 or 3 calendar years, or may abstain from voting on this proposal. The proposal regarding the frequency of shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation is also advisory and will not bind the board of directors.
	This advisory vote is required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	Shareholders last considered the frequency of future
	shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation in 2011. Following that vote, the board of directors determined that it would include a

	non-binding

	advisory vote on executive compensation in its proxy
	materials pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on an annual basis until the next vote on the frequency of such advisory votes.


	The board of directors recommends that shareholders vote to recommend that the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation occur


	EVERY




	YEAR


	.

	Huntington or its affiliated entities and are receiving this proxy statement as a result of your participation in the Huntington Investment and Tax Savings Plan or the FirstMerit Corporation and Subsidiaries Employees Salary Savings Retirement
	Plan, a proxy card has not been included. Instead, an instruction card, similar to a proxy card, has been provided so that you may instruct the trustee how to vote your shares held under this plan. Please refer to your instruction card for
	information on instructing the trustee electronically over the Internet or by telephone.


	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted
	householding rules which permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements, notices of internet availability of proxy materials, and annual reports (annual meeting materials) with
	respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering one copy of annual meeting materials to these shareholders. Unless we have received contrary instructions, we will deliver only one copy of the annual meeting materials to
	multiple security holders sharing an address. If we sent only one set of these documents to your household and one or more of you would prefer to receive your own set, we will deliver promptly upon request additional copies of the annual meeting
	materials. Please contact our transfer agent, Computershare, to receive additional copies of the annual meeting materials. Also please contact Computershare if you would like to request separate copies of future annual meeting materials, or if you
	are receiving multiple copies of annual meeting materials and you would like to request delivery of just one copy. You may contact Computershare by telephone at

	(877) 282-1168

	or by mail at Computershare
	Investor Services, P.O. Box 30170, College Station, TX 77842-3170. If you hold your shares in street name, please contact your bank, broker or other holder of record to request information about householding.

Huntington Bancshares upgraded to buy from neutral at Hilliard Lyons

Breaking            
Bank shares lead stock-market gainers in early trade after Fed 'stress test'
Shares of the U.S.'s biggest banks were jumping early Thursday, putting the financial sector on pace to post the best daily gain in about three weeks, according to FactSet data. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  was rising 1.7%, led by advances in Regions Financial Corp. , Huntington Bancshares Inc.  and Comerica Inc. . Some of the biggest banks passed a test by the Federal Reserve of the industry's ability to withstand market shocks. Yesterday, all 34 banks received a greenlight to pay out money to its shareholders, including dividends and buybacks. Gains in the bank-focused ETF put it on pace to book its best one-day rise since June 9. Bank shares also were getting a lift from rising government bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury note  offering 2.29% from 2.1456% at the start of the week. Higher yields are supportive to bank's lending business. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  were contributing 33 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average  in early trade, but the market under pressure as technology stocks limped lower after Wednesday's rally. The tech-focused Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  was off 1.2%, weighing on the Nasdaq Composite Index , which was down 0.8% in early trade. The S&P 500 index  was off 0.3% in early trade.

	Item 8.01 Other Events.


	On March 30, 2012, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington) announced that it has purchased Fidelity Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Fidelity Bank was closed on March 30, 2012 by the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver.


	Subsequently, the FDIC sold the 15-branch bank to Huntington. Effective Saturday, March 31, 2012, all of Fidelity Bank branches will open as Huntington branches. Huntington currently has 50 banking offices in Southeast Michigan, more than 115 in Michigan and more than 600 branches throughout the Midwest. As of Mar. 9, 2012, Fidelity Bank had approximately $0.8 billion in assets and $0.7 billion of deposits.


	The acquisition of the banking operations of Fidelity Bank is structured as an assisted whole bank purchase and assumption transaction without a loss share agreement. Huntington has completed due diligence on more than half of the loan portfolio, resulting in an acquisition asset discount of approximately $150 million. In 2012, the transaction is expected to be over 2% accretive to earnings per share, less than 1% accretive to tangible book value, and very modestly dilutive to Huntington’s capital ratios. Due to the fill-in nature of Fidelity Bank’s branch network, the transaction is expected to exceed internal hurdles for financial returns.

	HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES PURCHASES FIDELITY BANK IN SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN





	Acquisition expands Huntingtons presence in Southeast Michigan



	COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Nasdaq: HBAN;

	www.huntington.com

	)
	announced today that it has purchased Fidelity Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
	(FDIC). Fidelity Bank was closed earlier this evening by the Michigan Office of Financial and
	Insurance Regulation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the
	receiver.

	Subsequently, the FDIC sold the 15-branch bank to Huntington. Effective Saturday, March 31, 2012,
	all of Fidelity Bank branches will open as Huntington branches. Huntington currently has 50 banking
	offices in Southeast Michigan, more than 115 in Michigan and more than 600 branches throughout the
	Midwest. As of Mar. 9, 2012, Fidelity Bank had approximately $0.8 billion in assets and $0.7
	billion of deposits.

	The acquisition of the banking operations of Fidelity Bank is structured as an assisted whole bank
	purchase and assumption transaction without a loss share agreement. Huntington has completed due
	diligence on more than half of the loan portfolio, resulting in an acquisition asset discount of
	approximately $150 million. In 2012, the transaction is expected to be over 2% accretive to
	earnings per share, less than 1% accretive to tangible book value, and very modestly dilutive to
	Huntingtons capital ratios. Due to the fill-in nature of Fidelity Banks branch network, the
	transaction is expected to exceed internal hurdles for financial returns.

	We are pleased to welcome the more than 18,000 customers of Fidelity Bank to Huntington, which has
	been a leader in investing in Michigan, said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president, and chief
	executive officer of Huntington. Our new customers will now have access to a broader range of
	products and some of the highest rated customer service in the industry.

	Customers will be able to sign up for Asterisk Free Checking

	TM-


	an account that has no minimum balance requirement and comes with 24-Hour Grace

	®

	overdraft protection, identity theft protection and platinum debit cards, among other features.

	Starting tomorrow, the former Fidelity Bank customers will continue to conduct banking business at
	their existing banking offices with familiar employees. Then beginning on April 13, 2012, customers
	will have access to Huntingtons entire 1,300 ATM network throughout the Midwest, with no service
	charge, including the 52 ATMs in East Michigan. Then in late June, their existing accounts will be
	converted to Huntingtons systems.

	Our new customers can be assured we will communicate details as soon as they are available, and we
	will work hard to make certain the transition is as smooth and seamless as possible, added
	Steinour.

	Todays announcement is a continuation of Huntingtons ongoing investment in Michigan. In June
	2011, the bank committed $2 billion in lending to Michigan businesses. More than $1 billion of the
	money has already been lent. Earlier this month, the bank committed $100 million to affordable
	housing in Michigan that is aimed at helping families throughout the state.

	Depositors who have questions may call their local banking office during normal business hours or
	Huntington at 1-866-375-6502, Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. EDT and on
	Saturday and Sunday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EDT. They may also visit Huntingtons web site any

	Forward-looking Statement


	This document contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations,
	goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and
	uncertainties. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate,
	believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional
	verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations.


	While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete,
	below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
	contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) worsening of credit quality performance
	due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could prove less valuable
	than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in economic
	conditions, including impacts from the continuing economic uncertainty in the US, the European
	Union, and other areas; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product
	pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market

	Huntington Bancshares Incorporated




	14,000,000 Depositary Shares, Each Representing a 1/40th Interest in a Share of




	6.250% Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock



	Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is offering 14,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 6.250%
	Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share) (the Preferred Stock). As a holder of depositary shares, you will be
	entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). You must exercise such rights through Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Computershare Inc., jointly as
	the depositary for the shares of the Preferred Stock.


	Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly in arrears, when, as and
	if authorized by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board and declared by us, at an annual rate of 6.250% per year on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, equivalent to $25 per depositary share. The dividend
	payment dates will be the fifteenth day of each January, April, July and October, commencing on July 15, 2016, or the next business day if any such day is not a business day.


	Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be non-cumulative. If for any reason our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board
	does not authorize and we do not declare full cash dividends on the Preferred Stock for a quarterly dividend period, we will have no obligation to pay any dividends for that period, whether or not our board of directors or a duly authorized
	committee of our board authorizes and we declare dividends on the Preferred Stock for any subsequent dividend period. However, with certain limited exceptions, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the
	Preferred Stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, our common stock or other junior securities during the next succeeding dividend period.


	The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. We may redeem the Preferred Stock at our option, (i) in whole or in part, from
	time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after April 15, 2021 or (ii) in whole but not in part, within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as defined herein), in each case, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per
	share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends and, in the case of a redemption following a regulatory capital treatment event, the pro rated portion of dividends, whether or not declared, for the dividend
	period in which such redemption occurs. If we redeem the Preferred Stock, the depositary will redeem a proportional number of depositary shares. Neither the holders of Preferred Stock nor holders of depositary shares will have the right to require
	the redemption or repurchase of the Preferred Stock or the depositary shares. Any redemption of the Preferred Stock is subject to our receipt of any required prior approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal
	Reserve).


	The Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as set forth under Description of the Preferred
	StockVoting Rights on

	page S-19.



	We intend to apply to list the depositary shares
	on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol HBANO. If the application is approved, we expect trading of the depositary shares on the NASDAQ to begin within the 30-day period after the initial delivery of the
	depositary shares.



	Investing in the depositary shares involves risks. See 

	Risk Factors

	
	beginning on page S-7 of this prospectus supplement and in Item 1-ARisk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
	SEC) to read about factors you should consider before investing in the depositary shares.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference contain certain
	forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including
	statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate,
	plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar
	variations. The forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


	While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause
	actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less
	valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows that may be worse than expected; (2) changes in economic, political, or industry conditions, uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the
	Federal Reserve, volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies,
	including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our Fair Play banking philosophy; (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our
	financial statements; (7) extended disruption of vital infrastructure; (8) the final outcome of significant litigation or adverse legal developments in the proceedings; (9) the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental
	actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the Office
	of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; (10) the possibility that the proposed acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation does not close when
	expected or at all because required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; (11) the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the
	acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of us and FirstMerit Corporation or as a result of the strength of the economy and
	competitive factors in the areas where we and FirstMerit Corporation do business; (12) the possibility that the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected
	factors or events; (13) diversion of managements attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities as a result of the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation; (14) potential adverse reactions or changes to business or
	employee relationship, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation; (15) and our ability to complete the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit Corporation successfully.
	Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents subsequently filed by us with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update any
	forward-looking statements. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, look under the captions Forward-Looking Statements and
	Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC, and in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.


	We encourage you to understand forward-looking statements to be strategic objectives rather than absolute forecasts of future performance. All
	forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the
	forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against
	placing undue reliance on such statements. Please carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this document, in the accompanying prospectus and in our other reports filed with the SEC for more information about the risks and other
	factors that may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

	Huntington Bancshares Incorporated



	We are a regional bank holding company organized under Maryland law and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. The Huntington National Bank, founded
	in 1866, and its subsidiaries (the Bank) and affiliates provide full-service commercial, small business, and consumer banking services; mortgage banking services; treasury management and foreign exchange services; equipment leasing;
	wealth and investment management services; trust services; brokerage services; customized insurance brokerage and service programs; and other financial products and services. The principal market for these services is our six-state banking
	franchise: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The primary distribution channels include a banking network of more than 750 traditional branches and convenience branches located in grocery stores and retirement
	centers, and through an array of alternative distribution channels including internet and mobile banking, telephone banking, and more than 1,500 ATMs. Through automotive dealership relationships within its six-state banking franchise area and
	selected other Midwest and New England states, we also provide commercial banking services to the automotive dealers and retail automobile financing for dealer customers.


	As a registered financial holding company, we are subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve. We are required to file with the Federal
	Reserve reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries.


	At
	December 31, 2015, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of approximately $71.0 billion, total deposits of approximately $55.3 billion and total shareholders equity of approximately $6.6 billion.


	Our principal executive offices are located at 41 South High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43287, and our telephone number is (614) 480-8300.



	Recent Developments




	Merger



	On January 25, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with FirstMerit
	Corporation (FirstMerit), an Ohio corporation and the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, N.A. (FirstMerit Bank), and West Subsidiary Corporation (Merger Sub), an Ohio corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary,
	under which FirstMerit will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction expected to be valued at approximately $3.4 billion based on the closing share price of Huntington common stock on the day preceding the announcement. The Merger
	Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into FirstMerit, with FirstMerit as the surviving corporation in the merger (the Merger). As soon as reasonably
	practicable thereafter, FirstMerit will merge with and into

	Table of Contents





	Huntington, with Huntington as the surviving corporation. Immediately following the merger of FirstMerit into Huntington, or at such later time as we may determine in our sole discretion,
	FirstMerits wholly-owned bank subsidiary, FirstMerit Bank, will merge with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving entity.


	FirstMerit is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Akron, Ohio, with reported assets of approximately $25.5 billion as of
	December 31, 2015, and 366 banking offices and 400 ATM locations in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. FirstMerit provides a complete range of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its core
	operations. Principal affiliates include: FirstMerit Bank and FirstMerit Mortgage Corporation.


	Under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
	shareholders of FirstMerit will receive 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5.00 in cash for each share of FirstMerit common stock. Additionally, each share of 5.875% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, without par value, of
	FirstMerit will be converted into the right to receive a share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Huntington having such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, taken as a whole, not
	materially less favorable to such holders than such FirstMerit preferred stock. The transaction is expected to be completed in the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and
	the approval of the issuance of Huntington common stock by Huntingtons shareholders and the approval of the Merger by FirstMerits shareholders.


	This offering of depositary shares is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.



	Notes Offering



	On March 9, 2016, we
	commenced a public offering (the Notes Offering) for $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.15% Senior Notes due 2021 (the Notes), which Notes are expected to be issued on March 14, 2016. The proceeds of the
	Notes Offering will be used by us for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding asset growth of our subsidiaries. This offering of depositary shares is not conditioned on the consummation of the Notes Offering.

	14,000,000 depositary shares (16,100,000 depositary shares if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional depositary shares), each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 6.250% Series D
	Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. Each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights
	and preferences of the Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). We may, from time to time, elect to issue additional depositary shares representing shares of the Preferred Stock and all
	additional shares would be deemed to form a single series with the Preferred Stock.



 
	






	Dividends




	Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly in arrears, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board and declared by us out of legally available funds at an annual rate of 6.250%
	on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share.




 
	



 
	


	Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be non-cumulative. If for any reason our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board does not authorize and we do not declare full cash dividends on the Preferred
	Stock for a quarterly dividend period, we will have no obligation to pay any dividends for that period, whether or not our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board authorizes and we declare dividends on the Preferred Stock for
	any subsequent dividend period.



 
	



 
	


	Any dividends paid will be distributed to holders of depositary shares in the manner described under Description of the Depositary SharesDividends and Other Distributions below.



 
	






	Dividend Payment Dates




	January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year (or the following business day if such date is not a business day), commencing on July 15, 2016.



 
	



 
	



	A dividend period is each period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the following dividend payment date,




 
	





 
	


	S-3






	Table of Contents






 
	



	except that the initial dividend period will commence on and include the date on which shares of the Preferred Stock are first issued to but excluding July 15, 2016.




 
	








	Dividend Stopper




	With certain limited exceptions, if we have not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the Preferred Stock for a particular dividend period, we may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire,
	our common stock or other junior securities during the next succeeding dividend period.



 
	






	Redemption




	We may redeem the Preferred Stock at our option, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after April 15, 2021 or (ii) in whole but not in part, within 90 days following a regulatory capital
	treatment event (as defined herein), at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends and, in the case of a redemption following a regulatory capital treatment event,
	the pro rated portion of dividends, whether or not declared, for the dividend period in which such redemption occurs. If we redeem the Preferred Stock, the depositary will redeem a proportional number of depositary shares. Neither the holders of
	Preferred Stock nor holders of depositary shares will have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Preferred Stock.




 
	



 
	


	Any redemption of the Preferred Stock is subject to our receipt of any required prior approval by the Federal Reserve and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital guidelines or regulations of the
	Federal Reserve applicable to redemption of the Preferred Stock.



 
	








	Maturity




	The Preferred Stock does not have a maturity date, and we are not required to redeem the Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless and until we decide to
	redeem it.



 
	






	Liquidation Rights




	Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, out of our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders, before any distribution is made
	to holders of our common stock or other junior securities, a liquidating distribution in the amount of $1,000 per share of the Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share) plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of
	any undeclared dividends. Distributions will be made pro rata as to the Preferred Stock and any other parity securities and only to the extent of our assets, if any, that are available after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors.



 
	






	Voting Rights





	Holders of the Preferred Stock will have no voting rights, except with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the Preferred Stock and certain other matters. In addition, if
	dividends on the Preferred Stock are not paid in full for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the holders of the Preferred Stock, acting as a





 
	





 
	


	S-4






	Table of Contents






 
	



	single class with any other parity securities having similar voting rights, will have the right to elect two directors to our board. The terms of office of these directors will end when we have
	paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends for four consecutive dividend periods and all dividends on any parity securities have been paid in full. See Description of the Preferred StockVoting Rights.




 
	



 
	


	Holders of depositary shares must act through the depositary to exercise any voting rights, as described under Description of the Depositary SharesVoting the Preferred Stock below.



 
	








	Ranking




	The Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, senior to our common stock and each other class or series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the
	terms of which do not expressly provide that it ranks on a parity with or senior to the Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on our liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. The Preferred Stock will rank on a parity with (A) our
	8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share and liquidation value per share of $1,000, (B) our Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share and
	liquidation value per share of $1,000, and (C) each class or series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to dividend
	rights and rights on our liquidation, winding up and dissolution.




 
	








	Preemptive Rights




	None.



 
	






	Listing




	We intend to apply for listing of the depositary shares on the NASDAQ under the symbol HBANO. If the application is approved, we expect trading of the depositary shares on the NASDAQ to commence within a 30-day period after the
	initial delivery of the depositary shares.



 
	






	Use of Proceeds




	We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $338.1 million (or approximately $388.8 million if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional depositary shares), after
	underwriting commissions and expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, supporting asset growth of our subsidiaries. The precise amounts and timing of the
	application of proceeds will depend on the requirements of Huntington and its subsidiaries and affiliates. See Use of Proceeds. This offering of the depositary shares is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

	RISK FACTORS




	An investment in our depositary shares involves certain risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the risk factors
	included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, before making an investment
	decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This prospectus supplement also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual
	results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.




	Risks Related to the Preferred Stock and the Related Depositary Shares





	You are making an investment decision about the depositary shares as well as our Preferred Stock.




	As described in this prospectus supplement, we are issuing depositary shares representing proportional interests in shares of our Preferred
	Stock. The depositary will rely solely on the dividend payments on the Preferred Stock it receives from us to fund all dividend payments on the depositary shares. You should review carefully the information in this prospectus supplement regarding
	our depositary shares and the Preferred Stock.




	The Preferred Stock is an equity security and is subordinate to our existing and future
	indebtedness.




	The shares of the Preferred Stock are our equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. This means that the
	Preferred Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in our liquidation. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict payment of
	dividends on the Preferred Stock. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock like the Preferred Stock, (1) dividends are payable only if
	authorized by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board of directors and declared by us and (2) as a corporation, we are subject to restrictions on dividend payments and redemption payments out of lawfully available
	assets. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of any senior preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our Preferred Stock. Further,
	the Preferred Stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the limited voting rights referred to below under Holders of the Preferred
	Stock will have limited voting rights.




	Dividends on the Preferred Stock are discretionary and non-cumulative.




	Dividends on the Preferred Stock are discretionary and non-cumulative. Consequently, if our board of directors or a duly authorized committee
	of our board of directors does not authorize and we do not declare a dividend for any dividend period prior to the related dividend payment date, holders of the Preferred Stock would not be entitled to receive a dividend for that dividend period,
	and the unpaid dividend will cease to accrue and be payable. We will have no obligation to pay dividends accumulated for a dividend period after the dividend payment date for that period if our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of
	our board of directors has not authorized and we have not declared a dividend before the related dividend payment date, whether or not dividends on the Preferred Stock or any other class or series of our preferred stock or our common stock are
	authorized and declared for any future dividend period.




	Investors should not expect us to redeem the Preferred Stock on the date it becomes
	redeemable at our election or on any particular date after it becomes redeemable at our election.




	The Preferred Stock is a
	perpetual equity security. This means that it has no maturity or mandatory redemption date and is not redeemable at the option of investors, including the holders of the depositary shares.

 
	


	S-7






	Table of Contents



	The Preferred Stock may be redeemed by us at our option, either in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after April 15, 2021 or upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events,
	each as described below under Description of the Preferred StockRedemption. Any decision we may make at any time to propose a redemption of the Preferred Stock will depend upon, among other things, our evaluation of our capital
	position, the composition of our stockholders equity, applicable law and general market conditions at that time.


	Our right to
	redeem the Preferred Stock is subject to limitations. Under the Federal Reserves risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Preferred Stock is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. We
	cannot assure you that the Federal Reserve will approve any redemption of the Preferred Stock that we may propose.




	If we are deferring payments on
	our outstanding junior subordinated notes or are in default under the indentures governing those securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions on or redeeming the Preferred Stock.




	The terms of our outstanding junior subordinated notes prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our preferred
	stock, including the Preferred Stock, or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on the Preferred Stock, if an event of default under the indenture governing those junior subordinated notes has occurred and is continuing or
	at any time when we have deferred payment of interest on those junior subordinated notes.




	Holders of the Preferred Stock will have limited voting
	rights.




	Holders of the Preferred Stock will have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of
	voting stockholders. Holders of the Preferred Stock will have voting rights only as specifically required by the terms of the Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of the Preferred StockVoting Rights. Holders of
	depositary shares must act through the depositary to exercise any voting rights of the Preferred Stock.




	Our ability to pay dividends depends upon
	the results of operations of our subsidiaries.




	We are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through
	our bank and non-bank subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on the Preferred Stock will depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. If we do not receive sufficient cash
	dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, it is unlikely that we will have sufficient funds to make dividend payments on the Preferred Stock.


	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to provide us with funds to make dividend
	payments on the Preferred Stock, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any dividend payments, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries in the future will require the generation of future
	earnings by our subsidiaries and may require regulatory approval. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to us, as well as by us to our stockholders. The Bank may not, without prior regulatory
	approval, pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits. If the Bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient capital is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments on the Preferred Stock.


	In addition, our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiarys liquidation or
	otherwise will generally be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. Your ability as a holder of the depositary shares representing the Preferred Stock to benefit indirectly from that distribution also will be subject to these
	prior claims. As a result, the Preferred Stock will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries, including deposits. You should look only to our assets as the source of payment for the
	depositary shares representing the Preferred Stock.

	Table of Contents





	Our ability to pay dividends on the Preferred Stock, and therefore your ability to receive distributions on
	the depositary shares, may be limited by federal regulatory considerations.




	Our ability to make dividend payments may also be
	restricted by federal regulations applicable to us as a bank holding company and to our banking subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) requires federal banking agencies to
	establish more stringent risk-based capital guidelines and leverage limits applicable to banks and bank holding companies, and especially those institutions with consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion. The federal banking agencies
	have approved final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions regulatory capital guidelines in the United States, including the reforms known as Basel III. The Federal Reserves final rule sets forth the proposed
	criteria for qualifying additional Tier 1 capital instruments consistent with Basel III, including the requirement that any dividends on such instruments be paid out of the banking organizations net income, retained earnings and surplus, if
	any, related to additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and introduces a new capital conservation buffer requirement. The failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer, once effective, may result in limitations or restrictions on the ability of
	Huntington and our banking subsidiaries to make capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends. In addition, under its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies,
	including us, to submit annual capital plans and to obtain non-objection or regulatory approval before making capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends. The Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that
	the covered bank holding company will maintain minimum capital ratios on a pro forma basis under expected and stressed conditions throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. The Federal Reserve has also instructed that
	capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny. Federal banking laws also regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by our banking subsidiaries without prior
	regulatory approval. The above or any future rules, regulations or capital distribution constraints could adversely affect the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, our ability to pay dividends on the Preferred Stock and your
	ability to receive distributions on the depositary shares.




	An active trading market for the Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares does
	not exist and may not develop and the market price and liquidity of the depositary shares may be adversely affected.




	The Preferred
	Stock and the related depositary shares are new issues of securities with no established trading market. We plan to apply for the listing of the depositary shares representing proportional interests in our Preferred Stock on the NASDAQ. However, we
	cannot be certain that the depositary shares will qualify for listing. If they do not qualify for listing, or if an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any of the depositary shares representing proportional
	interests in our Preferred Stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the depositary shares will lead to the development of an active trading market on the NASDAQ, any other national securities exchange or otherwise, or how
	liquid that market might become. If an active, liquid market does not develop for the depositary shares, the market price and liquidity of the depositary shares may be adversely affected.




	Holders of depositary shares may be unable to use the dividends received deduction.




	Distributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the depositary shares may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction if we have current
	or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although we presently have accumulated earnings and profits, we may not have sufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits during future taxable years
	for the distributions on the Preferred Stock to qualify, in whole or in part, as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations. There may also be future changes in tax law that impact
	the availability of the dividends-received deduction. If any distributions on the Preferred Stock with respect to any taxable year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and
	profits or otherwise, the market value of the depositary shares may decline.

 
	


	S-9






	Table of Contents





	Additional issuances of preferred stock or securities convertible into preferred stock may further dilute
	existing holders of our Preferred Stock.




	We may, in the future, determine that it is advisable, or we may encounter circumstances
	where we determine it is necessary, to issue additional shares of preferred stock, securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of preferred stock, or preferred stock-equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business
	needs or to build additional capital. Our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. Our board of directors also has
	the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our Preferred Stock with respect to dividends or upon our
	dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. Though the approval of a supermajority of the holders of Preferred Stock will be needed to issue any equity security ranking above the Preferred Stock, if we issue preferred stock in the
	future that has a preference over our Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the Preferred Stock, the rights of holders of our
	Preferred Stock or the market price of our Preferred Stock could be adversely affected. The market price of our Preferred Stock could decline as a result of sales of Preferred Stock made after this offering or other offerings, as well as other sales
	of a large block of shares of our Preferred Stock or similar securities in the market thereafter, or the perception that such sales could occur. We may need to increase our authorized capital in order to raise such equity capital.




	One rating agency is expected to rate the Preferred Stock below investment grade.




	Because one rating agency is expected to assign the Preferred Stock a non-investment grade rating, the depositary shares may be subject to a
	higher risk of price volatility than similar, higher-rated securities. Furthermore, increases in leverage or deteriorating outlooks for an issuer, or volatile markets, could lead to continued significant deterioration in market prices of
	below-investment grade rated securities.


	Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies and such ratings could
	at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. Further, a rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Preferred Stock and related depositary
	shares. In addition, ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor and any rating of Preferred Stock may not reflect all risks related to Huntington and its business, or the structure or market value of
	the Preferred Stock



	Risks Related to the Merger





	Regulatory approvals for the acquisition of FirstMerit may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not
	presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisition.




	Before our
	acquisition of FirstMerit (the FirstMerit acquisition) may be completed, we and FirstMerit must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the United States Department of Justice.
	Other approvals, waivers, or consents from regulators may also be required. An adverse development in either partys regulatory standing or the factors considered by relevant governmental authorities could result in an inability to obtain
	approval or delay receipt of required approvals. The relevant governmental entities may impose conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business or require branch divestitures or changes to
	the terms of the FirstMerit acquisition. There can be no assurance that relevant government entities will not impose conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not
	have the effect of delaying the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition, imposing material additional costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the FirstMerit acquisition or otherwise reduce the anticipated
	benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition. Additionally, the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would
	prohibit or make illegal the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition.

 
	


	S-10






	Table of Contents





	The success of the FirstMerit acquisition and integration of Huntington and FirstMerit will depend on a
	number of uncertain factors.




	The success of the FirstMerit acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including, without
	limitation:

 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	our ability to integrate the business acquired from FirstMerit Bank in the FirstMerit acquisition (the acquired business) into the Banks current operations;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired business and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired in the FirstMerit acquisition;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	our ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired business in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	our ability to retain and attract the key employees and appropriate personnel;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	our ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired business;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	our ability to retain the customer relationships from the acquired business; and



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	the possibility that divestitures may be required by regulatory authorities in certain markets in which we and FirstMerit compete.




	Integrating the acquired business will be an operation of substantial size and expense, and may be affected by general market and economic
	conditions or government actions affecting the financial industry generally. Integration efforts will also likely divert our managements attention and resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate the acquired business
	successfully, and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships
	with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and
	financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of the acquired business will not adversely affect our existing profitability, that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those
	achieved by our existing banking business, or that we will be able to manage any growth resulting from the FirstMerit acquisition effectively.




	Combining Huntington and FirstMerit may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the
	acquisition may not be realized.




	Huntington and FirstMerit have operated and, until the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition,
	will continue to operate, independently. The success of the FirstMerit acquisition, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business and FirstMerits
	business in a manner that permits growth opportunities, and does not materially disrupt existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of
	key employees, the disruption of either companys ongoing businesses, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect the combined companys ability to maintain relationships with clients,
	customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the FirstMerit acquisition. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business, which could have an
	adverse effect on our financial results. If we experience difficulties with the integration process and attendant systems conversion, the anticipated benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to
	realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us and/or FirstMerit to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and/or FirstMerit and move their
	business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management

 
	


	S-11






	Table of Contents



	attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of FirstMerit and us during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the
	FirstMerit acquisition on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost savings of the FirstMerit acquisition could be less than anticipated.




	We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the FirstMerit acquisition is pending.




	Uncertainty about the effect of the FirstMerit acquisition on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may
	impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel until the FirstMerit acquisition is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain
	employees by us may be challenging while the FirstMerit acquisition is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty
	and difficulty of integration, or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $338.1 million (or approximately $388.8 million if the underwriters
	exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional depositary shares), after underwriting commissions and expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other
	things, supporting asset growth of our subsidiaries. The precise amounts and timing of the application of proceeds will depend on the requirements of Huntington and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This offering of the depositary shares is not
	conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK



	This prospectus supplement summarizes specific terms and provisions of the Preferred Stock. Terms that apply generally to our preferred stock
	are described under Description of Huntington Capital StockPreferred Stock. The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
	the pertinent sections of our charter, including the articles supplementary classifying the Preferred Stock, which are incorporated by reference in the registration statement that we have filed with the SEC or which will be included in filings with
	the SEC. You should read our charter, including the articles supplementary, for the provisions that are important to you.




	General




	Our charter authorizes the issuance of 6,617,808 shares of serial preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. When issued, the Preferred Stock
	will constitute a single series of our serial preferred stock, consisting of up to 402,500 authorized shares, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The holders of the Preferred Stock will have no preemptive
	rights. All of the shares of the Preferred Stock, when issued and paid for, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.


	The
	Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, (1) on a parity with (A) our 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
	of $0.01 and liquidation value per share of $1,000 (the Series A Preferred Stock), (B) our Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value of $0.01 and liquidation value per share of $1,000 (the
	Series B Preferred Stock), and (C) each class or series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to dividend
	rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution of Huntington (collectively, the parity securities) and (2) senior to our common stock and each other class or series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the
	terms of which do not expressly provide that it ranks on a parity with or senior to the Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of Huntington (collectively, the junior securities).
	Prior to the issuance of the Preferred Stock, 362,506 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and 35,500 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding. See Description of Huntington Capital StockPreferred Stock for a
	description of our authorized preferred shares.


	We will not be entitled to issue any class or series of our capital stock, the terms of
	which provide that such class or series will rank senior to the Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends or distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, without the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
	shares of our Preferred Stock then outstanding and any class or series of parity securities then outstanding, voting together as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference
	of the outstanding shares of such class or series. See Voting Rights.


	As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we
	are authorized to issue up to 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2015, 794,928,886 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.




	Dividends




	Under Maryland law, we
	may declare or pay dividends on the Preferred Stock only if, after payment of such dividends, we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business and only to the extent by which our total assets after payment
	of such dividends exceed the sum of our total liabilities. When the need to make these determinations arises, our board of directors will determine the amount of our total assets, total liabilities and preference amount in accordance with Maryland
	law.


	Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly in arrears, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors or a
	duly authorized committee of our board and declared by us out of legally available funds,

 
	


	S-16






	Table of Contents



	on a non-cumulative basis on the $1,000 per share liquidation preference, at an annual rate equal to 6.250%. Subject to the foregoing, dividends will be payable in arrears on
	January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year (each, a dividend payment date) commencing on July 15, 2016 or, if any such day is not a business day, the next business day. Each dividend will be
	payable to holders of record as they appear on our stock register on the first day of the month in which the relevant dividend payment date occurs. Each period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the following dividend
	payment date is herein referred to as a dividend period, except that the initial dividend period will commence on and include the date on which shares of the Preferred Stock are first issued to but excluding July 15, 2016. Dividends
	payable for each dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If a scheduled dividend payment date falls on a day that is not a business day, the dividend will be paid on the next business day
	as if it were paid on the scheduled dividend payment date, and no additional dividends will accrue in respect ofthe dividend so payable for the period from and after that dividend payment date to the date the dividend is paid.


	Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be non-cumulative. If for any reason our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board
	does not authorize and we do not declare cash dividends on the Preferred Stock for a dividend period, we will have no obligation to pay any dividends for that period, whether or not our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board
	authorizes and we declare dividends on the Preferred Stock for any subsequent dividend period.


	We are not obligated to and will not pay
	holders of the Preferred Stock any interest or sum of money in lieu of interest on any dividend not paid on a dividend payment date. We are also not obligated to and will not pay holders of the Preferred Stock any dividend in excess of the dividends
	on the Preferred Stock that are payable as described above.


	There is no sinking fund with respect to dividends.




	Dividend Stopper




	In addition, if
	full quarterly dividends on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for any dividend period have not been authorized, declared and paid or set aside for payment, we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends (other than a dividend
	payable solely in junior securities) with respect to, or redeeming, purchasing or acquiring any of, our junior securities during the next succeeding dividend period, other than:

 
	



 
	


	(i)


	redemptions, purchases or other acquisitions of junior securities in connection with any benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants
	or in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan;



 
	



 
	


	(ii)


	any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights
	pursuant thereto; and



 
	



 
	


	(iii)


	conversions into or exchanges for other junior securities and cash solely in lieu of fractional shares of the junior securities.




	If dividends for any dividend payment date are not paid in full on the shares of the Preferred Stock and there are issued and outstanding
	shares of parity securities for which such dividend payment date is also a scheduled dividend payment date, then all dividends declared on shares of the Preferred Stock and such parity securities on such date shall be declared pro rata so that the
	respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as full quarterly dividends per share on the shares of the Preferred Stock and all such parity securities otherwise payable on such date (subject to their having been
	authorized by the board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board and declared by us out of legally available funds and including, in the case of any such parity securities that bear cumulative dividends, all accumulated but unpaid
	dividends) bear to each other.

	Table of Contents





	Maturity




	The Preferred Stock does not have a maturity date, and we are not required to redeem the Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Preferred Stock and
	the related depositary shares will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless and until we decide to redeem it.




	Redemption




	The Preferred Stock will be redeemable, in whole or in part, from time to time, at our option on any dividend payment date on or after April
	15, 2021 at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Neither the holders of Preferred Stock nor holders of depositary shares will have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the
	Preferred Stock.




	Redemption upon a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event




	The Preferred Stock will be redeemable, in whole but not in part, within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event at a redemption
	price equal to the liquidation preference, plus any declared and unpaid dividends from the prior dividend period and the pro rated portion of dividends, whether or not declared, for the dividend period in which such redemption occurs. A
	regulatory capital treatment event means our good faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that
	is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of Preferred Stock; or (iii) any
	official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of Preferred Stock, there is
	more than an insubstantial risk that Huntington will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation value of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as Tier 1 Capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy
	guidelines of Federal Reserve Regulation Y, 12 C.F.R. 225 (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of
	Preferred Stock is outstanding.


	The Preferred Stock will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation to redeem, repurchase or
	retire the Preferred Stock.




	Redemption Procedures




	If shares of the Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of the
	Preferred Stock to be redeemed at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption (provided that, if the depositary shares are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (DTC) we may give
	such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth:

 
	



 
	


	(a)


	the redemption date;



 
	



 
	


	(b)


	the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares of a holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed;



 
	



 
	


	(c)


	the redemption price;



 
	



 
	


	(d)


	the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and



 
	



 
	


	(e)


	that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.




	If
	notice of redemption of any shares of the Preferred Stock has been duly given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by us for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, on
	and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of the

 
	


	S-18






	Table of Contents



	Preferred Stock, such shares of the Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption
	price plus any declared and unpaid dividends and, in the case of a redemption following a regulatory capital treatment event, the pro rated portion of dividends, whether or not declared, for the dividend period in which such redemption occurs. See
	Description of the Depositary Shares below for information about redemption of the depositary shares relating to the Preferred Stock.


	In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be
	selected either pro rata, by lot or in such other manner as we may determine to be equitable and permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Preferred Stock or related depositary shares are listed. Subject to the provisions hereof, our
	board of directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of the Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.


	Under the Federal Reserves current risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Preferred
	Stock is subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve. See Risk FactorsInvestors should not expect us to redeem the Preferred Stock on the date it becomes redeemable or on any particular date after it becomes redeemable in this
	prospectus supplement. Any redemption of the Preferred Stock is subject to our receipt of any required prior approval by the Federal Reserve (including any successor bank regulatory authority that may become our appropriate federal banking agency)
	and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve (or another successor bank regulatory authority that may become our appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to redemption of
	the Preferred Stock.


	Any notice of redemption, once given, shall be irrevocable.


	Neither the holders of the Preferred Stock nor the holders of the related depositary shares have the right to require the redemption or
	repurchase of the Preferred Stock.




	Liquidation Rights




	In the event that we voluntarily or involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of the Preferred Stock at the time outstanding
	will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in the amount of $1,000 per share of the Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus an amount equal to any authorized and declared but unpaid dividends thereon to and
	including the date of such liquidation, out of assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, before any distribution of assets is made to the holders of our common stock or any other junior securities. After payment of the full
	amount of such liquidating distributions, the holders of the Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by us, and will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets.


	In the event that our assets available for distribution to stockholders upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs,
	whether voluntary or involuntary, are insufficient to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on any parity securities, the holders of the Preferred Stock
	and the holders of such other parity securities will share ratably in any distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.


	For such purposes, our consolidation or merger with or into any other entity, the consolidation or merger of any other entity with or into us,
	or the sale of all or substantially all of our property or business, will not be deemed to constitute our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up.




	Voting Rights




	Except as indicated
	below, the holders of the Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights.

 
	


	S-19






	Table of Contents




	Right to Elect Two Directors upon Non-Payment of Dividends

	. If and when the dividends on
	the Preferred Stock or on any other class or series of our parity securities that has voting rights equivalent to those of the Preferred Stock, have not been authorized, declared and paid (i) in the case of the Preferred Stock and parity
	securities bearing non-cumulative dividends, in full for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), or (ii) in the case of parity securities bearing cumulative dividends, in an aggregate amount
	equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will be automatically increased by two. Holders of the
	Preferred Stock and the holders of all other classes and series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote for the election of the two additional directors, voting
	together as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such class or series, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of our board
	of directors (the Preferred Stock Directors) at any annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected or any special meeting of the holders of the Preferred Stock and any parity securities for which dividends
	have not been paid, called as provided below, but only if the election of any Preferred Stock Directors would not cause us to violate the corporate governance requirement of the NASDAQ (or any other exchange on which our securities may be listed)
	that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. In addition, our board of directors shall at no time have more than two Preferred Stock Directors.


	At any time after this voting power has vested as described above, our Secretary may, and upon the written request of holders of record of at
	least 20% of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock and such parity securities (addressed to the Secretary at our principal office) must, call a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock and such parity securities for the election of
	the Preferred Stock Directors. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in our bylaws for a special meeting of the stockholders, which we will provide upon request, or as required by law. If our Secretary is
	required to call a meeting but does not do so within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of the Preferred Stock may (at our expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this section, and for that purpose
	will have access to our stock books. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders unless they have been previously terminated as described below. In case any
	vacancy occurs among the Preferred Stock Directors, a successor will be elected by our board of directors to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders upon the nomination by the remaining Preferred Stock Director or if none remains in
	office, by the vote of the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and all parity securities, voting as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference
	of the outstanding shares of such class or series. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.


	Whenever full dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on the Preferred Stock and any non-cumulative parity securities for at least
	four consecutive dividend periods and all dividends on any cumulative parity securities have been paid in full, then the right of the holders of the Preferred Stock and any parity security to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but
	subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of these voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods), the terms of office of all Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate
	and the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be automatically reduced accordingly.




	Other Voting Rights




	So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by our charter,
	the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock and any class or series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and are then outstanding,
	voting together as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such

	Certain Charter Amendments

	. Any amendment of our charter to authorize, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Preferred Stock with respect to
	payment of dividends or distribution of assets on our liquidation, as well as any amendment of our charter that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely;

	provided

	that the amendment of the charter so as to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized amount of any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of our stock ranking on a
	parity with or junior to the Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and in the distribution of assets on our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up shall not be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the
	Preferred Stock; or



 
	



 
	


	

 
	



	Certain Mergers and Consolidations

	. Any merger or consolidation of us with or into any entity other than a corporation (or comparable foreign entity), or any merger or consolidation of us with or into any
	corporation (or comparable foreign entity) unless (i) we are the surviving corporation in such merger or consolidation and the Preferred Stock remains outstanding or (ii) we are not the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation but
	the Preferred Stock is not changed in such merger or consolidation into anything other than a class or series of preferred stock or similar security of the surviving or resulting entity, or the entity controlling such entity, having voting powers,
	preferences and special rights that, if such change were effected by amendment of our charter, would not require a vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock under the preceding paragraph.




	The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which the vote would otherwise be
	required, all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by us for the benefit of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock to effect
	the redemption.


	The holders of Preferred Stock shall have exclusive voting rights on any charter amendment that would alter only the
	contract rights, as expressly set forth in our charter, of the Preferred Stock.




	Depositary




	Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Computershare Inc. will be the depositary for the depositary shares.







	Transfer Agent, Registrar, and Paying Agent




	Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will act as initial transfer agent, registrar and paying agent for the payment of dividends for the Preferred
	Stock.




	Title




	We and the
	transfer agent, registrar and paying agent may treat the registered holder of the Preferred Stock as the absolute owner of the Preferred Stock for the purpose of making payment and for all other purposes.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES





	General




	We are issuing depositary
	shares representing proportional fractional interests in shares of the Preferred Stock. Each depositary share represents a 1/40th interest in a share of our Preferred Stock, and will be evidenced by depositary receipts. We will deposit the
	underlying shares of the Preferred Stock with a depositary pursuant to a deposit agreement among us, Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., jointly acting as depositary. The holders of depositary shares from time to time shall be
	deemed to be parties to the deposit agreement and shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions thereto by their acceptance of delivery of the depositary shares to the same extent as though they had executed the deposit agreement. Subject to the
	terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of the depositary shares will be entitled, through the depositary, to all the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock, as applicable, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Preferred
	Stock those depositary shares represent.


	In this prospectus supplement, references to holders of depositary shares mean those
	who own depositary shares registered in their own names on the books maintained by the depositary and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in the street name, or issued in book-entry form through DTC. You
	should review the special considerations that apply to indirect holders described in this Book-Entry Issuance.


	Immediately
	following the issuance of the Preferred Stock, we will deposit the Preferred Stock with the depositary, which will then issue the depositary shares to the underwriters. Copies of the forms of deposit agreement and the depositary receipt may be
	obtained from us upon request and in the manner described in the Where You Can Find More Information section of this prospectus supplement.




	Dividends and Other Distributions




	Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/40th of the dividend declared and payable on the related share of
	the Preferred Stock.


	The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited
	Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. If we make a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute
	any securities or property received by it to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that (after consultation with us)
	it is not feasible to make a distribution, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems equitable and practicable, including the sale of the securities or property and distribute the net proceeds
	from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold.


	Record dates for the
	payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Preferred Stock.

 
	


	The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on
	account of taxes or other governmental charges. The depositary may refuse to make any payment or distribution, or any transfer, exchange, or withdrawal of any depositary shares or the shares of the Preferred Stock until such taxes or other
	governmental charges are paid.




	Redemption of Depositary Shares




	If we redeem the Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, in whole or in part, as described above under Description of the
	Preferred StockRedemption and Description of the Preferred StockRedemption upon a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the depositary shares will be redeemed with the

 
	


	S-22






	Table of Contents



	proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to 1/40th of the
	redemption price per share payable with respect to the Preferred Stock (or $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, except in the case of a redemption pursuant to a regulatory
	capital treatment event.


	Whenever we redeem shares of the Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the
	same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Preferred Stock so redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding depositary shares are redeemed, the depositary will select the shares to be redeemed pro rata or
	by lot. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares.




	Voting the Preferred Stock




	Because each depositary share represents a 1/40th interest in a share of the Preferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled
	to 1/40th of a vote per depositary share under those limited circumstances in which holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote, as described above in Description of the Preferred StockVoting Rights.


	When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail
	the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Preferred
	Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Preferred Stock represented by the holders depositary shares. Insofar as practicable, the depositary will vote the amount of the Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in
	accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the
	holders of any depositary shares representing proportional interests in the Preferred Stock, it will not vote the amount of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares.




	Form and Notices




	The Preferred
	Stock will be issued in registered form to the depositary, and the depositary shares will be issued in book-entry form through DTC, as described below in Book-Entry Issuance. The depositary will forward to the holders of depositary
	shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are delivered to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the Preferred Stock.




	Preemptive and Conversion Rights




	The holders of the depositary shares and the Preferred Stock do not have any preemptive or conversion rights.




	Listing




	We intend to apply to
	list the depositary shares on the NASDAQ under the symbol HBANO. If the application is approved, trading of the depositary shares on the NASDAQ is expected to commence within 30 days after they are first issued.




	Depositary, Dividend Disbursing Agent, Registrar and Redemption Agent




	Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will be the depositary, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will be the dividend
	disbursing agent, registrar and redemption agent for the depositary shares.

	Huntington is authorized to issue a total of 1,506,617,808 shares of all classes of stock. Of the total number of authorized shares of stock,
	1,500,000,000 shares are common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 6,617,808 shares are serial preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. A statement of the designations of the authorized classes of preferred stock or of any series thereof, and
	the powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of that stock, or of the authority of Huntingtons board of directors to authorize those designations and
	other terms, is as follows.


	The following description of the terms of our stock is only a summary. For a complete description, we refer
	you to the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter and our bylaws.




	Preferred Stock




	Shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Huntingtons board of directors is authorized, within the
	limitations and restrictions stated in article fifth of Huntingtons charter, to establish the serial designations of the preferred stock and any such series of preferred stock, which (a) may have such voting powers full or limited, or may
	be without voting powers; (b) may be subject to redemption at such time or times and at such prices; (c) may be entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or noncumulative) at such rate or rates, on such conditions, and at such
	times and payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or series of stock; (d) may have such rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, Huntington;
	(e) may be made convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of Huntington, at such price or prices or at such rates of exchange, and with
	such adjustments; and (f) shall have such other preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, terms or conditions of redemption or other rights, all as are authorized by the
	board of directors and stated and expressed in the articles supplementary or other charter document providing for the issuance of such serial preferred stock.



	Series A Preferred Stock

	. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon
	liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, (1) on a parity with (A) our Series B Preferred Stock, (B) the Preferred Stock, and (C) each class or series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the terms of which expressly
	provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on our liquidation, winding up and dissolution of Huntington and (2) senior to our common stock and each other class or
	series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the terms of which do not expressly provide that it ranks on a parity with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on our liquidation, winding-up and
	dissolution.




	Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 83.6680
	shares of our common stock (which reflects an approximate initial conversion price of $11.95 per share of common stock) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. On or after April 15, 2013, we may, at our
	option, at any time or from time to time cause some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of our common stock at the then applicable conversion rate. We may exercise our conversion right if, for 20 trading days within
	any period of 30 consecutive trading days, including the last trading day of such period, ending on the trading day preceding the date we give notice of mandatory conversion, the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the then applicable
	conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock.


	Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears, when, as
	and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of legally available funds, on a non-cumulative basis on the $1,000 per share liquidation preference, at an annual rate equal to 8.50%.

	Stock bearing cumulative dividends, in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, together with the holders
	of all other affected classes and series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of
	the outstanding shares of such class or series, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of our board of directors;

	outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and any class or series of preferred stock then outstanding that ranks on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock and has similar rights (which includes the Preferred Stock), voting together as a
	single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such class or series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at
	any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating certain charter amendments and certain mergers and consolidations.





	Series B Preferred Stock

	. The Series B Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon
	liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, (1) on a parity with (A) our Series A Preferred Stock, (B) the Preferred Stock, and (C) each class or series of preferred stock we may issue in the future the terms of which expressly
	provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on our liquidation, winding up and dissolution and (2) senior to our common stock and each other class or series of
	preferred stock we may issue in the future the terms of which do not expressly provide that it ranks on a parity with or senior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on our liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of
	Huntington.




	The Series B Preferred Stock does not entitle the holder to any preemptive or conversion rights.


	Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable when, as and if authorized by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of
	our board and declared by us out of legally available funds, on a non-cumulative basis on the $1,000 per share liquidation preference, at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.70% per annum payable quarterly, in arrears.


	The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable, in whole or in part, from time to time, at our option on any dividend payment date on or

	If and when the dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock or on any other class or series of our preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock that has voting rights equivalent to those of the
	Series B Preferred Stock (which includes the Preferred Stock), have not been authorized, declared and paid (i) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock and any class or series of our preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series B
	Preferred Stock and bearing non-cumulative dividends, in full for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), or (ii) in the case of any class or series of our preferred stock ranking on a parity
	with the Series B Preferred Stock and bearing cumulative dividends, in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the holders of the Series B
	Preferred Stock, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate
	to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such class or series, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of our board of directors;



 
	



 
	


	

	Common
	Stock




	Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us
	out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends. They are also entitled to share ratably in our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or after payment
	of or adequate provision for all of our known debts and liabilities. These rights are subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our stock, including the Preferred Stock.


	Except as may otherwise be specified in the terms of any class or series of common stock, each outstanding share of common stock entitles the
	holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of our common stock will possess the exclusive voting
	power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining
	shares will not be able to elect any directors.


	Holders of our common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or
	redemption rights, have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities and generally have no appraisal rights except in certain limited transactions. All shares of common stock will have equal dividend, liquidation and other rights.
	Under Maryland law, our stockholders generally are not liable for our debts or obligations.


	Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation
	generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the

 
	


	S-26






	Table of Contents



	ordinary course of business, unless declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on
	the matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter does not provide for a
	lesser percentage in these situations.


	The transfer agent and registrar for the common stock is Computershare Investor Services, Inc.

	BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE



	DTC will act as securities depositary for all of the depositary shares. We will issue the depositary shares only as fully-registered
	securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTCs nominee). We will issue and deposit with DTC one or more fully-registered global certificates for the depositary shares representing, in the aggregate, the total number of the
	depositary shares to be sold in this offering.


	DTC has advised us that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York
	Banking Law, a banking organization under the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation under the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a clearing agency registered under the
	provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among participants of securities transactions, like transfers and pledges, in deposited securities
	through electronic computerized book-entry changes in the participants accounts, eliminating in this manner the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
	companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its direct participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Others, like securities brokers and dealers,
	banks and trust companies that clear through or maintain custodial relationships with direct participants, either directly or indirectly, are indirect participants and also have access to the DTC system. The rules applicable to DTC and its
	participants are on file with the SEC.


	Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional
	depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry transfers between their accounts. Clearstream provides its
	participants with, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic securities markets in several
	countries through established depository and custodial relationships. As a professional depositary, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector, also known as the Commission de
	Surveillance du Secteur Financier. Clearstream participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations.
	Clearstreams participants in the U.S. are limited to securities brokers and dealers and banks. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to other institutions such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
	maintain a custodial relationship with Clearstream participants. Distributions with respect to interests in global securities held through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of its customers in accordance with its rules and procedures, to
	the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream.


	Euroclear has advised us that it was created to hold securities for its
	participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of
	simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing, and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the
	Euroclear operator) under contract with Euroclear plc, a U.K. corporation. Euroclear participants include banks, including central banks, securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to
	Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.


	Purchases of depositary shares within the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants, who will receive a credit for the
	depositary shares on DTCs records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each depositary share is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants records. DTC will not send written confirmation to beneficial
	owners of their purchases, but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transactions, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from

 
	


	S-28






	Table of Contents



	the direct or indirect participants through which the beneficial owners purchased depositary shares. Transfers of ownership interests in the depositary shares are to be accomplished by entries
	made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in depositary shares, unless the book-entry system for the depositary shares is
	discontinued. Interests held through Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTCs books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear, which U.S. depositaries will in turn hold interests on behalf of their
	participants customers securities accounts.


	DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the depositary shares.
	DTCs records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts the depositary shares are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their
	holdings on behalf of their customers.


	Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by direct
	participants to indirect participants, and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners and the voting rights of direct participants, indirect participants and beneficial owners, subject to any statutory or regulatory
	requirements as is in effect from time to time, will be governed by arrangements among them.


	We will send redemption notices to
	Cede & Co. as the registered holder of the depositary shares. If less than all of these depositary shares are redeemed, DTCs current practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant to be redeemed.


	Although voting on the depositary shares is limited to the holders of record of the depositary shares, in those instances in which a vote
	is required, neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will itself consent or vote on depositary shares. Under its usual procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede &
	Co.s consenting or voting rights to direct participants for whose accounts the depositary shares are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy).


	We will make distribution payments on the depositary shares to DTC. DTCs practice is to credit direct participants accounts on the
	relevant payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTCs records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payments on the payment date. Standing instructions and customary practices will govern payments
	from participants to beneficial owners. Subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements, participants, and neither DTC nor we, will be responsible for the payment. We and any paying agent will be responsible for payment of distributions to DTC.
	Direct and indirect participants are responsible for the disbursement of the payments to the beneficial owners.


	DTC may discontinue
	providing its services as securities depositary on any of the depositary shares at any time by giving reasonable notice to us. If a successor securities depositary is not obtained, final depositary shares certificates must be printed and delivered.
	We may at our option decide to discontinue the use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor depositary). In this case, final certificates for the depositary shares will be printed and delivered.


	We have obtained the information in this section about DTC and DTCs book-entry system from sources that we believe to be accurate, but
	we assume no responsibility for the accuracy of the information. We have no responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants of their respective obligations as described in this prospectus supplement or under the rules and procedures
	governing their respective operations.

	CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS




	General



	The following is
	a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the depositary shares. The following summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
	Code), U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and other applicable authorities, each as
	in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth
	herein.


	This summary is for general information only and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be
	relevant to a particular investor in light of that investors individual circumstances, nor does it address the effects of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, any tax treaty or any U.S. federal estate, gift, generation-skipping transfer or
	alternative minimum tax considerations. This summary is limited to taxpayers who will hold the depositary shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, and it does not purport to be applicable to special
	classes of investors including, but not limited to, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, banks or other financial institutions, grantor trusts, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	(and investors therein), subchapter S corporations, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred accounts, controlled foreign corporations, dealers in securities or currencies, regulated investment companies, real estate
	investment trusts, passive foreign investment companies for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates, persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, traders in securities that
	elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, and persons that will hold the depositary shares as a position in a hedging transaction, straddle, conversion, wash sale,
	constructive sale, integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other risk reduction transaction. This summary does not address the tax considerations that may be relevant to subsequent purchasers of the
	depositary shares and does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 nor any considerations with respect to any withholding
	required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered in connection therewith).


	If a partnership (or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the depositary shares, the tax
	treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner and the partnership holding the depositary shares should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax considerations of
	acquiring, holding and disposing of the depositary shares.


	We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to
	the statements made and the conclusions reached in this discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.


	The remainder of this discussion assumes that beneficial owners of the depositary shares will be treated as owners of the underlying Preferred
	Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.




	U.S. Holders




	As used in this discussion, the term U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of the depositary shares that is, for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes:

 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	an individual citizen or resident of the United States;



 
	


	S-31






	Table of Contents




 
	


	

 
	


	a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof or the District of Columbia (and certain
	non-U.S. entities taxed as U.S. corporations under specialized sections of the Code);



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it
	has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.





	Distributions

	. Distributions with respect to the depositary shares will be taxable as dividend income to the extent paid out of our
	current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that the amount of a distribution with respect to the depositary shares exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such
	distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in such depositary shares, and thereafter as capital gain.


	Distributions with respect to the depositary shares taxable as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes paid to a corporate U.S. holder
	will generally qualify for a 70% dividends-received deduction. However, a corporate U.S. holder may not be entitled to take the 70% dividends-received deduction in all circumstances, and, even if it is so entitled, may be subject to special rules in
	respect of its ownership of the depositary shares. Corporate U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the holding period and other requirements that must be satisfied in order to qualify for the dividends-received deduction and with
	respect to the possible application of the extraordinary dividend provisions of the federal income tax law to their ownership or disposition of the depositary shares in their particular circumstances.


	Distributions with respect to the depositary shares taxable as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes paid to a noncorporate U.S.
	holder will generally represent qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is taxable at preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that certain holding period requirements are met and certain other
	conditions are satisfied.



	Sale, Exchange, or Certain Other Taxable Dispositions of the Depositary Shares

	. A U.S. holder will
	generally recognize capital gain or loss on a sale or exchange or other taxable disposition (other than certain redemptions described under U.S. HoldersRedemptions of the Depositary Shares) of the depositary shares equal to the
	difference, if any, between the amount realized upon the sale or exchange and such U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in the depositary shares sold or exchanged. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
	holders holding period for the depositary shares sold or exchanged is more than one year. Long-term capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers are generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
	limitations.



	Redemptions of the Depositary Shares

	. The tax treatment accorded to any redemption by us of our depositary shares
	from a U.S. holder can only be determined on the basis of the particular facts as to each U.S. holder of our depositary shares at the time of redemption.


	In general, a U.S. holder of our depositary shares will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount received
	by the U.S. holder of such depositary shares upon the redemption and such U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in the depositary shares redeemed if such redemption is considered to:

 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	result in a complete termination of the U.S. holders stock interest in us;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	be substantially disproportionate with respect to the U.S. holder;



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	be not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the U.S. holder; or



 
	


	S-32






	Table of Contents




 
	


	

 
	


	be a redemption of stock held by a shareholder who is not a corporation and where such redemption results in a partial liquidation of us.




	In applying these tests, there must be taken into account not only the depositary shares being redeemed, but also such U.S. holders
	ownership of other classes and series of our capital stock and any options (including stock purchase rights) to acquire any of the foregoing. A U.S. holder of our depositary shares also must take into account any such securities (including options)
	which are considered to be owned by such U.S. holder by reason of the constructive ownership rules set forth in Section 318 of the Code.


	If the redemption does not meet any of the tests described above, then the redemption proceeds received from our depositary shares will be
	treated as a distribution on our shares and will be taxable as described under the caption U.S. HoldersDistributions above. If a redemption of the depositary shares is treated as a distribution that is taxable as a dividend, U.S.
	holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the allocation of their tax basis in the redeemed and remaining depositary shares.



	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

	. Information returns will generally be filed with the IRS in connection with the payment
	of dividends or other taxable distributions on the depositary shares to noncorporate U.S. holders and certain payments of proceeds to U.S. holders on the sale, exchange or redemption of the depositary shares. Additionally, such payments may be
	subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) unless such U.S. holder (a) comes within certain exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact in the manner required, or (b) within a reasonable period of time, provides a
	correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.


	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. holder is
	allowable as a credit against such holders U.S. federal income tax, which may entitle the U.S. holder to a refund, provided that the U.S. holder provides the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.




	Non-U.S. Holders




	As used in this
	discussion, the term non-U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of the depositary shares other than a U.S. holder as defined above or an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



	Dividends

	. Distributions with respect to the depositary shares taxable as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes paid to a
	non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless such dividends are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
	business of the non-U.S. holder within the United States and, where an applicable tax treaty so provides, are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment. In order to claim the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, a non-U.S. holder
	generally must furnish us or other payor with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) before the distribution date. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their entitlement to
	benefits under an applicable income tax treaty and the requirements for claiming any such benefits.


	Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder
	that are effectively connected with such non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment of the non-U.S. holder in the United
	States) generally are not subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that the non-U.S. holder furnishes us or other payor with a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI before the distribution date. Instead, such dividends generally will be subject
	to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. person. Any such effectively connected dividends received by a foreign corporation

 
	


	S-33






	Table of Contents



	may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty, subject to certain adjustments.


	A non-U.S. holder eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty may obtain a refund of
	any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.



	Sale, Exchange, or Certain Other Taxable
	Dispositions of the Depositary Shares

	. Subject to the discussion below under Information Reporting and Backup Withholding on Non-U.S. Holders, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or
	withholding on gain realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the depositary shares so long as:

 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	the gain is not effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and if required by an applicable tax treaty, the gain is not attributable to a permanent
	establishment maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States);



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	in the case of a nonresident alien individual, such non-U.S. holder is not present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the sale or disposition (and certain other conditions are met); and



 
	



 
	


	

 
	


	the depositary shares do not constitute U.S. real property interests in a U.S. real property holding corporation (a USRPHC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of
	the five-year period preceding the disposition or the period that the non-U.S. holder held the depositary shares. We do not believe that we currently are a USRPHC or that we will become one in the future.




	Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S.
	federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. person. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may, under certain circumstances be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as
	specified by an applicable income tax treaty of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.


	Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the disposition (or such lower rate
	as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses, if any, for the taxable year, provided that the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.


	As discussed above under U.S. HoldersRedemption of the Depositary Shares, an amount paid to a holder of depositary
	shares in connection with a redemption of the depositary shares may, under certain circumstances, be treated as a dividend. In that case, the payment would be subject to the rules for dividends described above under Non-U.S.
	HoldersDividends.



	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

	. Payment of dividends and the tax withheld with respect
	thereto are subject to information reporting requirements. These information reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty or withholding was not required because the
	dividends were effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States conducted by the non-U.S. holder. Copies of the information returns reporting such dividends and withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the
	country in which the non-U.S. holder resides.


	U.S. backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) will generally apply on payment of
	dividends to a non-U.S. holder unless such non-U.S. holder furnishes to the payor a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or

	W-8BEN-E

	(or other applicable IRS Form W-8) or otherwise establishes an exemption.


	Payment by a U.S. office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of the depositary shares by a non-U.S. holder is subject to both backup
	withholding and information reporting unless the non-U.S. holder provides a properly

 
	


	S-34






	Table of Contents



	executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) certifying its non-U.S. status or otherwise establishes an exemption. The payment of proceeds from the disposition of
	depositary shares by a non-U.S. holder effected at a non-U.S. office of a U.S. broker or a non-U.S. broker with certain specified U.S. connections generally will be subject to information reporting (but not backup withholding) unless the non-U.S.
	holder provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) certifying the non-U.S. holders non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Backup withholding will apply if the sale is subject
	to information reporting and the broker has actual knowledge that the recipient a U.S. person.


	Backup withholding is not an additional
	tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to a non-U.S. holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against that holders U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the
	holder furnishes the required information to the IRS. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their particular circumstances.

	CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS



	The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), imposes certain requirements on employee benefit plans
	subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans (ERISA Plans), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISAs
	general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plans investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan.


	Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well
	as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts or an entity deemed to hold the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, Plans)) and
	certain persons (referred to as parties in interest or disqualified persons) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or
	disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.


	Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the depositary shares should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability
	of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any
	other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or the Code.


	Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32)
	of ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may
	nevertheless be subject to other federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (Similar Law). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their
	counsel before purchasing the depositary shares to determine the need for and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.



	Each purchaser of the deposit


	a


	ry shares will be deemed to have represented and agreed that (i) either (A) it is not and is
	not acting on behalf of a (1) Plan or (2) a non-U.S., governmental or church plan subject to Similar Laws; or


	(B) its purchase of the deposita


	ry shares is not a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code and is otherwise
	permissible under all applicable Similar Laws; and (ii) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the deposit


	a


	ry shares or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations,
	warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase of such deposit


	a


	ry shares.

	The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of
	the depositary shares offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel
	or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the depositary shares offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus if any shares are taken.
	If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated.


	We have agreed for a period from the date of this prospectus supplement through, and including, the date 30 days after the date hereof that we
	will not, without the prior written consent of the representatives, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise
	transfer or dispose of any of our securities that are substantially similar to the Preferred Stock or the depositary shares, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent rights to receive, Preferred
	Stock, depositary shares or substantially similar securities. This limitation does not apply to the securities to be issued in exchange for securities of FirstMerit.


	The underwriters propose to offer some of the depositary shares directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover
	page of this prospectus supplement and may offer some of the depositary shares to dealers at the public offering price less a concession not to exceed $0.50 per depositary share sold to retail investors and $0.15 per depositary share sold to
	institutional investors. The underwriters may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a concession not in excess of $0.45 per depositary share sold to retail investors. After the initial offering of the depositary shares to the public, the
	representatives may change the public offering price, concession and discount.


	We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable
	for 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,100,000 additional depositary shares at the public offering price

 
	


	S-37






	Table of Contents



	listed on the cover of this prospectus supplement, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option; to the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter
	will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase approximately the same percentage of the additional depositary shares as the number listed next to the underwriters name in the preceding table bears to the total number of
	depositary shares listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table.


	The following table shows the underwriting
	discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional depositary shares:

	Reflects 503,000 depositary shares sold to institutional investors, for which the underwriters received an underwriting discount of $0.2500 per share, and 13,497,000 depositary shares sold to retail investors, for which
	the underwriters received an underwriting discount of $0.7875 per share.




	The expenses of this offering, not including the
	underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $1,285,181 (assuming the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional depositary shares) and are payable by us.


	Certain directors and employees of Huntington may purchase depositary shares in this offering.


	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the depositary shares. We do not expect that there will be any separate public
	trading market for the shares of the Preferred Stock except as represented by the depositary shares. We intend to apply to list the depositary shares on NASDAQ under the symbol HBANO. If the application is approved, we expect trading of
	the depositary shares on NASDAQ to begin within the 30-day period after the initial delivery of the depositary shares.


	To facilitate the
	offering of the depositary shares, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the depositary shares. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more depositary shares than they are obligated to
	purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short position may involve either covered short sales or naked short sales. Covered short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the
	underwriters option to purchase additional depositary shares as described above. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option or purchasing depositary shares in the open market. In determining the
	source of shares to close the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of depositary shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase depositary shares
	from us through the option. Naked short sales are sales in excess of the option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing depositary shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
	underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the depositary shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. As an additional means of facilitating the
	offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, depositary shares in the open market to stabilize the price of the depositary shares. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the depositary shares above independent market
	levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the depositary shares. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities, and may end any of these activities at any time.


	The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the
	underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased depositary shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.


	In general, purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilizing or reducing a syndicate short position could cause the price of the
	security to be higher than it might otherwise be in the absence of such purchases.

	Neither we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
	magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the depositary shares. In addition, neither we nor the underwriters make any representation that the underwriters will engage in such transactions or that such
	transactions will not be discontinued without notice, once they are commenced.


	In connection with the offering, certain of the
	underwriters or securities dealers may distribute prospectus supplements by electronic means, such as email.


	We have agreed to indemnify
	the several underwriters and their controlling persons against certain liabilities in connection with this offering, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in
	respect of those liabilities.


	The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
	activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and
	their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to us and to persons and entities with relationships with us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.


	In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and
	employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their
	customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of us (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with us. If
	any of the underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those underwriters or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those underwriters may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their
	customary risk management policies.


	Typically, these underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
	transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the securities offered hereby. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also
	communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend.


	The underwriters expect to deliver the depositary shares to purchasers on or about March 21, 2016, which will be the fifth business day
	following the pricing of the depositary shares (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as T + 5). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days,
	unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade depositary shares on the date of pricing or the next business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the depositary shares initially
	will settle T + 5, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the depositary shares who wish to trade the depositary shares on the date of pricing of the depositary shares or
	the next business day should consult their own adviser.



	Conflicts of Interest



	Our affiliate, The Huntington Investment Company, is a member of FINRA and is participating in the distribution of the depositary shares. The
	distribution arrangements for this offering comply with the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121, regarding a FINRA member firms participation in the distribution of securities of an affiliate. In accordance with that rule, no FINRA member firm
	that has a conflict of interest, as defined therein, may make sales in this offering to any discretionary account without the prior approval of the customer.

	net proceeds to us. Any underwriters, dealers, or agents participating in the offering may be deemed underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act).

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	This prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement contain or incorporate by reference forward-looking statements about the
	Issuer that are intended to be subject to the safe harbors created under U.S. federal securities laws. The use of words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, plans and
	believes, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements; however, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate
	strictly to historical or current facts.




	By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions,
	risks, and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, those which may be set
	forth in the accompanying prospectus supplement and those under the heading Risk Factors included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and other factors described in our periodic reports filed from time to time with the SEC. Actual
	results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, those discussed under Risk Factors in the applicable prospectus
	supplement and in other information contained in our publicly available filings with the SEC. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on us and our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	We encourage you to understand forward-looking statements to be strategic objectives rather than absolute forecasts of future
	performance. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. We are not under any obligation to, or intend to,
	publicly update or review any of these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those
	forward-looking statements will not be realized. Please carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in the applicable prospectus supplement and in our other reports filed with the SEC that attempt to advise interested parties of the
	risks and factors that may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

	USE OF PROCEEDS





	Unless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, we anticipate using the net proceeds from the sale of the securities by the

	During the first quarter of 2009, Huntington experienced a sustained decline in its stock price, which was primarily attributable to the continuing
	economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial institutions credit risks and capital positions as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and intervention. Huntington determined that these changes
	would more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts. Therefore, Huntington performed a goodwill impairment test, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion in the first quarter
	of 2009.
