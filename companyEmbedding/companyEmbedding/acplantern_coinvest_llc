About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.

More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

 Terms of Use 
These Terms of Use were last modified in September 2016.
 Terms of Use and your acceptance of them. Read before continuing. 
FMR LLC is pleased to provide you with the information, content, tools, products and services on all Fidelity Sites (the term "Fidelity Sites" refers to all Fidelity web sites, as well as to the content on them). Because these Terms of Use cover multiple web sites, some terms may refer to items that are available only on certain Fidelity sites. These Terms of Use also include some important disclosures and information related to certain products and services. Your use of Fidelity Sites is subject to these Terms of Use ("Terms"). There are many different Fidelity companies ("Fidelity Entities"), and their affiliates, that provide information, content, tools, products and services on and through the Fidelity Sites. These Fidelity Entities are identified below and in each part of the Fidelity Sites where they provide such information, content and services.
These Terms are a binding agreement between you and the Fidelity Entities listed below, as well as their U.S. affiliates ("Fidelity").

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services. A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.
The following investments and brokerage products and services are offered through Fidelity Sites by the Fidelity Entity indicated. These four Fidelity Entities are also broker-dealers:

 Professionally managed accounts 
Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®, Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service at Work, BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio and Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines are services offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments Company. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through the following Fidelity Investments companies: Strategic Advisers, Inc., Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB ("FPTC"), a federal savings bank, or Fidelity Management Trust Company ("FMTC"). Non-deposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and FMTC and their affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.
Persons outside of the United States should visit Fidelity Institutional, which will direct them to the appropriate overseas web site of Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates. Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates, Fidelity Worldwide Investments (FIL Limited), Fidelity Investments Canada Limited, Fidelity Investments Management (H.K.) Limited, Fidelity Investments Japan, and Fidelity Brokerage Services Japan LLC offer products and services designed specifically for overseas investors.
 
 Broker-dealer's potential conflicts 
As a broker-dealer, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC or its affiliates may act as principal for its own account or as agent for its customers in connection with the sale to you or purchase by you of a security that is the subject of content prepared by Fidelity. If it receives a mark-up or commission or acts as agent for another person in connection with any such transaction, Fidelity may have a potential conflict of interest. You understand this potential conflict and acknowledge that you may choose to effect securities transactions at another broker-dealer.
 
 Limitations on investment guidance and professional advice 
The Fidelity Sites are not intended to provide legal, tax, investment or insurance advice. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Fidelity or any third party. Certain investment planning tools available on the Fidelity Sites may provide general investment education based on your input. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

ANY NON-U.S. OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE

AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, COPIES OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED

(b)                                   
If any Company Securities cease to
be subject to any and all restrictions on Transfer set forth in
this Agreement, the Company, upon the written request of the holder
thereof, shall issue to such holder a new certificate evidencing
such Company Securities without the second sentence of the legend
required by Section 3.02(a) endorsed thereon.

 

Section 3.03.
                            
Restrictions on Transfers by
Employee Shareholders .  (a) Subject to
Section 3.03(c), no Employee Shareholder shall Transfer any of
its Company Securities except as follows:
 
9 






 

(i)                                     
in a Transfer made to one or more of
its Permitted Transferees;

 

(ii)                                  
in a Transfer made in compliance
with Section 3.03(b);

 

(iii)                               
in a Transfer made in compliance
with Section 4.01; or

 

(iv)                              
with the prior written consent of
the Company and the Avista Entities;

 
provided , however , each Transfer in accordance
with clauses (i) through (iii) above shall require
(x) the applicable transferee to have executed and delivered
to the Company a Joinder Agreement agreeing to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement as an Employee Shareholder in accordance
with Section 6.02 and (y) the transferring Employee
Shareholder to have given prior written notice to the Company of
the proposed Transfer to its Permitted Transferee, including the
identity of such proposed Permitted Transferee and such other
information reasonably requested by the Company to ensure
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
 

(b)                                 
Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and whether the Company has filed a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
similar form) or authorized, approved or permitted the
implementation of a Rule 10b-5(1) sales plan:

 

(i)                                    
following the First Public Offering,
subject to Section 3.01(a), in addition to Transfers to
Permitted Transferees, each Employee Shareholder may Transfer
shares of Common Stock, other than any unvested shares of Common
Stock and/or Common Stock Options issued or granted pursuant to
employee benefit plans (such shares of Common Stock that may be
Transferred, “ Unrestricted Securities ”), but
only to the extent such Transfer would not result in the Relative
Ownership Percentage (as defined below) of the Unrestricted
Securities owned by such Employee Shareholder immediately following
the effective time of such Transfer (the “ Determination
Time ”) being less than the aggregate Relative Ownership
Percentage of the Company Securities owned by the Avista Entities
immediately following the Determination Time.  For purposes of
this Section 3.03(b)(i), “ Relative Ownership
Percentage ” means:

 

(x)                                   
with respect to the Unrestricted
Securities held by an Employee Shareholder, a fraction (expressed
as a percentage), (A) the numerator of which is the number of
Unrestricted Securities owned by such Employee Shareholder
immediately following the Determination Time and (B) the
denominator of which is the sum of (1) the number of
Unrestricted Securities owned by such Employee Shareholder
immediately following the
 
10 





 

First Public Offering and
(2) the number of Company Securities owned by such Employee
Shareholder that were not Unrestricted Securities immediately
following the First Public Offering but that have subsequently
become Unrestricted Securities, and

 

(y)                                 
with respect to Company Securities
owned by the Avista Entities, a fraction (expressed as a
percentage), (A) the numerator of which is the aggregate
number of Company Securities owned by the Avista Entities
immediately following the Determination Time and (B) the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Company Securities
owned by the Avista Entities immediately following the First Public
Offering.

 

(ii)                                 
Following the First Public Offering,
if any Avista Entity Transfers Company Securities to a Third Party,
it shall notify the Company following the consummation of such
Transfer of the number and type of Company Securities Transferred
and the Company shall reasonably promptly notify each Employee
Shareholder and each Permitted Transferee of such
information.  Any Employee Shareholder wishing to Transfer
Company Securities pursuant to Section 3.03(b)(i) shall
be entitled to obtain prior to such Transfer, and rely upon, a
statement from the Company of the number of Unrestricted Securities
that such Employee Shareholder may Transfer pursuant to
Section 3.03(b)(i).

 

(c)                                  
The restrictions on Transfers set
forth in Section 3.03(a) shall terminate on the date on
which the percentage determined by dividing the Aggregate Ownership
of Company Securities for the Avista Entities on such date by their
Initial Ownership of Company Securities falls below 10%.
 
ARTICLE 4
DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS; PUT RIGHT AND CALL
RIGHT
 

Section 4.01.
                            
Drag-Along Rights
.  (a)  Subject to this
Section 4.01 and Section 4.02, if the Avista Entities
(together, the “ Drag-Along Seller ”) propose to
Transfer not less than 50% of their collective Aggregate Ownership
of any class of Company Securities to a Third Party (the “
Drag-Along Transferee ”) in a bona fide sale (a
“ Drag-Along Sale ”), the Drag-Along Seller may
at its option require all Employee Shareholders (i) to
Transfer the Drag-Along Portion of such class of Company Securities
(“ Drag-Along Rights ”) then held by every
Employee Shareholder, and (ii) subject to and at the closing
of the Drag-Along Sale, to exercise such number of options or
warrants for such class of Company Securities held by every
Employee Shareholder as is required in order that a sufficient
number of such class of Company Securities are available to
Transfer the relevant Drag-Along Portion of Company Securities of
each Employee Shareholder, in each case for the same consideration
per unit of the relevant class of Company Securities and otherwise
on the same terms and conditions as the Drag-Along Seller,
provided that any Employee Shareholder that holds options or
warrants the exercise price per share of
 
11 





 
which is greater than the per share price at
which such class of Company Securities are to be Transferred to the
Drag-Along Transferee, if required by the Drag-Along Seller to
exercise such options, may, in place of such exercise, submit to
irrevocable cancellation thereof (subject to Section 4.01(b))
without any liability for payment of any exercise price with
respect thereto.  If the Drag-Along Sale is not consummated
with respect to any Company Securities acquired upon exercise of
such options or warrants, such options or warrants shall be deemed
not to have been exercised or canceled, as applicable.

 

The Drag-Along Seller shall provide
notice of such Drag-Along Sale to the Employee Shareholders (a
“ Drag-Along Sale Notice ”) not later than 10
days prior to the proposed Drag-Along Sale.  The Drag-Along
Sale Notice shall identify the transferee, the number and class of
Company Securities subject to the Drag-Along Sale, the type and
amount (or value) of consideration for which a Transfer is proposed
to be made (the “ Drag-Along Sale Price ”) and
all other material terms and conditions of the Drag-Along
Sale.  The number of Company Securities to be sold by each
Employee Shareholder shall be the Drag-Along Portion of the class
of Company Securities that such Shareholder owns.  Each
Employee Shareholder shall be required to (v) participate in
the Drag-Along Sale on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Drag-Along Sale Notice, (w) to tender all its Company
Securities as set forth below, (x) waive dissenter’s
and/or appraisal rights (if any) with respect to the Drag-Along
Sale, (y) vote or consent in favor of such transaction and
(z) take any other necessary or appropriate action in
furtherance of the foregoing.  The price payable in such
Transfer shall be the Drag-Along Sale Price.  Not later than
10 days after the date of the Drag-Along Sale Notice (the “
Drag-Along Sale Notice Period ”), each of the Employee
Shareholders shall deliver to the representative of the Drag-Along
Seller designated in the Drag-Along Sale Notice the certificate and
other applicable instruments representing the Company Securities of
such Employee Shareholder to be included in the Drag-Along Sale,
together with a limited power-of-attorney authorizing the
Drag-Along Seller or such representative to Transfer such Company
Securities on the terms set forth in the Drag-Along Notice and
otherwise on the terms and conditions applicable to the Drag-Along
Seller or otherwise more advantageous to the Drag-Along Seller than
set forth in the Drag-Along Notice and wire transfer instructions
for payment of the cash portion of the consideration to be received
in such Drag-Along Sale, or, if such delivery is not permitted by
applicable law, an unconditional agreement to deliver such Company
Securities pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) at the
closing for such Drag-Along Sale against delivery to such
Shareholder of the consideration therefor.  If an Employee
Shareholder should fail to deliver such certificates to the
Drag-Along Seller, the Company (subject to reversal under
Section 4.01(b)) shall cause the books and records of the
Company to show that such Company Securities are bound by the
provisions of this Section 4.01(a) and that such Company
Securities shall be Transferred to the Drag-Along Transferee
immediately upon surrender for Transfer by the holder
thereof.

 

(b)                                 
The Drag-Along Seller shall have a
period of 120 days from the date of receipt of the Drag-Along Sale
Notice to consummate the Drag-Along Sale on the terms and
conditions set forth in such Drag-Along Sale Notice,
provided that, if such
 
12 





 
Drag-Along Sale is subject to regulatory
approval, such 120-day period shall be extended until the
expiration of five Business Days after all such approvals have been
received, but in no event later than 180 days following the
effective date of the Drag-Along Sale Notice.  If the
Drag-Along Sale shall not have been consummated during such period,
the Drag-Along Seller shall
