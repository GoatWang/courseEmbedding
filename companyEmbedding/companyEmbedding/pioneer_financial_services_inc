About Pioneer Services
As the military division of MidCountry Bank, we’ve been serving the financial needs of active-duty, career-retired and medically retired service members for more than 30 years. Military veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserves who have had a loan with Pioneer Services in the past are also eligible to apply. We offer personal installment loans with fixed rates and payments. That means you’ll know the total cost of your loan up front, with defined payment plans, so you know exactly when it will be paid off.
All ranks and branches of the U.S. military are eligible to apply, even if you've had credit problems in the past. We take great pride in helping folks who've been turned down by other lenders. If your bank or credit union can't help you get the funding you need, that's where we come in. We also report to credit agencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which means if you book a loan with us and pay it down as scheduled, it could help you establish a positive credit history.





A Smarter Way To Borrow
At Pioneer Services, we encourage you to consider all your options when looking for a lender. That’s why we offer a 15-Day Change Your Mind guarantee to give you time to review and compare rates and terms. If you can find a better deal with another lender within 15 days of booking your loan, or if you change your mind, or if you decide you no longer need the loan, you can return the money with no questions asked and no further obligation. We want to help you make the best decision for you and your family.
That's why we also offer free, award-winning financial education in our online Learning Center, featuring helpful blogs, e-books, podcasts, and much more. Our goal is to provide the tools and guidance you need to become financially secure, so you can focus on your duties as a service member instead of worrying about money problems. 





All Pioneer Services personal installment loans are originated through MidCountry Bank, which offers the protections and security of a federally regulated institution, and is a member FDIC. Loan approval, term, amount, and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) are dependent upon each applicant’s credit qualifications. Loan amounts are available between $500 and $10,000 with terms from 12 to 48 months. APRs range from 11.99% to 35.95%, with the lower rates available to those with stronger credit profiles. For example, a $4,000 loan amount over a 36 month term with a 30.82% APR would have a monthly payment of $171.60. All loans are unsecured, meaning that no collateral is required. In all cases, Pioneer Services seeks to provide a loan that fits your needs, with payments you can afford. And because we report to the credit bureaus, consistent repayment behavior could help improve your credit score.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/01/2016
            

                BBB has determined that Pioneer Financial Services Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Dream, Plan, Thrive…Together We Can
At Pioneer Financial Group we believe that to achieve your financial and life goals you need to develop a plan to serve as your roadmap to independence and choice. The simple truth is that most folks want a sense of security with assurances that they are ‘OK’ or that they are on the right track.

About Pioneer Services
Pioneer Services has provided financial services and lending to the military community for over 30 years, helping 1.4 million military families along the way. As the military division of MidCountry Bank, a federal savings bank, Pioneer Services provides access to short-term personal loans, VA home loans, and online financial education information and tools. 
We truly understand how unique your life is, from the challenges you’re facing to the future you’re planning for. That’s why Pioneer Services offers help to all ranks and branches of the military, including active duty, career retired, medically retired, veterans, and members of the National Guard and Reserves. How can we help you today?

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS & SERVICES
At Pioneer Services, we’ve seen firsthand how military families with low or limited credit scores are often underserved by many mainstream financial institutions. It’s not always easy to know where to turn for help. Pioneer Services is here for you. In 2007, Pioneer Services was acquired by MidCountry Financial Corp., a diversified financial services holding company, and became the military division of MidCountry Bank. That means our customers get the protection and security of a federally regulated financial institution, and the flexibility and speed you need.

MILITARY PERSONAL LOANS
Military life often presents unique financial challenges. We offer short-term loans at a fixed rate with fixed payments—the perfect way to get the financial assistance you need for emergencies, travel, moving, family needs, vehicle repair and other expenses. And it's all worry-free thanks to our 15-day, risk-free guarantee. We encourage you to compare our rates and terms against other lenders, and share details with your family, advisors or chain of command. If you find a better loan, or change your mind and no longer need the loan, simply cancel your Pioneer Services loan with no obligation and at no cost to you. Just return the funds in full within 15 days of signing your loan and your account will be closed. It's that easy.
VA HOME LOANS
If you’ve always dreamed of owning your own home, now is a great time to buy — with a MidCountry VA Home Loan offered through Pioneer Services. MidCountry Bank is an approved VA lender in all 50 states and provides new purchase and refinance mortgage loans to eligible active-duty military and retired veterans
FINANCIAL EDUCATION
We're dedicated to helping military service members take control of their financial life. Our award-winning military financial education tools and programs offer practical ways to get it done, including a Credit Repair Kit, military spouse resources, financial blogs, and more. It's all available in our online learning center.
THE PROTECTION OUR MILITARY DESERVES
As a customer of Pioneer Services you receive the protection and security of a federally regulated financial institution, along with the confidence of knowing that our bank products are subject to federal banking regulation and oversight. Pioneer Services voluntarily complies with the APR rate cap as recommended by the Military Lending Act and the FDIC’s small-dollar loan program. And, unlike many lenders, we have no pre-payment penalties or mandatory arbitration clauses.

Making a Payment



Making a Payment
Payment Options Available from DuPont Pioneer and PHI Financial Services, Inc.
Eliminate last-minute payment hassles and manage your DuPont Pioneer seed account or Deferred Payment Loan.
Cash Payments
On the Pioneer website, customers can initiate an electronic payment (ACH) for their Pioneer seed purchases. This option allows for an ACH payment to be scheduled for a future date, eliminating any worries about mail delivery and lessening the risk of missing the due date. Pioneer customers will need to create an on-line account to access this payment option.
Through their Pioneer sales professional, customers can set up future electronic payment of their Pioneer seed purchases, timed to the specific needs of their operation. This option - which doesn't require setting up an online account - allows the flexibility of making multiple payments from different accounts if desired. All that customers' need to do is provide their financial institution and checking account details to their Pioneer sales professional in advance. (A confirmation letter is sent out to ensure full transparency.) Once established, a payment can be modified or deleted up to the day before the scheduled date with a simple phone call. It's trusted, flexible, and convenient.
BENEFITS: No checks, no stamps, no delays. Customers can schedule payments, timed to meet their cash flow needs. There are no service fees associated with making these payments.
Manage Deferred Payment Loan Payments
Pioneer customers who have a Deferred Payment Loan with PHI Financial Services, Inc. can use the Pioneer website to schedule payments on your Deferred Payment Loan at any time, schedule multiple payments and view all of the loan transactions and links to details regarding purchases. You will need to create an account to access this payment option and loan information. You may also call Customer Service at 1-800-248-4030 and select option 1 to initiate an electronic payment via your telephone or select option 3 to initiate an electronic payment with a customer service representative.
BENEFITS: No checks and no stamps required. Scheduling multiple payments is a convenient service that can be used to match cash flow for your operations. There are no service fees associated with making an online payment.
Get Started Today
If you are new to making online payments, you will need to create an account. If you have registered for a Pioneer account and don't remember your username or password, please call us at 1-800-233-7333 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central time.
Pioneer customers who have not yet created an account can find their Business Partner ID on their Pioneer invoice or Deferred Payment Loan correspondence to get started. Click the Sign In link in the upper right corner of the site to get started.

About Pioneer Services
As the military division of MidCountry Bank, we’ve been serving the financial needs of active-duty, career-retired and medically retired service members for more than 30 years. Military veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserves who have had a loan with Pioneer Services in the past are also eligible to apply. We offer personal installment loans with fixed rates and payments. That means you’ll know the total cost of your loan up front, with defined payment plans, so you know exactly when it will be paid off.
All ranks and branches of the U.S. military are eligible to apply, even if you've had credit problems in the past. We take great pride in helping folks who've been turned down by other lenders. If your bank or credit union can't help you get the funding you need, that's where we come in. We also report to credit agencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which means if you book a loan with us and pay it down as scheduled, it could help you establish a positive credit history.





A Smarter Way To Borrow
At Pioneer Services, we encourage you to consider all your options when looking for a lender. That’s why we offer a 15-Day Change Your Mind guarantee to give you time to review and compare rates and terms. If you can find a better deal with another lender within 15 days of booking your loan, or if you change your mind, or if you decide you no longer need the loan, you can return the money with no questions asked and no further obligation. We want to help you make the best decision for you and your family.
That's why we also offer free, award-winning financial education in our online Learning Center, featuring helpful blogs, e-books, podcasts, and much more. Our goal is to provide the tools and guidance you need to become financially secure, so you can focus on your duties as a service member instead of worrying about money problems. 





All Pioneer Services personal installment loans are originated through MidCountry Bank, which offers the protections and security of a federally regulated institution, and is a member FDIC. Loan approval, term, amount, and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) are dependent upon each applicant’s credit qualifications. Loan amounts are available between $500 and $10,000 with terms from 12 to 48 months. APRs range from 11.99% to 35.95%, with the lower rates available to those with stronger credit profiles. For example, a $4,000 loan amount over a 36 month term with a 30.82% APR would have a monthly payment of $171.60. All loans are unsecured, meaning that no collateral is required. In all cases, Pioneer Services seeks to provide a loan that fits your needs, with payments you can afford. And because we report to the credit bureaus, consistent repayment behavior could help improve your credit score.

About Pioneer Services
As the military division of MidCountry Bank, we’ve been serving the financial needs of active-duty, career-retired and medically retired service members for more than 30 years. Military veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserves who have had a loan with Pioneer Services in the past are also eligible to apply. We offer personal installment loans with fixed rates and payments. That means you’ll know the total cost of your loan up front, with defined payment plans, so you know exactly when it will be paid off.
All ranks and branches of the U.S. military are eligible to apply, even if you've had credit problems in the past. We take great pride in helping folks who've been turned down by other lenders. If your bank or credit union can't help you get the funding you need, that's where we come in. We also report to credit agencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which means if you book a loan with us and pay it down as scheduled, it could help you establish a positive credit history.





A Smarter Way To Borrow
At Pioneer Services, we encourage you to consider all your options when looking for a lender. That’s why we offer a 15-Day Change Your Mind guarantee to give you time to review and compare rates and terms. If you can find a better deal with another lender within 15 days of booking your loan, or if you change your mind, or if you decide you no longer need the loan, you can return the money with no questions asked and no further obligation. We want to help you make the best decision for you and your family.
That's why we also offer free, award-winning financial education in our online Learning Center, featuring helpful blogs, e-books, podcasts, and much more. Our goal is to provide the tools and guidance you need to become financially secure, so you can focus on your duties as a service member instead of worrying about money problems. 





All Pioneer Services personal installment loans are originated through MidCountry Bank, which offers the protections and security of a federally regulated institution, and is a member FDIC. Loan approval, term, amount, and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) are dependent upon each applicant’s credit qualifications. Loan amounts are available between $500 and $10,000 with terms from 12 to 48 months. APRs range from 11.99% to 35.95%, with the lower rates available to those with stronger credit profiles. For example, a $4,000 loan amount over a 36 month term with a 30.82% APR would have a monthly payment of $171.60. All loans are unsecured, meaning that no collateral is required. In all cases, Pioneer Services seeks to provide a loan that fits your needs, with payments you can afford. And because we report to the credit bureaus, consistent repayment behavior could help improve your credit score.
