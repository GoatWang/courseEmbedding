History[edit]
ACI was founded in Omaha, Nebraska as Applied Communications Inc in 1975 to develop software for communications applications making use of the new NonStop computers from the then Tandem Computers. The original founders were James Cody, Dave Willadsen, and Dennis Gates. Chuck Hackett, Charly Foglesong, and Mike May began ACI's relationship with Tandem. Many early projects involved building systems to handle ATMs, front ending the bank core banking systems, which led to the launch of the first product, BASE24, in 1982. BASE24 was originally coined by a salesman. The name was meant to represent "Baseline Software for 24 hour-per-day system operations".
Over time BASE24 was expanded to service transactions from other channels such as POS terminals and branch systems. And the product portfolio grew to cover more functions around card transactions such as clearing and settlement and fraud detection. The hardware utilised for these products was also expanded to include suppliers including IBM, HP, Stratus and Sun Microsystems.
In the 1990s ACI's product range was extended to cover wholesale banking payments with solutions for ACH transactions and wire transfers leading to the acquisition of IntraNet in 1998,[2] which expanded the product range with the Money Transfer System product.
Since 1995, ACI has been publicly traded on NASDAQ, initially under the name Transaction Systems Architects (TSA), and since July 2007 under the name ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACIW).[3] Prior to that ACI had periods under US West and Tandem ownership and as a private company.
In November 2009 it was announced ACI would buy Euronet Essentis to expand card issuing and merchant management capabilities[4] and in March 2011 agreement was reached to acquire ISD Corporation to broaden payment product offerings for retailers.[5]
ACI purchased S1 Corporation in February 2012.[6][7]

History[edit]
ACI was founded in Omaha, Nebraska as Applied Communications Inc in 1975 to develop software for communications applications making use of the new NonStop computers from the then Tandem Computers. The original founders were James Cody, Dave Willadsen, and Dennis Gates. Chuck Hackett, Charly Foglesong, and Mike May began ACI's relationship with Tandem. Many early projects involved building systems to handle ATMs, front ending the bank core banking systems, which led to the launch of the first product, BASE24, in 1982. BASE24 was originally coined by a salesman. The name was meant to represent "Baseline Software for 24 hour-per-day system operations".
Over time BASE24 was expanded to service transactions from other channels such as POS terminals and branch systems. And the product portfolio grew to cover more functions around card transactions such as clearing and settlement and fraud detection. The hardware utilised for these products was also expanded to include suppliers including IBM, HP, Stratus and Sun Microsystems.
In the 1990s ACI's product range was extended to cover wholesale banking payments with solutions for ACH transactions and wire transfers leading to the acquisition of IntraNet in 1998,[2] which expanded the product range with the Money Transfer System product.
Since 1995, ACI has been publicly traded on NASDAQ, initially under the name Transaction Systems Architects (TSA), and since July 2007 under the name ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACIW).[3] Prior to that ACI had periods under US West and Tandem ownership and as a private company.
In November 2009 it was announced ACI would buy Euronet Essentis to expand card issuing and merchant management capabilities[4] and in March 2011 agreement was reached to acquire ISD Corporation to broaden payment product offerings for retailers.[5]
ACI purchased S1 Corporation in February 2012.[6][7]

History[edit]
ACI was founded in Omaha, Nebraska as Applied Communications Inc in 1975 to develop software for communications applications making use of the new NonStop computers from the then Tandem Computers. The original founders were James Cody, Dave Willadsen, and Dennis Gates. Chuck Hackett, Charly Foglesong, and Mike May began ACI's relationship with Tandem. Many early projects involved building systems to handle ATMs, front ending the bank core banking systems, which led to the launch of the first product, BASE24, in 1982. BASE24 was originally coined by a salesman. The name was meant to represent "Baseline Software for 24 hour-per-day system operations".
Over time BASE24 was expanded to service transactions from other channels such as POS terminals and branch systems. And the product portfolio grew to cover more functions around card transactions such as clearing and settlement and fraud detection. The hardware utilised for these products was also expanded to include suppliers including IBM, HP, Stratus and Sun Microsystems.
In the 1990s ACI's product range was extended to cover wholesale banking payments with solutions for ACH transactions and wire transfers leading to the acquisition of IntraNet in 1998,[2] which expanded the product range with the Money Transfer System product.
Since 1995, ACI has been publicly traded on NASDAQ, initially under the name Transaction Systems Architects (TSA), and since July 2007 under the name ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACIW).[3] Prior to that ACI had periods under US West and Tandem ownership and as a private company.
In November 2009 it was announced ACI would buy Euronet Essentis to expand card issuing and merchant management capabilities[4] and in March 2011 agreement was reached to acquire ISD Corporation to broaden payment product offerings for retailers.[5]
ACI purchased S1 Corporation in February 2012.[6][7]

History[edit]
ACI was founded in Omaha, Nebraska as Applied Communications Inc in 1975 to develop software for communications applications making use of the new NonStop computers from the then Tandem Computers. The original founders were James Cody, Dave Willadsen, and Dennis Gates. Chuck Hackett, Charly Foglesong, and Mike May began ACI's relationship with Tandem. Many early projects involved building systems to handle ATMs, front ending the bank core banking systems, which led to the launch of the first product, BASE24, in 1982. BASE24 was originally coined by a salesman. The name was meant to represent "Baseline Software for 24 hour-per-day system operations".
Over time BASE24 was expanded to service transactions from other channels such as POS terminals and branch systems. And the product portfolio grew to cover more functions around card transactions such as clearing and settlement and fraud detection. The hardware utilised for these products was also expanded to include suppliers including IBM, HP, Stratus and Sun Microsystems.
In the 1990s ACI's product range was extended to cover wholesale banking payments with solutions for ACH transactions and wire transfers leading to the acquisition of IntraNet in 1998,[2] which expanded the product range with the Money Transfer System product.
Since 1995, ACI has been publicly traded on NASDAQ, initially under the name Transaction Systems Architects (TSA), and since July 2007 under the name ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACIW).[3] Prior to that ACI had periods under US West and Tandem ownership and as a private company.
In November 2009 it was announced ACI would buy Euronet Essentis to expand card issuing and merchant management capabilities[4] and in March 2011 agreement was reached to acquire ISD Corporation to broaden payment product offerings for retailers.[5]
ACI purchased S1 Corporation in February 2012.[6][7]

History[edit]
ACI was founded in Omaha, Nebraska as Applied Communications Inc in 1975 to develop software for communications applications making use of the new NonStop computers from the then Tandem Computers. The original founders were James Cody, Dave Willadsen, and Dennis Gates. Chuck Hackett, Charly Foglesong, and Mike May began ACI's relationship with Tandem. Many early projects involved building systems to handle ATMs, front ending the bank core banking systems, which led to the launch of the first product, BASE24, in 1982. BASE24 was originally coined by a salesman. The name was meant to represent "Baseline Software for 24 hour-per-day system operations".
Over time BASE24 was expanded to service transactions from other channels such as POS terminals and branch systems. And the product portfolio grew to cover more functions around card transactions such as clearing and settlement and fraud detection. The hardware utilised for these products was also expanded to include suppliers including IBM, HP, Stratus and Sun Microsystems.
In the 1990s ACI's product range was extended to cover wholesale banking payments with solutions for ACH transactions and wire transfers leading to the acquisition of IntraNet in 1998,[2] which expanded the product range with the Money Transfer System product.
Since 1995, ACI has been publicly traded on NASDAQ, initially under the name Transaction Systems Architects (TSA), and since July 2007 under the name ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACIW).[3] Prior to that ACI had periods under US West and Tandem ownership and as a private company.
In November 2009 it was announced ACI would buy Euronet Essentis to expand card issuing and merchant management capabilities[4] and in March 2011 agreement was reached to acquire ISD Corporation to broaden payment product offerings for retailers.[5]
ACI purchased S1 Corporation in February 2012.[6][7]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
