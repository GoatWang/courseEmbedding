Features


Acrimetal is extremely durable, has excellent adhesion to metal and galvanized surfaces and contains 
			rust inhibitive pigments for added protection.  It is a versatile replacement for conventional solvent-borne industrial 
			primer/finish systems.   Some flash rust may appear in the first coat when applying to bare ferrous metal.  This does not 
			affect the integrity of the coating.  A second coat will cover the discoloration and seal pinholes.



Composition


Acrylic
			Titanium dioxide & extender pigments
			Contains no lead or mercury
			VOC compliant



























Surface Preparation


Surfaces must be sound, dry and clean.  Remove previous coatings that have poor adhesion.  
			Wash areas where mold and mildew are present.  Remove all dirt, oil, grease, wax and/or other contaminant.  Repair 
			cracks and fill voids.  De-gloss shiny surfaces by lightly sanding.  Clean and prime all bare metal surfaces with an 
			appropriate primer.  Prime areas as needed.  Test for adhesion and compatibility with existing finishes.



Disposal


Never pour leftover coating down any sink or drainuse up material on the job or seal can and 
			store safely for future use.  Do not incinerate closed containers.  For specific disposal or recycle guidelines, contact 
			your local waste management agency or district.  Always attempt to recycle whenever possible.

			publication.  Formulation improvements may be made from time to time that may affect these figures to some degree.  Also, 
			manufacturing tolerances of ą2% are considered acceptable.  Whenever a change is made that the Manufacturer considers 
			substantial, the Product Analysis will be revised.

                    Enjoy the beautiful Olympic Mt view as well as Mt Rainier. Kayak down the Washington Narrows. Hop on a ferry to Seattle to see a Seahawks game. Just a one hour ferry ride to down town Seattle. Forget the Seattle morning traffic. Have a cup of coffee and a boat ride to work. Area of affordable older homes. Some need elbow grease, but worth it in the end.

                    If there's one thing I love about Bremerton, it's the active, updated waterfront! By boat or by car, "downtown" Bremerton is worth a visit. Grab a bite to eat at Anthony's, the waterfront upscale restaurant with a view of the marina. Head over to the public fountains, to watch an amazing water display. Look south for the best view of our Washington State Ferries coming and going. As far as views come, it doesnt get much better than this!

Environmental tolerance of an invasive riparian tree and its potential for continued spread in the southwestern USProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2010Author(s): Reynolds, L.V. and D.J. CooperSuggested Citation: Reynolds, L.V. and D.J. Cooper. 2010. Environmental tolerance of an invasive riparian tree and its potential for continued spread in the southwestern US. Journal of Vegetation Science. 21(4): 733-743. Questions: Exotic plant invasion may be aided by facilitation and broad tolerance of environmental conditions, yet these processes are poorly understood in species-rich ecosystems such as riparian zones. In the southwestern United States (US) two plant species have invaded riparian zones: tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima, T. chinensis, and their hybrids) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). We addressed the following questions: (1) is Russian olive able to tolerate drier and shadier conditions than cottonwood and tamarisk? (2) Can tamarisk and cottonwood facilitate Russian olive invasion?
Location: Arid riparian zones, southwestern US.
Methods: We analyzed riparian tree seedling requirements in a controlled experiment, performed empirical field studies, and analyzed stable oxygen isotopes to determine the water sources used by Russian olive...

       Description    The Monkey Mat is a clean, portable, water-repellent "floor" you can take everywhere!  This 5' x 8' ripstop nylon mat is perfect for use indoors or outdoors: under your crates or an ex-pen at agility trials, picnics, concerts, beach, travel, sporting events, outdoor festivals, kids, and more!  The Monkey Mat is ultra compact and fits inside of a 6" x 6" zippered pouch. The pouch is actually attached to the mat so that you can't lose track of it. And there's a carabiner attachment for the pouch so you can easily latch your folded up Monkey Mat onto a bag, backpack, crate, etc. This mat is lightweight—only 14 oz.—so it really can go everywhere. The ripstop nylon is durable, but still soft to the touch so there's no "plasticky" feel. It's also water repellant so that spills, grass, sand, dirt, etc. shake right off. There are sewn-in corner weights to keep the Monkey Mat from blowing away in the wind as well as corner loops which you can use to stake down the mat (stakes sold separately) or tie multiple Monkey Mats together for an even bigger clean floor. In the center of the mat there are loops to which you can attach keys or other items that you need to keep track of. Machine washable.

The free shipping offer only applies to products that are shipped directly from Clean Run and that do not have a notation in the product description indicating the item is excluded from free shipping offers. Items in the store may be excluded because of weight, box size, or because they must be shipped separately from a different location. In these cases, there is not only a special shipping note in the product description, a green information icon  will appear next to that item in your shopping cart to indicate that shipping will be charged for this particular item, regardless of the order total.


The cost of any item excluded from free shipping is not applied toward the $100 minimum required for free shipping. If the other items in your shopping cart total over $100, however, then you will receive free shipping for those items. The yellow box at the bottom of the shopping cart that tells you how far away you are from free shipping automatically excludes ineligible items and reflects whether the rest of your order is eligible for free shipping, or how much more you need to spend to get free shipping for the rest of the order. If that box says you are eligible for free shipping, then the shipping charges that appear at checkout are only for the product that is excluded from free shipping.


The shipping address must be in the contiguous 48 United States. Hawaii, Alaska, and the following USA military posts and territories are excluded: AA, AE, AP, AS, GU, PW, PR, VI.


Your order must total $100 or more before taxes (Mass. residents only) and after any discounts or promotional codes are applied. This means that if you buy a product that's on sale for 30% off, for example, the discounted price of the product will be used for calculating free shipping, not the original price of the product.


Charges related to shipping will not be included to meet the $100 minimum.


If you have an item in your cart that always qualifies for free USA shipping no matter what the order total (such as shoes) plus other products, the shopping cart will apply the price of the shoes toward the free shipping offer for the other items in the cart. However, if your order does not go over $100, the weight of the shoes will not be included when calculating shipping charges; you will only pay shipping for the other items in your shopping cart.


We will ship your order using the ground delivery service of our choice. If you select a method that is not marked "free," your order does not qualify for free shipping. You will be charged the shipping price displayed in the shopping cart.


You must tell 5 people about our website and how great our products and customer service are—OK, so this isn't really an official requirement, but we would appreciate it if you told your friends!

   This product must be special ordered from the manufacturer so it will be shipped separately from any other products that you order from the store. When you check out, the shopping cart will display the method by which this item will be shipped—you cannot select a different method. The cart will also display the shipping charges, if any, for this item.
If you have also ordered products that will ship directly from the Clean Run warehouse, then you will be prompted at checkout to select a method for shipping those items. 
Because this is a special order item, please be aware that we will process your payment immediately (as opposed to when an order ships).

  If you live in the continental USA, you will not be charged any shipping for this item when you checkout. (Hawaii, Alaska, and the following USA military posts and territories are excluded: AA, AE, AP, AS, GU, PW, PR, VI.)
Please note that this free shipping offer applies only to this product, NOT to your entire order. If your order includes other items from the store that are not marked as having free shipping, you will be shown shipping charges for just those items when you check out—the weight of the item that qualifies for free shipping is not included in those shipping calculations.
 



×
   This item is excluded from our $100 free shipping offer because of its weight or box size, or because it must be shipped separately from a different location. Shipping will be charged for this particular item, regardless of your order total.
The cost of any item excluded from free shipping is not applied toward the $100 minimum required for free shipping. If the other items in your shopping cart total over $100, however, then you will receive free shipping for those items. The yellow box at the bottom of the shopping cart that tells you how far away you are from free shipping automatically excludes ineligible items and reflects whether the rest of your order is eligible for free shipping, or how much more you need to spend to get free shipping for the rest of the order. If that box says you are eligible for free shipping, then the shipping charges that appear at checkout are only for the product that is excluded from free shipping.



×
 Because of its size or weight, or because it is an aerosol product whose contents are under pressure, this product can only be shipped in the USA via UPS Ground service. Sorry, no air shipping. This item cannot be sent to Alaska, Hawaii, APO, FPO, or international addresses.
