  Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE: TRC) announced today that it has hired Gregory S. Bielli to be the Company's new President and CEO. Bielli, who is 53, will replace the Company's long standing CEO, Robert A. Stine when Stine retires at the end of this year. Bielli will join the Company in September and will be the President and Chief Operating Officer until Stine's retirement.   Gregory S. Bielli, new President of Tejon Ranch Co. (Photo: Business Wire)   Bielli has nearly 25 years experience in real estate, land acquisition, development and financing. He comes to Tejon Ranch most recently from Newland Communities, one of the country's largest and most successful master planned community developers. As President of Newland's Western Region, Bielli was responsible for overseeing management of all operational aspects of Newland's portfolio of master planned residential, commercial and retail real estate projects in the region. He was also responsible for growth and acquisitions in the region that includes the states of Arizona, California and Colorado.  "We are very pleased Greg Bielli will be joining Tejon Ranch Company," said Kent Snyder, Chairman of the Tejon Ranch Board of Directors. "We believe that with his skills, capabilities and experience, he is the ideal person to assume leadership of this great Company."  "This is a tremendous opportunity for me and I'm grateful the Board is entrusting me with this important responsibility," said Bielli. "Tejon Ranch has a remarkable legacy and Bob Stine's 17 years at the helm has been a significant part of the story of Tejon Ranch. The Ranch has an equally exciting future and I'm happy to be chosen to lead the next chapter."  Bielli earned a bachelor’s degree in Political Science from the University of Arizona in 1983. He and his wife Vicki will be relocating to Bakersfield, California.

Tejon Ranch is home to breathtaking scenery,.

Tejon Ranch Co. laid off 11 employees Monday in what it said was a difficult but necessary response to less than favorable agricultural and commodity prices, including tepid prices for crude oil.In an emailed response to questions from The Californian, the real estate development and agribusiness company, whose principal asset is its 270,000-acre land holding approximately 30 miles south of Bakersfield, said it reduced its workforce across several divisions of the company.The reduction of 11 positions, the release said, included both managerial and non-managerial employees. In light of the challenging economic climate Tejon is facing, the release said, “the reduction is necessary to size the company appropriately in order to engage in the execution of the company’s long-term business plan.”The layoffs still leave approximately 150 employees at Tejon, a company spokesman told The Californian.Affected employees were offered severance packages and outplacement services.“This reduction is difficult for the Tejon family, and I am personally grateful for the years of service these employees provided to Tejon Ranch,” Gregory S. Bielli, Tejon’s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “These reductions are a necessary step to continue positioning the company for the effective execution of our business plan.“I offer my personal gratitude and appreciation to each employee impacted by this decision for their commitment to Tejon Ranch.”

Mr. Bielli made $3.3M last year ... think it might be appropriate to look at cuts there instead of laying off hard working people?

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
