Who We ArepSivida is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative miniaturized, sustained-release drug delivery products and technologies to treat serious, debilitating diseases of the eye that can lead to blindness. The dedicated team of scientists at pSivida has developed three of the only four products approved by the FDA for the long-term, sustained-release delivery of drug to treat chronic back of the eye diseases.
pSivida’s has completed two Phase 3 studies to support U.S. registration of its Durasert three-year treatment for posterior uveitis. The second Phase 3 study achieved its primary efficacy endpoint with high statistical significance (p<.001). The study involved 153 patients and the primary endpoint was prevention of recurrence of posterior uveitis at six months with patients continuing to be followed for 36 months. Durasert three-year insert demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrence of posterior segment uveitis through six months; 21.8% of Durasert treated patients had a recurrence compared to 53.8% of patients in the sham group. The results of the second Phase 3 study confirm the efficacy and safety profile of the Durasert insert demonstrated in the first Phase 3 study which also met its primary endpoint at six months (p<.001). Data from the first Phase 3 study through 12 months of follow up were recently presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) meeting in May of this year. The data at 12 months demonstrated the durability of the treatment effect; 27.6% of Durasert treated patients had a recurrence at 12 months compared to 85.7% of patients in the sham group.
pSivida has ongoing collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to develop sustained-release products to treat retinal diseases and other ocular conditions. pSivida is also working with the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) to assess the efficacy of a titanium screw drug implant to treat pain associated with severe osteoarthritis of the knee.

Product PipelinepSivida has developed three FDA-approved products utilizing our proprietary Durasert™ Technology to treat serious back-of-the-eye diseases. We are currently in late-stage development of a Durasert three-year product to treat posterior uveitis.
We are utilizing our Durasert bioerodible technology platform in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies to develop new sustained-release products to treat retinal diseases and other ocular conditions.
We are expanding our focus beyond eye diseases to leverage our Durasert Technology for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis of the knee.











Product/ProgramPhase




Durasert three-year treatment for posterior segment uveitisFiling


Duraseret shorter duration treatment for posterior segment uveitisPreclinical


Durasert TKI for Wet AMDPreclinical


Durasert Knee OAPhase 1


Front of the eye diseasePreclinical


Back of the eye diseasePreclinical







Iluvien®ILUVIEN® is an injectable, non-erodible, intravitreal implant for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), a serious condition that can lead to blindness. DME affects approximately one million people in the U.S. alone. ILUVIEN® utilizes pSivida’s proprietary third generation Durasert™ Technology. It is specifically designed to release the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide (FA) for up to three years with a single injection to the back of the eye.
ILUVIEN is licensed to Alimera Sciences, Inc. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ILUVIEN for the treatment of DME for patients who did not have a significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) when treated with a course of corticosteroids.
Additionally, ILUVIEN for DME has received marketing authorization in 17 EU countries, where it is approved for use in the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies.




Durasert™ Three-year for Posterior UveitisThe three-year Durasert insert has the potential to be the first product approved to help prevent recurrence of this devastating condition for up to three years with a single intravitreal injection administered in an office-based setting. pSivida expects to file an NDA with the FDA during fourth quarter of 2017. pSivida has out-licensed the rights for the new uveitis indication for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to Alimera Sciences as part of a broader amendment to its current licensing and collaboration agreement for Iluvien in Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).




Durasert™ Shorter Duration for Posterior UveitispSivida is currently developing a shorter-duration sustained-release fluocinolone acetonide product in the proven Durasert™Technology for the treatment of posterior uveitis. Posterior uveitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye that can lead to blindness. The shorter duration product will provide retina and uveitis specialists with an additional treatment option to gauge patient response to therapy before using a longer-duration device.




Durasert™ Bioerodible TKIWet AMD remains an area of great unmet medical need. pSivida is focused on developing a sustained-release bioerodible device containing a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to assess its potential to treat wet AMD. In-vitro release profiles have been assessed for several TKIs. pSivida is actively seeking partners interested in advancing the program to clinical-stage development.




Durasert™ for Knee Osteoarthritis (OA)pSivida is working with the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City to assess the safety and efficacy of a titanium screw drug implant containing the corticosteroid dexamethasone to treat pain associated with severe osteoarthritis of the knee. The screw implant utilizes the Durasert™ Technology and is designed to release a low dose of dexamethasone for approximately one year. This investigator-initiated study is being conducted by HSS. A total of 6 patients have been enrolled as of the 2nd quarter of 2017 and will be followed for a period 6 months. In addition to safety, the study will evaluate efficacy parameters such as relief of pain and improvements in stiffness and function. If found effective, the implant could provide long-term pain relief and potentially delay the need for knee replacement surgery. Osteoarthritis of the knee affects millions of patients in the U.S and current treatment options to manage pain, including systemic administration of opioids and NSAIDs, are associated with potentially serious side effects. Current injectable steroids provide relief for only 10-12 weeks, thus necessitating multiple injections and office visits.

WATERTOWN, Mass., June  22, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- pSivida Corp. (NASDAQ:PSDV) (ASX:PVA), a leader in the development of sustained release drug products and technologies, has submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), seeking approval to market the Company's Durasert three-year treatment for posterior segment uveitis in the European Union (EU).
"Our MAA submission is another significant milestone delivered on time by the pSivida team," commented Nancy Lurker, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Durasert three-year uveitis treatment, our lead product candidate, has now proven to be highly effective in reducing the recurrence of uveitis in two Phase 3 studies.  Both studies illustrate the benefits Durasert brings to those patients suffering from this disease, which is a leading cause of blindness.  As we await the review from the EU regulators, we continue to have advanced discussions with potential partners and are focused on entering into an out-licensing agreement for Durasert in the EU sometime this summer."
In each of pSivida's two Phase 3 trials for its Durasert three-year uveitis treatment, the primary efficacy endpoint was successfully achieved at six months with a p value <0.001. In addition, the safety profile of patients treated with Durasert three-year uveitis treatment was comparable to the safety profile of existing steroid uveitis treatments, which are considered standard of care for this disease.
Posterior segment uveitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, often involving the retina, which is believed to be a leading cause of blindness in the developed and developing countries. It affects people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. In the U.S. and EU, posterior uveitis affects ~200,000 people, annually. Today, patients with posterior uveitis are typically treated with systemic steroids, but over time frequently develop serious side effects that can limit effective dosing. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapy with systemic immune suppressants or biologics, which themselves can have severe side effects including an increased risk of cancer.
About pSivida Corp.pSivida Corp. (www.psivida.com), headquartered in Watertown, MA, is a leader in the development of sustained-release drug products for treating eye diseases. pSivida has developed three of only four FDA-approved sustained-release treatments for back-of-the-eye diseases. The most recent, ILUVIEN®, a micro-insert for diabetic macular edema, licensed to Alimera Sciences, is currently sold directly in the U.S. and three EU countries. Retisert®, an implant for posterior uveitis, is licensed to and sold by Bausch & Lomb. pSivida's lead product candidate, Durasert™ micro-insert for posterior segment uveitis being independently developed, is currently in pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. pSivida's pre-clinical development program is focused on using its core platform technology, Durasert, to deliver drugs to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases.

pSivida Corp. Reports FDA Approval of ILUVIEN® for Diabetic Macular Edema


pSivida earns $25 million milestone

 WATERTOWN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      pSivida Corp. (NASDAQ: PSDV, ASX: PVA), a leader in the development of

      sustained release, drug delivery products for treating eye diseases,

      today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has

      approved ILUVIEN® for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). It

      is indicated for patients who have been previously treated with a course

      of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in

      intraocular pressure (IOP). A single injection of the ILUVIEN

      micro-insert provides sustained treatment of DME for 36 months.

      Approximately 560,000 people in the U.S. are estimated to have

      clinically significant DME, the most frequent cause of vision loss in

      individuals with diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in young

      and middle-aged adults in developed countries. ILUVIEN is expected to be

      commercially available in the U.S. in early 2015.

    

FDA approval of ILUVIEN entitles pSivida to a $25 million milestone from

      its licensee Alimera Sciences. pSivida will also be entitled to 20% of

      the net profits from sales of ILUVIEN in the U.S.

    


      "FDA approval of ILUVIEN, our third FDA-approved product for retinal

      disease, provides an important treatment option for DME patients in the

      U.S., the majority of whose DME, despite anti-VEGF intra-ocular

      injections as frequently as monthly, is not optimally managed. ILUVIEN's

      clinical trials showed that ILUVIEN can actually reverse vision loss in

      many DME patients. Another advantage of ILUVIEN over existing therapies

      is that a single injection provides sustained therapy for three years,"

      said Paul Ashton, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of

      pSivida.

    


      "The $25 million milestone will help finance our ongoing product

      development program, including Medidur™ for posterior uveitis and

      Tethadur™ for the sustained delivery of biologics," added Dr. Ashton.

      pSivida is independently developing Medidur, an injectable, sustained

      release micro-insert of the same design and delivering the same drug as

      ILUVIEN, for the treatment of chronic posterior uveitis, the third

      largest cause of blindness in the U.S. The Company plans to seek FDA

      approval of this product on the basis of its ongoing single Phase III

      clinical trial. Enrollment of this study is expected to be completed by

      the end of the first quarter of calendar 2015.

    


      ILUVIEN is already commercially available in the U.K. and Germany, and

      has received or is pending marketing approval in seventeen other EU

      countries, for the treatment of patients with the chronic DME

      insufficiently responsive to available therapies. "We are very pleased

      that the FDA's approval of ILUVIEN is not limited, as in the EU, to the

      subset of patients with chronic DME, patients who have failed other

      therapies, or patients who have had cataract surgery," continued Dr.

      Ashton.

    


      ILUVIEN is an injectable micro-insert that provides sustained treatment

      through continuous delivery of a submicrogram dose of the corticosteroid

      fluocinolone acetonide for 36 months. Current standard-of-care therapy

      requires anti-VEGF injections into the eye as frequently as monthly, and

      studies show that over 50 percent of patients are not optimally managed

      with this treatment. FDA approval was based on clinical trial data that

      showed that at month 24, 28.7 percent of patients receiving ILUVIEN

      experienced an improvement from baseline in their best corrected visual

      acuity on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) eye

      chart of 15 letters or more. This improvement in vision was maintained

      through 36 months, the end of the trials.

    

About ILUVIEN®



      ILUVIEN® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg is a

      sustained release intravitreal implant approved in the United States to

      treat DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of

      corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in

      intraocular pressure. Each ILUVIEN implant is designed to release

      submicrogram levels of fluocinolone acetonide (FAc), a corticosteroid

      for 36 months.

    


      Corticosteroids have a history of effective use in treating ocular

      disease inflammation. ILUVIEN is injected in the back of the patient's

      eye with an applicator that employs a 25-gauge needle, which allows for

      a self-sealing wound. In the FAME™ Study, a phase 3 clinical study of

      ILUVIEN, the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions included

      cataract development and increased ocular pressure.

    

ILUVIEN Important Safety Information



      ILUVIEN contains a corticosteroid and is indicated for the treatment of

      DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of

      corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in

      intraocular pressure.

    


      Intravitreal injections have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye

      inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, and retinal detachments.

      Patients should be monitored following the injection.

    


      Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts,

      increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and may enhance the

      establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or

      viruses.

    


      The implant may migrate into the anterior chamber if the posterior lens

      capsule is not intact. In controlled studies, the most common adverse

      reactions reported were cataract development and increases in

      intraocular pressure.

    


      Patients are advised to have follow-up eye examinations at appropriate

      intervals following treatment with ILUVIEN. Full prescribing information

      will be available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/.

    

About DME



      Diabetic Macular Edema, the primary cause of vision loss associated with

      diabetic retinopathy, is a disease affecting the macula, the part of the

      retina responsible for central vision. When the blood vessel leakage of

      diabetic retinopathy causes swelling in the macula, the condition has

      progressed to DME. The onset of DME is painless and may go undetected by

      the patient until it manifests with the blurring of central vision or

      acute vision loss. The severity of this blurring may range from mild to

      profound loss of vision. The Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic

      Retinopathy found that over a 10-year period approximately 19 percent of

      people with diabetes studied were diagnosed with DME. All people with

      type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk of developing DME. As the

      population of people with diabetes increases, the annual incidence of

      diagnosed DME is expected to increase, as well.

    


      Duration of diabetes is the greatest risk factor for increased

      retinopathy and is associated with an increased prevalence of DME. The

      appearance of retinopathy is associated with an up-regulation of

      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) causing an increase in

      permeability of vessels leading to leakage of fluid. As retinopathy

      worsens, an up-regulation of multiple cytokines (inflammatory factors)

      takes place. Corticosteroids offer a broad effect on down regulation of

      multiple cytokines associated with DME that persists.

pSivida's Durasert™ Three-year Treatment for Posterior Segment Uveitis Successfully Achieves Primary Efficacy Endpoint in Second Phase 3 Study

Highly Significant Difference Observed Between Durasert and Control Group in Primary Efficacy Analysis of Prevention of Uveitis Recurrence
Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m.ET WATERTOWN, Mass., June  13, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- pSivida Corp. (NASDAQ:PSDV) (ASX:PVA), a leader in the development of sustained release drug products and technologies, today announced the Company's second Phase 3 trial of Durasert three-year treatment for posterior segment uveitis achieved the trial's primary endpoint. The study involved 153 patients and the primary endpoint was prevention of recurrence of posterior uveitis at six months with patients continuing to be followed for 36 months. Durasert three-year insert demonstrated a significant reduction in the recurrence of posterior segment uveitis through six months; 21.8% of Durasert-treated 
patients had a recurrence compared to 53.8% of patients in the sham group (p < 0.001). "The data from this trial confirms previous clinical research demonstrating our three-year Durasert insert for posterior segment uveitis may significantly help patients suffering from this devastating disease -- the third leading cause of blindness," said Nancy Lurker, President and CEO of pSivida Corp. "Our market research indicates strong interest in using the product driven by the results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial. We continue to expect the submission of the European Market Authorization Application (MAA) by the end of June, and we remain on track to also file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA in the calendar fourth quarter of 2017." Additional 
safety results from the trial included: Intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation, which can lead to glaucoma, was 2.4 and 1.3 mm Hg (mean) at six months (vs baseline) for Durasert and sham, respectively.Patients requiring IOP-lowering therapy at any time during the first six months follow-up were 41.6% for Durasert and 34.6% for sham. No subject required IOP surgery during the first six months of follow-up.In patients with a natural (phakic) lens at baseline, 4.9% in the Durasert group required a cataract surgery through six months compared to 8.6% in the sham group.  Posterior segment uveitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, often involving the retina, which is believed to be a leading cause of blindness in the developed and developing countries. It affects 
people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. In the U.S., posterior uveitis affects between 80,000 - 100,000 people.  Today, patients with posterior uveitis are typically treated with systemic steroids, but over time frequently develop serious side effects that can limit effective dosing. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapy with systemic immune suppressants or biologics, which themselves can have severe side effects including an increased risk of cancer. "The results of the second Phase 3 study confirm the efficacy and safety profile of the Durasert three-year insert demonstrated in the first Phase 3 study.  Consistent, durable control of chronic posterior segment uveitis is a critical goal of treatment.  The 
three-year Durasert insert has the potential to be the first product approved to help prevent the recurrence of this devastating condition for up to three years with a single intravitreal injection," commented Dr. Jyotirmay Biswas, Professor of Ophthalmology and Director of Uveitis & Ocular Pathology Department, Sankara Nethralaya Ophthalmic Center, Tamil Nadu, India and primary investigator of the study. "Chronic posterior uveitis is challenging to treat as the disease tends to wax and wane over time.  Durasert three-year insert is a single-injection office-based treatment that can last 2-3 years. Therefore, it addresses the need to help prevent recurrences over an extended time period, rather than to treat them episodically, and may represent an exciting new approach to manage 
these patients," added Dr.  Glenn J. Jaffe, Robert Machemer Professor of Ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, NC and one of the world's leading uveitis experts. Conference Call Information  pSivida Corp. will host a live webcast and conference call today, June 13th, at 4:30pm ET. Company management will be joined by Dr. Glenn J. Jaffe, Robert Machemer Professor of Ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, NC.   The conference call may be accessed by dialing (877) 312-7507 from the U.S. and Canada, or (631) 813-4828 from international locations.

					Full Description



pSivida Corp., incorporated on March 20, 2008, develops drug delivery products primarily for the treatment of chronic eye diseases. The Company operates through the biotechnology sector segment. The Company has developed three products for treatment of back-of-the-eye diseases, which include Medidur for posterior segment uveitis, its lead product candidate that is in pivotal Phase III clinical trials; ILUVIEN for diabetic macular edema (DME), its lead licensed product that is sold in the United States and European Union (EU) countries, and Retisert. Its product development program is focused primarily on utilizing its two core technology platforms, Durasert and Tethadur, to deliver drugs and biologics to treat chronic diseases.Medidur is designed to treat chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (posterior segment uveitis). Injected into the eye in an office visit, Medidur is a tiny micro-insert that delivers a micro-dose of a corticosteroid to the back of the eye. The Company is developing Medidur independently. The Company is conducting Phase III trials to assess the safety and efficacy of Medidur for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. These are randomized, sham injection-controlled, double-masked trials. ILUVIEN is an injectable micro-insert that provides treatment of DME from a single injection. ILUVIEN is sold in the United States, where it is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients previously treated with a course of corticosteroids without a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP); in the United Kingdom and Germany, and in Portugal.Retisert is an implant that provides treatment of posterior segment uveitis. Implanted in a surgical procedure, Retisert delivers the same corticosteroid as Medidur but in a larger dose. The Company is focusing on developing products that use its Durasert and Tethadur technology platforms to deliver drugs and biologics to treat wet and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases. The Company commenced an investigational new drug (IND)-enabling study of an injectable, bioerodible micro-insert, which the Company developed to provide delivery of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to treat wet AMD. Its core technology platforms, Durasert and Tethadur, are designed to address the issues of delivery for ophthalmic and other product candidates. The portfolio of its Durasert approved products and product candidates include Steroid implant, TKI insert and Vitrasert. The Company is developing an injectable, bioerodible, sustained-release Durasert insert delivering a TKI for treatment of wet AMD.The Tethadur technology system, which is in pre-clinical development, is designed to provide delivery of large biologic molecules, including peptides, proteins and antibodies. Tethadur utilizes a tunable, biodegradable, biocompatible matrix of nanostructured silica. Biologics are loaded into the matrix and are then released over time as the matrix dissolves. Its research is focused on using its Durasert technology platform and developing its Tethadur delivery platform to deliver therapeutic agents to treat wet and dry AMD, glaucoma and osteoarthritis, as well as to provide systemic delivery of biologics. The Company has developed an implant for the treatment of pain associated with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA). This implant is being studied in an investigator-sponsored, pilot study. The implant is composed of a specially manufactured, surgical screw-like device with an embedded Durasert system that delivers dexamethasone directly to the joint on a sustained basis.The Company competes with Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Roche Group, Novartis AG, Bayer HealthCare, Allergan, Inc. and Abbvie.
