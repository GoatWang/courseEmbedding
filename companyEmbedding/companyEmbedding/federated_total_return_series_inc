Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices.   High-yield, lower-rated securities generally entail greater market, credit/default and liquidity risks and may be more volatile than investment-grade securities.   The value of some mortgage-backed securities may be particularly sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates, and although the securities are generally supported by some form of government or private insurance, there is no assurance that private guarantors or insurers will meet their obligations.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.   These pages include general information and have not been tailored for any specific recipient or recipients.
