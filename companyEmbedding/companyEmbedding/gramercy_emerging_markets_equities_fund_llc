Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries.

The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing.

Long-Only Equity

The Global Optimization Strategy seeks to maximize returns while controlling risk of a portfolio of closed-end funds. There are two advantages to our approach. First, since closed-end funds typically trade at discounts to the value of the underlying securities they hold, we can effectively purchase securities at a discount to the market. The second advantage is one of greater diversification because a portfolio of closed-end funds effectively holds a much broader set of individual securities. Discounts and diversification benefits lead to better returns and lower risk for the product. Portfolio manager, Dr. Tony Tessitore, and his team have extensive experience managing quantitative equity portfolios. This investment strategy was developed by Dr. Tessitore and a team of Ph.D.s led by Dr. Harry Markowitz, Nobel Laureate. 
Gramercy's equity team has a 20-year track record and manages three distinct strategies which differ with respect to their benchmarks, measures of risk and constraints.

The firm, founded in 1998, seeks to provide investors with superior risk-adjusted returns through a comprehensive approach to emerging markets supported by a transparent and robust institutional platform.

Emerging Markets – Our Edge

The investment professionals at Gramercy have dedicated their careers to emerging markets.  Our investment team has an extensive distressed credit core competency.  Due to the hands-on nature of distressed investing, Gramercy has fostered local market relationships that are not easily replicated. For nearly three decades, our investment team has cultivated these deep-rooted, unique local relationships. We believe the combination of our pan-emerging markets expertise and local market relationships give Gramercy a distinct advantage in emerging markets.

An Introduction to Gramercy







Gramercy was founded in 1998 by Robert Koenigsberger, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer, to exploit distressed investment opportunities in emerging markets. 
Gramercy has historically been known as an emerging markets distressed debt specialist, however, as the asset class evolved, so too has our firm. In the infancy of the asset class, emerging markets consisted almost entirely of defaulted debt. Today, the range of investment instruments in emerging markets has expanded to mirror that of developed markets. In response to this evolution, Gramercy has thoughtfully and deliberately expanded our investment capabilities. We offer a wide range of investment solutions across emerging markets. 
Gramercy’s experience predates our founding by over ten years.  Many of our investment professionals have been active investors in emerging markets for their entire careers, which has provided them with a thorough understanding of the complexities of the asset class.  Due to the multi-asset collaborative effort of our Investment Committee, the firm is afforded a unique perspective of the market.
Our extensive emerging markets experience, particularly within the distressed arena, has allowed us to develop deep local relationships in emerging markets countries. In addition to these relationships, our dedicated research team, one of the largest dedicated EM credit research teams in the industry, is able to provide our portfolio managers with the knowledge, confidence and ability to make sound decisions.

Long-Only Debt

UCITS







Alternatives

Emerging Markets Distressed Debt and Special Situations – Seeks to provide superior long-term capital appreciation through proactive, distressed investing in emerging markets corporate, sovereign or quasi-sovereign entities. Strategies target stressed/distressed and defaulted bonds which are typically large, global Eurobond issues, governed by U.S. or U.K. law, underwritten in public capital markets and generally U.S. dollar denominated. Opportunities are identified by our proprietary, fundamental research and both liquid/stressed and distressed/defaulted credits are evaluated to benefit our various mandates. Positions are then sized relative to market liquidity. Alpha generation takes place through bottom-up, intensive credit evaluation/monitoring combined with the top-down perspective of a highly experienced team of career-dedicated emerging markets investors. Portfolios are hedged typically using sovereign credit default swaps. 
Emerging Markets Multi-Asset – Seeks to generate high, uncorrelated returns that are tail-risk aware. Offers a single solution to provide diversified global emerging markets exposure to Gramercy’s existing emerging market alternative strategies across a variety of asset classes as well as direct investments in these same asset classes when that approach is deemed more appropriate. The strategy invests in liquid investments in distressed, credit, equity and special situations. Active asset allocation and risk controls are implemented by a highly experienced pan-emerging markets investment team collaborating at the portfolio level.

Czech Government Considering Options For OKD
Apr 7 16
The Czech government is considering taking over OKD, a.s., the production subsidiary of New World Resources Plc (LSE:NWR), as an option to prevent the company's collapse, ministers said. Principal creditors and owners of NWR have asked the state to help to restructure the mining group. But the government has been reluctant to provide aid to OKD whose previous owners paid out dividends, leveraged it and split off non-core assets. But it also fears that if the mining group collapses this could hurt the economy. "It would be ideal for OKD to continue operating without problems, laying off minimum number of miners and for the current owners and creditors to leave," Finance Minister Andrej Babis told reporters after a cabinet meeting that discussed the situation. He said owners could "hand over" OKD and creditors sell their debt for "minimum" amount. Other options ranged from insolvency to some form of debt reduction, he said. Industry Minister Jan Mladek said he had offered the firm's main owners and creditors, known as AHG, to sell the firm and its debt at a meeting with AHG last week, but AHG declined to quote a price it would seek. AHG includes Ashmore Investment Management Limited, Gramercy Funds Management LLC and M&G Investment Management Limited. An AHG spokesman had no response to the ministers' statements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
