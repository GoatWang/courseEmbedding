Testimonials

"Grinding stainless steel railings is not an easy task. We were using zirconia flap discs and dynafile belts to grind the welds smooth. We called the folks at Lehigh Valley Abrasives to see if they could help us cut our abrasive costs. Lehigh Valley Abrasives sent us free samples of ceramic grain flap discs and belts to test. The samples outperformed our current discs and belts by 200% and actually cost a little less than our old supplier was charging us. In the last six months we have saved $7,000. We appreciate the folks at LVA showing us a new product and saving us money which falls right down to the bottom line, more profit."  John K – Stainless Steel Railings, Whitewater WI


"We originally were skeptical that we could buy a flap disc for $1.72 and it would last as long as the $6.00 discs we were currently using. Lehigh Valley Abrasives agreed to send us some samples for free testing in our shop. They were right. Their flap discs outlasted our $6.00 discs buy 50%. We now use Lehigh Valley Abrasives exclusively and have reduced our finishing costs to 1/3 of what it used to be. Last year we saved about $12,000."  Stuart S – Ornamental Iron – Los Angeles, CA


"The BEST find on Ebay!  Superior quality product & service! Why pay upwards of $6 a wheel when you can get three?? These flap wheels stand toe to toe with any $6 disk out there!"   Ken -  Fab shop owner -- Pittsburgh, Pa.


"Abrasives make up a significant portion of our fabrication costs so we are always looking for a better product at a better price. We stumbled across Lehigh Valley Abrasives when doing a Google searchon the internet and are glad we found them. After calling LVA we ordered some flap discs, roloc discs and belts to see if their products held up given they cost about a third less than we were currently paying. We were very please with the results. For the last two years we have been ordering all our flap discs cut off wheels, roloc discs and belts from LVA. I am not sure exactly how much money we have saved, but, I know it is a lot. We are also pleased that our orders ship in a timely manner and the customer service is knowledgeable and friendly. I have recommended Lehigh Valley Abrasives to a few friends in the industry and would suggest to anyone looking for a good product at a great price to give them a try."  Steve K – Steel Fabrication – Bethlehem PA 


"I've used alot of sanding discs in my 35 years of welding and fabrication, and these products meet or excede any on the market. The quality is always consistent, and the customer service is top-notch"  Jim - custom motorcycle builder


"Until I found Chris’s company, Lehigh Valley Abrasives who now solely supply my grinding disk needs, my grinding cost and usage factors were astronomical. I mainly use 4’’  40 grit zirconia grinding discs. Since switching to LVA my cost and time factors have been greatly reduced. Because of this  I do not shudder quite as much as I used to when it is time to throw away a disc. LVA has helped me decrease my grinding time and also keep more profits within my company. I highly recommend them to all."   JPS - Metal fabrication owner - North Carolina


"They are without a doubt the best quality,fastest cutting ,longest lasting I have used in my 35 years of metal shop work... I cut mild steel here at work -sheet 18 Ga and bar stock up to 1/2" thick by 3" wide a lot. They have time and again proven their worth in saving plasma cutting expendables and Oxygen/Acetylene as well. I buy in bulk and save a little money too, so I am very happy to continue using them. Thanks for handling a great product ."  Kenny - Missouri


"I have done extensive marketing research and used the products of numerous suppliers. For price, product quality, promptness of shipping and friendly service you have no peer. Consider me a life time customer. I can not thank you enough."  John Brommel


" We can't say enough good things about the products and pricing! The cost of abrasives is one of the hardest things to keep accounted for and under control, in the metal fab industry. Dealing with Lehigh Valley Abrasives has made this much easier and worry-free, which is definitely good for business! Thank you for offering such fine products at such reasonable prices, with the quick turn-around on our orders. It really couldn't be much better! We look forward to receiving our next shipment and many more in the future. " Richard Thompson - CHR, Inc. - Springfield, Mo.

HomeOur ProductsAbout Us



About Lehigh Valley Abrasives
Lehigh Valley Abrasives has a long history of providing high quality products at value prices. The company originated in 1967 as a fabricator of stainless steel tanks, vessels, and hoppers for the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. The demand from customers for improved surface finishes drove us to delve deeply into the field of abrasives. Over time we became very knowledgeable in the field of abrasives and began to develop and manufacture flap discs, belts, and cut-off wheels that we used for our own product line.
The products we developed performed so well that we decided to offer them to the general metalworking industries. Our products are used to grind, cut, blend, and polish metal. Each of our products performs extremely well and is priced competitively. In order to hold costs down we sell direct to the end user and maintain a low overhead structure.
Our employees are customer service oriented, product knowledgeable and courteous. These qualities have allowed Lehigh Valley Abrasives to become one of the largest independent sellers of flap discs in the United States. We look forward to working in partnership with your company. Lowering both your finishing time and costs.
