CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Flagship Ventures, a leading venture capital and venture creation firm focused on innovations in healthcare and sustainability, announced it has raised $537 million for Flagship Ventures Fund V, its largest fund since its founding in 2000. The new investment brings Flagship's aggregate funds under management to $1.4 billion.
Fund V will continue Flagship's strategy of venture creation through VentureLabs™, Flagship's innovation foundry, and early-stage venture investing in therapeutics, health technologies and sustainability - specifically in the energy, water, and agriculture/nutrition sectors. 
"We closed this fund with nearly twice the amount of capital we had initially sought, and in record time," said Dr. Noubar Afeyan, senior managing partner and chief executive officer of Flagship Ventures. "The strong interest from new and existing Limited Partners is a meaningful endorsement of our unique approach."
Flagship is unique in originating and launching its own startups through VentureLabs, where it discovers and develops disruptive ideas as a foundation for first-in-class companies. Flagship Ventures also funds companies based on breakthrough science and technology originating outside the firm. Flagship's goal is to realize returns from entrepreneurial innovation by building companies based on cutting-edge technology with the potential to solve significant global problems.
Dr. Afeyan added, "With this fund, we will accelerate our process of creating companies through VentureLabs, and we anticipate expanding our team and launching as many as five new companies a year going forward."
Flagship's previous fund, Fund IV, totaled $269 million and was raised in 2010. In the past 24 months, Flagship has had eight successful initial public offerings, including Receptos (RCPT), Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals (TTPH) and Acceleron Pharma (XLRN). In addition, a number of game-changing companies have emerged from VentureLabs such as Moderna Therapeutics, which is pioneering messenger RNA Therapeutics™, and Seres Health, which is developing microbiome therapeutics. 
"Our strong track record of recent exits underscores our approach to identifying and growing companies that have the ability to bring innovative therapeutics and technologies to market," said Dr. Afeyan. "Our business model has proven resilient to changing market conditions and continues to deliver superior returns to our Limited Partners."
As part of launching the new fund, Flagship announced that Douglas Cole, M.D., has been promoted to managing partner and David Berry, M.D. Ph.D., has been promoted to general partner. Dr. Cole has led investments in Agios Pharmaceuticals, CombinatoRx (ZLCS), Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE), Editas Medicine, Receptos, Quanterix, Syros Pharmaceuticals and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Berry has led several investments and is a co-founder of portfolio companies Joule Unlimited, Eleven Biotherapeutics (EBIO), Seres Health, and Pronutria Biosciences.
"Doug and David have made significant contributions to Flagship and we are pleased to promote them within our organization," said Dr. Afeyan. "Their technical, organizational and business insights have created substantial value for our investors."
About Flagship Ventures

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Cambridge, Mass.-based Flagship Ventures has closed its new fund, Flagship Ventures Fund IV L.P., with $270 million in commitments. The firm said it exceeded a $250 million target, and saw participation from pension funds, foundations, fund-of-funds, corporations and individuals. The early-stage investment firm was formed in 2000. It’s previous fund closed in 2007 with $235 million.
PRESS RELEASE
Flagship Ventures, a leading venture capital firm focused on healthcare and sustainability, today announced the year-end 2011 close of its largest fund to date, raising $270 million for Flagship Ventures Fund IV L.P., exceeding its target of $250 million. Investors in Flagship Ventures Fund IV include pension funds, foundations, fund-of-funds, corporations and individuals. Joining prior fund investors were several new limited partners.
Flagship Ventures Fund IV builds on the early successes of the firm’s last fund, a $235 million pool launched in 2007, with a portfolio of 24 ventures that includes lead investments in Agios, Joule Unlimited, Selecta, and Accuri (acquired by Becton Dickinson in 2011). With the closing of the new fund, Flagship Ventures now has more than $900 million of early-stage capital under management.
Since its founding in 2000, Flagship Ventures has operated through two synergistic units: Flagship Venture Capital and Flagship VentureLabs. The firm has built a portfolio of over 65 venture investments of which 25 emanated from its in-house venture creation group, VentureLabs. Notable exits have included Adnexus Therapeutics, Morphotek, Hypnion, CGI, Aveo, BG Medicine, and Accuri. 





“We are quite pleased by the market’s reaction to our fourth fund,” said Noubar Afeyan, Flagship Ventures’ managing partner and chief executive officer. “Despite the difficult environment for fundraising, especially for early-stage venture firms, we received strong support from our prior investors, as well as from several new important limited partners. We believe that the firm’s investment strategy and greater than ten year history of building valuable, transformative companies are well aligned with the world’s ever increasing reliance on innovation, entrepreneurship and value creation.”
In addition to investing in early-stage companies, Flagship Ventures will dedicate a portion of Fund IV to later-stage value investing opportunities resulting from the current capital-constrained environment.
