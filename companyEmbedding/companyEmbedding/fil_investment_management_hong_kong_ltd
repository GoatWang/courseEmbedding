About us

 


Who we are
Fidelity International offers world class investment solutions and retirement expertise. As a privately owned, independent company, investment is our only business. We are driven by the needs of our clients, not by shareholders. Our vision is to deliver innovative client solutions for a better future.
Established in 1969 as the international arm of Fidelity Investments, which was founded in Boston in 1946, Fidelity International became independent of the US organisation in 1980, and is today owned mainly by management and members of the original founding family.


What we do
We invest USD $290 billion* globally on behalf of clients in 25 countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Our clients range from central banks, sovereign wealth funds, large corporates, financial institutions, insurers and wealth managers, to private individuals.
In addition to asset management, we offer investment administration and guidance for employer benefit schemes, advisers and individuals in several countries. We are responsible for USD $85 billion* in assets under administration.
* As of 30/09/2016


 

Our Investment Philosophy & Approach
Building on active, bottom-up research, we create the competitive advantage that is able to deliver superior returns for our clients.  Because markets are only semi-efficient, we act on intelligent insight:

    We have one of the largest global                research capabilities with over                400 investment professionals                around the world.       Our portfolio managers and                analysts attend more than 17,000                company meetings a year – or                one every 10 minutes on average.       We are committed to proprietary                research, with 90% of our research               produced in-house.       Our analysts carry out their                research on the ground – visiting               the shop floor, speaking to                customers, competitors, suppliers,               and independent experts to form               conviction.  
This 360⁰ perspective lets us find growth opportunities or income streams that have not been priced in by the market – allowing us to consistently add value for our clients.
 
 


How we run our business
We train many of our fund managers through our rigorous Portfolio Manager Academy programme. New portfolio managers initially manage pilot funds to test their ideas with our own money first. To our clients we offer tried and tested funds as a matter of principle.
Our portfolio managers are compensated on their long-term performance so that client and manager time horizons and interests are aligned. The same is true for our management, whose shareholdings are for the duration of their careers with the company.
Our model of private, independent ownership ensures we always act in the best interest of our clients. It provides the long-term framework enabling us to invest heavily into technology and innovation to continually improve our performance in supporting the goals of our clients.
It’s an approach that works: numerous awards around the globe recognise the consistent strong achievements of our investment and client service teams.

About us

 


Who we are
Fidelity International offers world class investment solutions and retirement expertise. As a privately owned, independent company, investment is our only business. We are driven by the needs of our clients, not by shareholders. Our vision is to deliver innovative client solutions for a better future.
Established in 1969 as the international arm of Fidelity Investments, which was founded in Boston in 1946, Fidelity International became independent of the US organisation in 1980, and is today owned mainly by management and members of the original founding family.


What we do
We invest USD $290 billion* globally on behalf of clients in 25 countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Our clients range from central banks, sovereign wealth funds, large corporates, financial institutions, insurers and wealth managers, to private individuals.
In addition to asset management, we offer investment administration and guidance for employer benefit schemes, advisers and individuals in several countries. We are responsible for USD $85 billion* in assets under administration.
* As of 30/09/2016


 

Our Investment Philosophy & Approach
Building on active, bottom-up research, we create the competitive advantage that is able to deliver superior returns for our clients.  Because markets are only semi-efficient, we act on intelligent insight:

    We have one of the largest global                research capabilities with over                400 investment professionals                around the world.       Our portfolio managers and                analysts attend more than 17,000                company meetings a year – or                one every 10 minutes on average.       We are committed to proprietary                research, with 90% of our research               produced in-house.       Our analysts carry out their                research on the ground – visiting               the shop floor, speaking to                customers, competitors, suppliers,               and independent experts to form               conviction.  
This 360⁰ perspective lets us find growth opportunities or income streams that have not been priced in by the market – allowing us to consistently add value for our clients.
 
 


How we run our business
We train many of our fund managers through our rigorous Portfolio Manager Academy programme. New portfolio managers initially manage pilot funds to test their ideas with our own money first. To our clients we offer tried and tested funds as a matter of principle.
Our portfolio managers are compensated on their long-term performance so that client and manager time horizons and interests are aligned. The same is true for our management, whose shareholdings are for the duration of their careers with the company.
Our model of private, independent ownership ensures we always act in the best interest of our clients. It provides the long-term framework enabling us to invest heavily into technology and innovation to continually improve our performance in supporting the goals of our clients.
It’s an approach that works: numerous awards around the globe recognise the consistent strong achievements of our investment and client service teams.

Fidelity International, formerly Fidelity Worldwide Investment, is a company that provides investment management services including mutual funds, pension management and fund platforms to private and institutional investors. Fidelity International was originally established in 1969 under the name Fidelity International Limited (FIL) as the international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research in Boston (see Fidelity Investments) before being spun out as an independent business in 1980. Since then, it has continued to operate as a private company owned by some of its employees and the Johnson family.

History[edit]
It was established in 1969 [1] as an international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research, before becoming an independent business in 1980. Today, Fidelity International handles investments for clients in Europe, EMEA and Asia, while the US-based Fidelity Management and Research handles investments for clients in North America.
In the same year that it was established, an office was opened in Tokyo,[2] followed by London in 1973,[3] Hong Kong in 1981[4] and Taipei in 1986. In 1990 the first Continental European office was opened in Amsterdam,[5] when a number of Luxembourg funds for Continental Europe and Asia were launched. Expansion has continued, with Fidelity opening an office in India in 2001 and in China in 2004.
In 2012, chief investment officer Dominic Rossi expressed support for a UK government plan to allow shareholders to veto bonus deals for boardroom members in companies, using what The Guardian called "unusually confrontational language for a major investor more accustomed to operating behind the scenes".[6] Rossi has since campaigned to get UK long-term incentive plans extended from three years to five.[7]
As of 2013[update], Fidelity employs over 7,000 people in 24 countries around the world;[1] Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), Dubai, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia and the UK.
The company is privately owned; the majority of the company is owned by its employees, though the Johnson family still owns a substantial minority of 39.89% according to regulatory filings.[8]
Services[edit]
Fidelity offers its own funds and, through its platforms in a number of countries, other managers’ funds. It currently manages or administers over US$300bn on behalf of private individuals and institutions around the world, offering investors the opportunity to further their medium and long-term investment goals.[9]
Depending on location, Fidelity offer a range of active asset management solutions as well as large fund platforms offering access to Fidelity and other managers’ funds and services for personal investors. Fidelity provides solutions to the ISA, SIPP and Defined Contribution Pensions markets, both for domestic schemes, multinational employers and their staff.
Fidelity International Investment has around 300 portfolio managers and research professionals globally[1]. These investment professionals carry out in-depth analysis to uncover investment opportunities, following a bottom-up stock picking approach.[10]
Awards[edit]
Fidelity has been named Fund House of the Year, DC Provider of the Year at the UK Pensions Awards, and won the Premier Group Award at the Money Investment Trust Awards.[11] [12] [13]

Fidelity International, formerly Fidelity Worldwide Investment, is a company that provides investment management services including mutual funds, pension management and fund platforms to private and institutional investors. Fidelity International was originally established in 1969 under the name Fidelity International Limited (FIL) as the international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research in Boston (see Fidelity Investments) before being spun out as an independent business in 1980. Since then, it has continued to operate as a private company owned by some of its employees and the Johnson family.

History[edit]
It was established in 1969 [1] as an international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research, before becoming an independent business in 1980. Today, Fidelity International handles investments for clients in Europe, EMEA and Asia, while the US-based Fidelity Management and Research handles investments for clients in North America.
In the same year that it was established, an office was opened in Tokyo,[2] followed by London in 1973,[3] Hong Kong in 1981[4] and Taipei in 1986. In 1990 the first Continental European office was opened in Amsterdam,[5] when a number of Luxembourg funds for Continental Europe and Asia were launched. Expansion has continued, with Fidelity opening an office in India in 2001 and in China in 2004.
In 2012, chief investment officer Dominic Rossi expressed support for a UK government plan to allow shareholders to veto bonus deals for boardroom members in companies, using what The Guardian called "unusually confrontational language for a major investor more accustomed to operating behind the scenes".[6] Rossi has since campaigned to get UK long-term incentive plans extended from three years to five.[7]
As of 2013[update], Fidelity employs over 7,000 people in 24 countries around the world;[1] Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), Dubai, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia and the UK.
The company is privately owned; the majority of the company is owned by its employees, though the Johnson family still owns a substantial minority of 39.89% according to regulatory filings.[8]
Services[edit]
Fidelity offers its own funds and, through its platforms in a number of countries, other managers’ funds. It currently manages or administers over US$300bn on behalf of private individuals and institutions around the world, offering investors the opportunity to further their medium and long-term investment goals.[9]
Depending on location, Fidelity offer a range of active asset management solutions as well as large fund platforms offering access to Fidelity and other managers’ funds and services for personal investors. Fidelity provides solutions to the ISA, SIPP and Defined Contribution Pensions markets, both for domestic schemes, multinational employers and their staff.
Fidelity International Investment has around 300 portfolio managers and research professionals globally[1]. These investment professionals carry out in-depth analysis to uncover investment opportunities, following a bottom-up stock picking approach.[10]
Awards[edit]
Fidelity has been named Fund House of the Year, DC Provider of the Year at the UK Pensions Awards, and won the Premier Group Award at the Money Investment Trust Awards.[11] [12] [13]

Fidelity International was originally established in 1969 under the name Fidelity International Limited (FIL) as the international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research in Boston (see Fidelity Investments) before being spun out as an independent business in 1980. Since then, it has continued to operate as a private company owned by some of its employees and the Johnson family.

History[edit]
It was established in 1969 [1] as an international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research, before becoming an independent business in 1980. Today, Fidelity International handles investments for clients in Europe, EMEA and Asia, while the US-based Fidelity Management and Research handles investments for clients in North America.
In the same year that it was established, an office was opened in Tokyo,[2] followed by London in 1973,[3] Hong Kong in 1981[4] and Taipei in 1986. In 1990 the first Continental European office was opened in Amsterdam,[5] when a number of Luxembourg funds for Continental Europe and Asia were launched. Expansion has continued, with Fidelity opening an office in India in 2001 and in China in 2004.
In 2012, chief investment officer Dominic Rossi expressed support for a UK government plan to allow shareholders to veto bonus deals for boardroom members in companies, using what The Guardian called "unusually confrontational language for a major investor more accustomed to operating behind the scenes".[6] Rossi has since campaigned to get UK long-term incentive plans extended from three years to five.[7]
As of 2013[update], Fidelity employs over 7,000 people in 24 countries around the world;[1] Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), Dubai, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia and the UK.
The company is privately owned; the majority of the company is owned by its employees, though the Johnson family still owns a substantial minority of 39.89% according to regulatory filings.[8]
Services[edit]
Fidelity offers its own funds and, through its platforms in a number of countries, other managers’ funds. It currently manages or administers over US$300bn on behalf of private individuals and institutions around the world, offering investors the opportunity to further their medium and long-term investment goals.[9]
Depending on location, Fidelity offer a range of active asset management solutions as well as large fund platforms offering access to Fidelity and other managers’ funds and services for personal investors. Fidelity provides solutions to the ISA, SIPP and Defined Contribution Pensions markets, both for domestic schemes, multinational employers and their staff.
Fidelity International Investment has around 300 portfolio managers and research professionals globally[1]. These investment professionals carry out in-depth analysis to uncover investment opportunities, following a bottom-up stock picking approach.[10]
Awards[edit]
Fidelity has been named Fund House of the Year, DC Provider of the Year at the UK Pensions Awards, and won the Premier Group Award at the Money Investment Trust Awards.[11] [12] [13]
