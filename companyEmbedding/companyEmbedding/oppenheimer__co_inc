NEW YORK, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. ("Oppenheimer"), a unit of Oppenheimer Holdings (NYSE:   OPY), has concluded its 17th Annual Consumer Conference in Boston. The two-day conference featured over 40 leading companies in the consumer sector, including Lowe's Companies; Home Depot; Six Flags Theme Parks; and Yum! Brands. 








The conference, which connects investors with private and publicly traded companies, provided attendees the opportunity to learn about emerging consumer trends, such as the increased importance of wellness and health. Investors were able to assess the prospect of consumer stocks for the second half of the year, which is a critically important time in retail. 
Oppenheimer Senior Research Analyst attendees, who provided insights on many aspects of the consumer sector, included:  

Anna Andreeva, Senior Analyst covering Specialty Retail 
Brian Bittner, Senior Analyst covering Restaurants 
Brian W. Nagel, Senior Analyst covering the Hardlines and Broadlines Retail sectors 
Rupesh D. Parikh, Senior Analyst covering the Food, Grocery and Consumer Products sectors 
Scott Schneeberger, Senior Analyst covering Industrial and Business Services 
Andrew Uerkwitz, Senior Analyst covering Emerging Services and Technology 
Ian A. Zaffino, Senior Analyst covering event-driven special situations

"Unprecedented changes and opportunities in consumer preferences and buying behaviors make this year's conference an important benchmark as we head into critically important times for retail – including back-to-school shopping and the holiday season," said Erica L. Moffett, Managing Director and Associate Director of Research. "As we just saw with Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, the opportunities for both private and public companies are endless. Our conference is designed to help investors stay ahead of the curve during this dynamic period by offering them both group and one-on-one meetings with the companies." 
Oppenheimer's next conferences will be the 20th Annual Conference on Technology, Internet and Communications, which will be held August 8-9 in Boston; followed by the Midwest Corporate Access Day on August 16 in Chicago. Both events will provide opportunities for investors to meet a cross section of management teams representing a wide variety of business models.
