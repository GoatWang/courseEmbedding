Tick, Tock, Says The Clock - Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Tick, Tock, Says The ClockMay.10.17 | About: Seritage Growth (SRG) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummarySears has a piggy bank called Seritage Realty Group that was formed as a REIT to allow the struggling department store company to monetize its vast real estate holdings."The '$10k' question in the eyes of most real estate investors involves the timing of the eventual Sears bankruptcy filing." - Floris van Dijkum.It certainly seems like Seritage is a time bomb. tick, tick, tick, tock, says the clock.If you decide to "roll the dice," be prepared to lose it all.According to Haley Paterson with Business Insider, "time is running out for Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD)." The business reporter recently wrote that "S&P Global Market Intelligence has identified Sears as the most vulnerable public retail company in the US, saying it has a 24% chance of default with a year." Paterson went on to explain that "this comes after Sears revealed (in April) that it has lost its second chief financial officer in six months, just as it begins talks with lender over a looming $500 million debt payment." Talk about a hot seat! Wait though, Sears has a piggy bank called Seritage Realty Group (NYSE:SRG) that was formed as a REIT to allow the struggling department store company to monetize its vast real estate holdings. If you may recall, billionaire investor Edward Lambert, the hedge fund titan, has been working feverishly to keep Sears afloat, and by selling off the pieces (Lands' End, Sears Canada, Sears Hometown, etc.), he has kept the lights on, at least for now. Seritage, formed by Lambert, was just another outlet for Sears to liquidate its real estate portfolio, essentially obtaining $2.7 billion in capital for Sears in return for a promise to pay in the form of a large-scale sale/leaseback. According to REIT analyst Floris van Dijkum with Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., "the '$10k' question in the eyes of most real estate investors involves the timing of the eventual Sears bankruptcy filing." Dijkum went on to explain: Even Sears recent SEC filing has said it may not last as a going concern, but clearly Eddie Lampert (the largest shareholder and unsecured debtholder) has defied expectations before.
 So it seems that in the game of musical chairs, the song is almost in the last stanza. The key question for Seritage Property investors is whether or not there are adequate returns to compensate investors for the outsized risk. According to Dijkum, there are "shrinking options," and he adds that "a delayed bankruptcy scenario for Sears buys Seritage time to commence as many redevelopments as possible to boost third party income," cautioning that "with approximately 30% of Seritage shares sold short, the company could have significant potential equity demand for an equity raise as hedge funds cover their short position." It certainly seems like Seritage is a time bomb... tick, tick, tick, tock, says the clock... 

 The Looming Cash Squeeze In a research report, Dijkum suggests that Seritage has a "looming cash squeeze," as the company continues to burn through its remaining cash before completing its existing recaptured Sears space. He writes: The company is in a race to hasten redevelopment of former SHLD-leased space in order to prepare for its lead tenant's widely anticipated demise. While management continues to deliver strong releasing spreads and attractive returns, we see a looming cash shortfall without a major capital raise. The recent recapture notices that top properties will require larger development capital outlays, exacerbating an imminent liquidity crunch. Did you say "liquidity crunch?" I thought Lambert and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett were funding the Seritage redevelopment story... As I wrote in a previous article, Buffett is an investor in Seritage (he also owned Tanger (NYSE:SKT) at one point of time), but he appears to be a passive investor. Lambert is kind of wearing two hats here - he's the landlord and the tenant - and he has never been a big fan of raising equity (because it dilutes his ownership stake).
 Also, according to Dijkum, "Seritage missed the opportunity to raise fresh equity at much higher levels, investors have asked what options the company has remaining to refinance either the $200 million ESL (Lambert's fund) facility that matures in December or its $1.1 billion restrictive CMBS facility that matures in July of 2019." Dijkum believes management is undoubtedly trying to obtain other debt funding, but banks and the capital markets appear closed for Sears credit. The company, however, could look to combine refinancing its stabilized assets with select asset sales to pay down its CMBS. At the end of Q1-17, Seritage's remaining unrestricted cash went from $52 million to $26.5 million during the quarter, while total outstanding debt of $1.2 billion rose by $7 million. The company has $73 million of cash available from its $100 million line, $113.9 million of restricted cash (including $11.4 million for environmental remediation) and $200 million (in staged drawdowns) from the ESL facility. According to Dijkum, the "simple math suggests approximately $423.4 million of available cash ($506 million if we include two years of estimated free cash flow of $81 million) with $394.5 million to spend on committed wholly-owned projects." 

 Dijkum points out that Seritage is also doing at least nine JV projects in its GGP JV (all 12 at roughly $110 million), while it has newly committed to at least another $62 million spend on its seven recapture boxes. He expects costs for the GGP JV and newly recaptured boxes could be significantly higher than these estimates. So, even with approximately $40 million of annual retained free cash, the REIT analyst suggests there is a "looming shortfall of over $61 million."
 Tick, tock, tick, tock, says the clock... Who Wants a Ticking Time Bomb? Mr. Market's alarm clock appears to have no alarm button. In other words, Seritage remains the only mall REIT that trades at a premium to estimated NAV and a massive NAV relative premium. 

 I just don't get it. Seritage leases a majority (~60%) of its space to a junk bond tenant, and Mr. Market thinks Seritage is a Tiffany's - Seritage trades at more than a 43% relative NAV premium to its "A" mall peers. Even more telling, Seritage reported first-quarter FFO of $0.56 per share. Overhead costs increased by $3 million compared to the previous quarter, while reimbursements declined by $1.5 million. Excluding the $6.1 million Sears lease termination payment, company FFO came in at $0.48 per share. 

 I get it, Seritage is chopping wood in an attempt to redevelop as many Sears stores before "the fat lady sings." During the quarter, the REIT signed 535,000 square feet of space at $16.41 per square foot, or 4.0 times rent multiple over previous rent. Also, Seritage generates around 12-13% returns on capital spent to redevelop Sears' recaptured space. But again, it's a game of musical chairs, and if Sears files for bankruptcy, Seritage will have to scramble to put the wheels back on the bus. As Dijkum explains: (Seritage) has insufficient third party rental income to service its debt at the time Sears files, Eddie Lampert becomes part of any debt restructuring through his unsecured loan. With approximately 30% of SRG’s shares sold short, the company could have significant potential equity demand for an equity raise as hedge funds cover their short position.
 Dijkum adds that "large shareholder Fairholme Capital has continued to add to its SRG position, having bought over 240,000 shares since ESL has distributed 2.2 million units." Tick, tock, tick, tock... Don't Be Too Cute I know you get tired of me saying, "Don't Get Too Cute," but I'm simply trying to steer investors to safety, and that means always reminding folks to protect their hard-earned principal at ALL costs. Some have criticized me for not jumping on the Washington Prime Group (NYSE:WPG) bandwagon, but given the continued volatility in the retail sector, I am just becoming a more defensive investor. Most all Retail REITs, except for SRG, are trading at deep discounts, so when the blue light specials are flashing, why not buy the best instead of the worst? As I explained, Sears' days are numbered, and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) is not too far behind. Although WPG does appear to have a well-protected dividend, a loss of rent from Sears means the landlord will also have to fund taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses. In addition, many leases have co-tenant clauses, so the loss of an anchor store could set off a chain reaction that could erode the margin of safety of the dividend. My point is, I consider SRG to be highly speculative and WPG to be speculative. If you decide to "roll the dice," be prepared to lose it all. There's a reason that Buffett owns shares in WPG... he is RICH, he can afford to take a hit. Can you? I have provided a list of Mall REITs, based on projected FFO/share data (obtained from F.A.S.T. Graphs). As you can see, SRG's forecasted growth is above average in 2018, "if the company can successfully execute on its development pipeline." However, if Sears "bites the dust," the music could end and you could be standing with no chair. Tick, tock, says the clock.

About The Project

The Mark 302 is a mixed-use redevelopment of the former Sears property in Santa Monica. Seritage Growth Properties the owner and developer, renamed the building to recognize both the iconic building’s landmark status as well as the property’s prominent location in the heart of downtown Santa Monica. With visibility and convenient access from the 10 Freeway, the property is located two blocks from the Santa Monica Pier, and directly adjacent to the terminus of the LA Metro Expo Line that runs from Downtown Los Angeles. The adaptive reuse plan contemplates lower levels that will feature unique small-shop retail and diverse food and beverage offerings, while the two upper levels will be redeveloped for flagship creative office space.
















The Neighborhood

The landmark building, located in Silicon Beach is available for lease for the first time in over half a century. The property is located two blocks from the Santa Monica Pier, and directly adjacent to the terminus of the LA Metro Expo Line that runs from Downtown Los Angeles. The Mark 302 is perfectly positioned to draw from the region's diverse and talented employee base, making it one of the most desirable locations in the country.

About
Seritage Growth Properties


Seritage Growth Properties is a publicly traded REIT primarily engaged in releasing and redeveloping its 258 property portfolio into first class multi-tenanted shopping centers. The portfolio contains over 40 million square feet of building space across 49 states and Puerto Rico. Pursuant to a master lease, 230 wholly-owned properties are leased to Sears Holdings and are operated under either the Sears or Kmart brand. 

The master lease provides Seritage with rights to recapture certain space from Sears Holdings at each property. In addition, Seritage has 50% interests in 28 additional properties through joint venture investments with General Growth Properties (9 properties), Simon Property Group (10 properties), and Macerich (9 properties) that are also master leased to Sears Holdings. 



Growth & Transformation
Seritage Growth Properties


Four new-to-market retailers made their debuts at Virginia Beach, VA at Pembroke Mall this quarter:

Nordstorm Pack
The Fresh Market
REI
DSW

The recently opened stores were a part tof a greater redevelopment of the former Sears anchor at the mall. "We are extremely pleased with the addition of Nordstrom Rack to the retail mix at our center," said Ramsay Smith, president of Pembroke Commercial Reality LLC. 

"We believe Nordstrom Rack and other retailers coming to Pembroke Mall will secure the Mall as a top destination in the market for many years to come."
The new stores each enjoyed vibrant grand openings reviving the west end of the mall. The large scale Virginia Beach project is a part of many retail redevelopments initiated by Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE: SRG).

Why The Heck Did Buffett Buy Seritage? - Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Why The Heck Did Buffett Buy Seritage?Sep. 9.16 | About: Seritage Growth (SRG) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummarySears represents one of the most storied retailers in the US.Seritage is primarily a development play.Clearly the struggling retailer has a few more levers to pull, but bankruptcy is a true option.A few days ago I wrote an article titled, Mr. Buffett, You Should Have Also Backed Up The Truck When I Did. As several readers pointed out, the title to my article was not one of the best I have produced over the years of writing on Seeking Alpha. Having written well over 1,000 articles, I hope I get a mulligan. In all fairness, my recommendation to BUY shares in Washington Prime (NYSE:WPG) was "spot on" and for those who followed my lead, they should be happy campers now. However, there was one important thing missing in the article, and I decided that instead of editing the content (and changing the title), it would be best to take a deeper dive into the content. In hindsight, I believe that if I would have included a more balanced paper, some of the more loyal Buffett fans would have been more forgiving as it relates to the title that I selected. So hopefully, the title to my article today serves a purpose - to drive page views and to clearly articulate the content that you are about to read. I am in no way trying to compare my writing with the analysis of Warren Buffett, instead, I am hoping that by the time you finish reading this article, you will give me the mulligan and gain better insight into: Why The Heck Did Warren Buffett Buy Seritage What Is Seritage? Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) is a fully integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company that is focused on the management, development, leasing, and acquisition of diversified retail real estate throughout the US. At formation on July 7, 2015, Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) completed a rights offering to help fund Seritage's $2.7 billion sale-leaseback acquisition of 235 wholly owned properties and 31 joint venture properties from SHLD. As such, SRG's largest tenants are Sears, Kmart, and Lands' End (NASDAQ:LE).
 

 The subscription price for the rights offering was set at $29.58 per share, and SRG opened at $36.02 on its first day of trading. The portfolio encompasses 42.4 million square feet of gross leasable area, and all properties are owned fee simple, with the exception of one wholly owned ground lease, one joint venture ground lease, and two joint venture leases. Upon acquisition of the wholly owned properties, 84 were operated under the Kmart brand, 140 operated under the Sears brand, and 11 were leased entirely to third parties. All joint venture properties were operated under the Sears brand. The three joint venture transactions with Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), General Growth (NYSE:GGP), and Macerich (NYSE:MAC) were completed in 1Q-15, prior to the Seritage sale-leaseback transaction. A summary of the ownership structure at the time of the rights offering is shown below: 

 How Safe Is Sears? Sears represents one of the most storied retailers in the US. Although the relevance of Sears as a retailer has faded, the company was the predominant retailer for the best part of the 20th century and amassed an immense enterprise over that time. The Sears story began in 1886 when Richard Sears started selling watches in a Minnesota train station. Mr. Sears soon after teamed up with Alvah Roebuck, a watchmaker, to publish a catalog featuring watches and jewelry. The catalog quickly expanded to include as many as 500 pages of merchandise across all retail categories, even including kits to build a home.
 The company opened its first retail store in Chicago in 1925, and sales topped $1 billion in 1945. As the preeminent retailer during the construction of many of the country's first, and best located, shopping centers, Sears is generally well positioned in prime locations, which bodes well for the real estate value of the Seritage portfolio. As Sears expanded its robust retail operations, it also invested in product development with Kenmore (1913) and Craftsman (1927), insurance with Allstate (1931), financial services with Dean Witter Reynolds (1981), Coldwell Banker (1981), and Discover (1985). As recently as 1990, Sears was the number one retailer in the US, but in the early 1990s, its retail business became a smaller part of revenues amid intensifying competition from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Kmart, and others. The company shifted its focus to its core retail business with a series of spinoffs and sales, as detailed below. In 2004, Kmart acquired Sears for $11 billion and, in 2005, Kmart and Sears merged to form Sears Holding Corporation, the third-largest US retailer at that time. Kmart shares a similar backstory to Sears as it was one of the leading retailers during the suburban big box retail revolution in the 1960s. 

 Kmart expanded rapidly through the 1990s, but succumbed to competitive pressures and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002 in the largest retailer bankruptcy in US history. As of YE15, Sears Holdings operated 941 Kmart stores and 731 Sears stores of which 97 and 322 are owned by SHLD, respectively. Following the Seritage transaction, SHLD continues to use its owned real estate as a source of liquidity amid flagging sales and may seek to monetize its Kenmore and Craftsman brands as well.
 According to RBC Capital Markets "Sears has a greater chance of survival with a smaller footprint Sears' struggles as a retailer are well documented, and we summarize below the rise and fall of this once dominant retailer." RBC explains that Sears "history includes the fact that it was early and essential in the formation of both regional malls and larger community centers. As such, the company's Sears and Kmart stores are often located on some of the best infill real estate in a given submarket. To that end, Sears has used the value of its real estate as a cash lifeline and is now using that value as a tool with Seritage to try to reshape the operating platform of the retailer." RBC suggests a more bullish view of Sears as explained below: By focusing on its core brands including Kenmore and Craftsman - both of which are highly regarded - and shrinking non-essential merchandise lines, Sears could ultimately create a stronger retail platform. Importantly, each of the assets in the Seritage portfolio has a predefined break-up plan that should provide both Seritage and Sears with a potential for value creation. RBC suggests that SRG could ultimately become the consolidator by "creating a unique opportunity to repurpose large-format retail boxes into higher uses. The Seritage structure as it currently stands is summarized below: 

 The Balance Sheet The Seritage balance sheet is well positioned to support growth. The company currently has only a single piece of debt, a $1.16 billion mortgage loan that is cross-collateralized by the company's entire property portfolio and bears interest at LIBOR+4.65%. That loan comes due in July of 2019, but is pre-payable without penalty in January of 2018. Paying off the loan today would generate ~$90 million of prepayment penalty, with that level falling ~$5 million/month through January of 2018.
 Seritage also has a $100 million future funding facility that currently carries no balance. The company does not have a line of credit nor unsecured bond ratings. RBC expects Seritage to replace the large mortgage with individual mortgages and perhaps a bond if the company becomes rated leading up to 2018. 

 Overall debt is low, with key debt metrics of 5.4x net debt/EBITDA, 2.9x fixed-charge coverage, and 26% net debt/total capitalization as of 2Q-16. Depending on the ultimate strategic design behind each redeveloped asset, the company could fund future redevelopments with either asset sales or new debt and equity. 

 The Most Compelling Catalyst Seritage is primarily a development play, and according to RBC, "the existing operating assets are sitting atop some of the best underlying land in the retail real estate world." Continued demand by retailers for space in the highest-quality mall and community centers should drive outsized cash flow growth for this company over the next 10 years. The redevelopment story is compelling at the asset level. The heart of the Seritage growth story is the company's access to a significant pipeline of redevelopments. The company has the right to require Sears to vacate ~50% of the 40 million SF of space represented by the Sears and Kmart boxes in the portfolio. RBC believes the company can build out the majority of this space over the next 10 years. According to RBC:
 The long-term portfolio development story is also appealing. The company's existing portfolio includes over 3,000 acres, or some 13 acres/box, of land. As a result, Seritage has the opportunity to reimagine its Sears and Kmart locations with an eye toward adding entertainment, residential units, office space or even hotels. RBC's 10-year timeline suggests that Seritage must redevelop some 25+ assets annually - a tall order for any regional mall company. At the same time, Seritage is making use of joint venture partners to help drive redevelopment, which could help accelerate the process. RBC has modeled the 10-year projections using the return profile that Seritage expects on the first 15 redevelopment projects. These first 15 projects represent properties from the middle of the company's portfolio. By projecting 25 projects annually over 10 years (and assuming 12% development returns on each site) RBC estimates that SRG shares could easily double in ten years. Buffett Is No Dummy Now, as I said at the outset, my previous article was not written to insult Warren Buffett fans. I recognize the long-term potential for Seritage. However, I consider the security speculative. Assume the worst bear case - that Sears goes belly up in twelve months, twenty months, or thirty-six months. As far as I'm concerned, the wager on Seritage is whether or not Sears goes BK. Clearly, the struggling retailer has a few more levers to pull, but BANKRUPTCY is a TRUE OPTION. Seritage's portfolio composition is heavily weighted towards Sears Holdings as a tenant - accounts for 89.1% of portfolio GLA and 70.7% of portfolio ABR, with an additional 3.3% of ABR coming from Lands' End, a SHLD spinoff. RBC's $72.00 forward (10-year) target for Seritage is attractive, and I'm sure Buffett understands perfectly the potential for the redevelopment pipeline. Would I consider Seritage at any price? Possibly, but I would own shares in a speculative account with the understanding that I am taking outsized risks, and that my time horizon is much longer (as compared with my investment in WPG). Currently, Seritage pays an annual common dividend of $1.00/share, which produces a yield of 2.2% (2016E FAD payout ratio is a very low 43.1), again much lower than I would want in my core durable income portfolio.
 The Bottom Line: Warren Buffett and I are different, and the most obvious being that he is an ultra-high net worth investor and I am not. The less obvious is that his time horizon is much longer and he is willing to ride out the Sears drama while waiting on Seritage to create value by leasing up vacant space at a much higher rent multiple. As always, I look forward to your comments. Also keep in mind, I will be traveling back from NYC today and will not be able to comment for at least 24 hours.

Seritage Growth Properties Class A (NYSE:SRG)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



      Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) announced today that it will 
      release its second quarter 2017 financial and operating results in a 
      press release on Thursday, August 3, 2017, after the market close.
    

About Seritage Growth Properties


      Seritage Growth Properties is a publicly-traded, self-administered and 
      self-managed retail REIT with 230 wholly-owned properties and 28 JV 
      properties totaling over 40 million square feet of space across 49 
      states and Puerto Rico. Pursuant to a master lease, a majority of the 
      Company's wholly-owned properties are leased to Sears Holdings and are 
      operated under either the Sears or Kmart brand. The master lease 
      provides the Company with the right to recapture certain space from 
      Sears Holdings at each property for retenanting or redevelopment 
      purposes. At several properties, third-party tenants under direct leases 
      occupy a portion of leasable space alongside Sears and Kmart, and a 
      number of properties are leased only to third parties. The Company also 
      owns 50% interests in 28 properties through JV investments with General 
      Growth Properties, Inc., Simon Property Group, Inc., and The Macerich 
      Company. A substantial majority of the space at the Company's JV 
      properties is also leased to Sears Holdings under master lease 
      agreements that provide for similar recapture rights as the master lease 
      governing the Company's wholly-owned properties.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



D Value | D Growth | A Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Investors Are Betting Big Against Seritage Growth Properties -- Here's Why They're Not Wrong
The real estate investment trust is inextricably tied to Sears Holdings.











                Rich Duprey
            

                (TMFCop)



            
            Jul 17, 2017 at 10:00AM
            
            





It may be guilt by association, but investors are betting big that real estate investment trust (REIT) Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) is set to fall. It has one of the largest short positions as a percentage of a stock's float of any company on the NYSE and one of the highest days to cover.
For a stock that's already fallen 15% this year and is down nearly 20% over the last 12 months, that's an awful lot of investors thinking it may fall further. But that may have more to do with the poor prospects of Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), with which it is inextricably linked.

An REIT for all the wrong reasons
The REIT was spun off from Sears in 2015 by chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert to buy the stores the retailer was shedding in an attempt to stay solvent. While it has a number of high-profile investors backing it, including Bruce Berkowitz and his Fairholme Capital Management, it also managed to raise some eyebrows when Warren Buffett disclosed he was a significant investor after acquiring an 8% stake in the REIT.
The 2-million-share stake was worth about $73 million at the time, which is a seemingly small sum for the multi-billionaire investor. It was an odd departure nonetheless, which appeared to run counter to his value investing bona fides. Even so, since the investment was disclosed in November 2015, Buffett is still presumably sitting on a 15% profit. More recent investors haven't been so lucky, and they're not likely to see luck turn their way anytime soon.
Having been seeded with several hundred stores from Sears' substantial real estate portfolio, the REIT collects rents from the retailer while it still occupies them, or from other companies if the department store chain has abandoned them. It's usually better if Sears doesn't occupy the space anymore because it can jack up the rents it charges to other retailers.
Get out and stay out!
In an investor presentation last month, Seritage noted that Sears pays deeply discounted rental rates of only $4.45 per square foot. If it can get another retailer to occupy the space instead, it's able to realize rates of anywhere from $13 to $18 per square foot.
Currently, though, Sears occupies 84% of the square footage Seritage leases, yet because its rents are so low, it accounts for only 60% of the annual rent the REIT collects. That's better than when it first started: Third party tenants only accounted for 20% of the rent. On some level, there could be the hope that Sears goes bankrupt so it can convert more real estate to profitable usage.

Image source: Getty Images.

Yet it's a double-edged sword because the state of the shopping mall is in a serious downward spiral, with real estate information firm CoStar estimating that nearly 1 billion square feet of retail space will need to be "rationalized" over the next few years. If Sears were to go under and liquidate its retail space, that would put a lot of inventory on the market all at once, which would depress pricing. And that already seems to be happening.
A year ago, Seritage reported annual rents that averaged $32.60 per square foot, but that has been halved now to just $16.41 per square foot, while the spread for the rent released from space previously occupied by Sears had narrowed from 5.7 times to 4.0 times. Dumping Sears' properties wholesale onto the market would cause rents to crash.





A downward spiral
But it's possible that could happen. Sears' financial condition continues to worsen, and it reports ever larger losses. Although Lampert has come up with a number of good ideas this year to try to salvage what's left of the retailer, it really is too little, too late.
There is also the possibility that investors were betting Sears would go bankrupt around the first week of July. Lampert had sold his stores to Seritage in July 2015, and some analysts suspected he was keeping Sears afloat simply to make it over that finish line, as he had just enough cash on hand to reach the deadline. Now that the July 8 threshold has come and gone and Sears remains operational, it's possible we'll see the short sellers cover their bets.
Considering the condition of the retailer, though, there's still good reason to believe Seritage Growth Properties' own finances won't markedly improve in the near future.

Investors Are Betting Big Against Seritage Growth Properties -- Here's Why They're Not Wrong
The real estate investment trust is inextricably tied to Sears Holdings.











                Rich Duprey
            

                (TMFCop)



            
            Jul 17, 2017 at 10:00AM
            
            





It may be guilt by association, but investors are betting big that real estate investment trust (REIT) Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) is set to fall. It has one of the largest short positions as a percentage of a stock's float of any company on the NYSE and one of the highest days to cover.
For a stock that's already fallen 15% this year and is down nearly 20% over the last 12 months, that's an awful lot of investors thinking it may fall further. But that may have more to do with the poor prospects of Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), with which it is inextricably linked.

An REIT for all the wrong reasons
The REIT was spun off from Sears in 2015 by chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert to buy the stores the retailer was shedding in an attempt to stay solvent. While it has a number of high-profile investors backing it, including Bruce Berkowitz and his Fairholme Capital Management, it also managed to raise some eyebrows when Warren Buffett disclosed he was a significant investor after acquiring an 8% stake in the REIT.
The 2-million-share stake was worth about $73 million at the time, which is a seemingly small sum for the multi-billionaire investor. It was an odd departure nonetheless, which appeared to run counter to his value investing bona fides. Even so, since the investment was disclosed in November 2015, Buffett is still presumably sitting on a 15% profit. More recent investors haven't been so lucky, and they're not likely to see luck turn their way anytime soon.
Having been seeded with several hundred stores from Sears' substantial real estate portfolio, the REIT collects rents from the retailer while it still occupies them, or from other companies if the department store chain has abandoned them. It's usually better if Sears doesn't occupy the space anymore because it can jack up the rents it charges to other retailers.
Get out and stay out!
In an investor presentation last month, Seritage noted that Sears pays deeply discounted rental rates of only $4.45 per square foot. If it can get another retailer to occupy the space instead, it's able to realize rates of anywhere from $13 to $18 per square foot.
Currently, though, Sears occupies 84% of the square footage Seritage leases, yet because its rents are so low, it accounts for only 60% of the annual rent the REIT collects. That's better than when it first started: Third party tenants only accounted for 20% of the rent. On some level, there could be the hope that Sears goes bankrupt so it can convert more real estate to profitable usage.

Image source: Getty Images.

Yet it's a double-edged sword because the state of the shopping mall is in a serious downward spiral, with real estate information firm CoStar estimating that nearly 1 billion square feet of retail space will need to be "rationalized" over the next few years. If Sears were to go under and liquidate its retail space, that would put a lot of inventory on the market all at once, which would depress pricing. And that already seems to be happening.
A year ago, Seritage reported annual rents that averaged $32.60 per square foot, but that has been halved now to just $16.41 per square foot, while the spread for the rent released from space previously occupied by Sears had narrowed from 5.7 times to 4.0 times. Dumping Sears' properties wholesale onto the market would cause rents to crash.





A downward spiral
But it's possible that could happen. Sears' financial condition continues to worsen, and it reports ever larger losses. Although Lampert has come up with a number of good ideas this year to try to salvage what's left of the retailer, it really is too little, too late.
There is also the possibility that investors were betting Sears would go bankrupt around the first week of July. Lampert had sold his stores to Seritage in July 2015, and some analysts suspected he was keeping Sears afloat simply to make it over that finish line, as he had just enough cash on hand to reach the deadline. Now that the July 8 threshold has come and gone and Sears remains operational, it's possible we'll see the short sellers cover their bets.
Considering the condition of the retailer, though, there's still good reason to believe Seritage Growth Properties' own finances won't markedly improve in the near future.
