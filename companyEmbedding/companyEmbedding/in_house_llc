1 of 22 of 2























Firehouse Products, LLC has revolutionized the ice fishing industry, with careful thought and attention going into every detail of their state-of-the art tip-ups.



From the early prototype consisting of an orange safety cone and pieces taken from other tip-ups already on the market, the Firehouse Tipup has come a long way.



The second prototype evolved from the orange cone to a more complex, collapsible frame, which solved some of the problems we were looking to address with this product, but introduced others.


After some more trial and error, we came up with a product that we truly believe will revolutionize the ice fishing industry.  This tip-up goes from functional to fully contained in one quick, easy step, allowing for safe and convenient storage.



This year we're excited to introduce our newest tip-up to our product lineup - the "R-Tec Claw".  This tip-up contains many of the same features that made our Firehouse Tip-up so popular last year, but at a more affordable price.  With it's ease of use and high quality construction, we're sure this tip-up will be a great addition to any ice fisherman's collection.

Click here for a video on how the R-Tec Claw works.

Why Activated Charcoal?
Did you know that activated charcoal offers incredible health benefits? At Buy Activated Charcoal, we sell the largest selection of activated charcoal products worldwide—products to cleanse your body, purify your home’s air and water, revive your pet, and detox your soil.
At Buy Activated Charcoal, we believe you don’t have to be wealthy to be healthy. Choose our affordable, helpful products today to see real results.

 
 

How Does Activated Charcoal Help?
Activated charcoal is different from the coal and charcoal briquettes you’re probably thinking of. Activated charcoal undergoes a specific treatment that makes it more porous and more adsorbent. This type of carbon can adsorb toxins and remove them from the air, the water, or the body.
Hospitals often use activated charcoal to treat people who have overdosed or been poisoned, and pet owners use activated charcoal for the same reason. At Buy Activated Charcoal, we offer a wide range of activated charcoal products for use in your home to purify the air and water.
Our products also beautify your skin and whiten your teeth, control odors produced by pets in the home, and enhance your garden soil. Feel free to read through our website to learn more about what activated charcoal is and what other benefits it can give you.


 

 

What Types of Products Do We Offer?
Like we said, we sell activated charcoal products for many aspects of your life, from products for fish tanks to delightful air fresheners and handmade soaps. You can buy our charcoal in bulk or select capsules, supplements, and tablets—just browse our website to find the products you want and add them to your cart.
We offer incredible deals and sales so you can always afford to stay healthy, whether at home or on the road. If you have any questions about our products, please call us at (308) 665-1566 or email customersupport@buyactivatedcharcoal.com. Purify Your World® .

I had such an amazing time hosting the Hasbro Game Night party last night! We set up a tournament-style evening and rotated so that all games were played. We had prizes for the winners and lots of food and drink to share. Thank you so much for the wonderful opportunity to host! We'll be playing the games for years to come :)
