Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Eco Science Solutions, Inc
Jul 14 17
Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP announced that it has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Eco Science Solutions, Inc. securities between December 2, 2016, and May 19, 2017, inclusive (the ‘Class Period’).
