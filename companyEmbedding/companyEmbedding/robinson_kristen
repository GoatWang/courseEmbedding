Meet the Expert: Kristen Robinson, Director of New Product Development

Meet  by Murad ContributorJuly 23, 2014October 9, 2014 



Kristen Robinson is our Director of New Product Development and has been with us here at Murad for seven years. We love her story about how she found her way to Murad (it’s all about solving a problem, combined with an extraordinary passion). And Kristen’s skincare regimen tips are absolutely priceless.
How did you become interested in Product Development?
I was motivated by my struggles with acne during my teen and young adulthood. Seeking and trying new treatments, countless trips and money spent on dermatologist visits and prescriptions, and observing what worked and didn’t work for my skin. This led me to a passion for all things skincare! Discouraged by my lack of progress at getting clear, despite the frequent dermatology visits, I began a quest to solve my own acne issues in a less traditional way. I placed a call to Murad customer care (over 15 years ago) and found immediate refuge. I was hooked! (Watch Kristen’s personal acne story video)
I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry, and after deciding not to pursue medical school, I sought a career where I could contribute to the field of dermatology without being a dermatologist. Coming from a small town, I had no idea a career in skincare product development existed, and I ended up pursuing a handful of careers: skin toxicology, marketing for a healthcare company, and even corporate event planning before finally pursuing my true passion. A long-time customer and fan of Murad, I decided to move to LA and contribute to the success of this company. Product development, specifically at Murad, allows me the opportunity to be immersed in and advance the skincare industry. I love approaching and solving skincare concerns, not only topically but internally and emotionally with Dr. Murad’s Inclusive Health philosophy at the helm of everything we create. It’s truly a career I’m incredibly passionate about… that I’m excited to dive into every day. Product development affords me the opportunity for constant learning, researching, collaboration, and is never boring!
What is your favorite/must-have Murad product and why?
This is a very tough question. Acne Treatment Concealer in Medium – amazing coverage and it treats acne bumps with a dose of salicylic acid while concealing. I use it when a pimple or two creeps up and I love the fact that it glides on without looking cakey. Clarifying Mask sops up oil and grime and makes my skin tone immediately brighter and refined. I’m also a huge fan of our Professional Enzyme Treatment when having a facial. It’s my all-time favorite to keep my skin clear and fresh looking.
How do you embrace the Murad Vision; Look, Live and Feel Better Every Day?
How do you LOOK BETTER?
I look forward to my morning and evening skincare rituals, and never skip the opportunity to cleanse, treat and moisturize my skin with my favorite Murad formulas or latest prototypes to test! I enjoy professional peels and facials from time to time too… to keep my skin glowing and in check with the expertise of an esthetician.
How do you LIVE BETTER?
One of the biggest advantages of living in California is the access to amazing fresh produce year round and the propensity for people to live young here. The weather inspires and encourages healthful activities. Swimming, hiking, volleyball, biking, and more… all feed my drive to be outside, among friends, and to stay mobile. Also, camping is amazing in California—there are hardly any bugs! My husband and I also like to garden and entertain friends and family in our backyard.
How do you FEEL BETTER?
Aside from staying active outside, I regularly attend workout classes at Yogaworks that help my body feel better; whether sculpting classes, barre, pilates or yoga, I find at least an hour a day to escape work and daily demands with a good sweat. I also adore my family; they are warm, loving and genuine people with wonderful traditions and values. I speak to my parents, brothers, nieces, aunts, uncles, and cousins almost every day. They are all East Coast based, but I find time to get back home at least three times a year for a solid dose of TLC!
What is your favorite Dr. Murad Insight?
Be imperfect. Live Longer.
If you weren’t at work, what would you be doing?
TRAVELING EUROPE or traveling anywhere, without a doubt!! Taking in the history, culture, food, excitement and adventure. Discovering, learning, meeting new people and expanding my imagination. Travel is always a stimulating breath of fresh air for me, opens new perspective and gets new neurons firing. Next to skincare, it is my biggest passion.
Have you experienced transformation (whether personal or career) while working at Murad?
Yes, I’ve experienced great growth both professionally and personally while working at Murad. I’ve learned better balance in my approach to work; staying strategic and calculated yet being less rigid and square; to take chances and be more open to creativity and risk taking, and that things cannot always be black and white. A bit of grey is OK sometimes! Also many key milestones have occurred for me while here at Murad: marriage, home ownership and now motherhood with a baby on the way this October!
Can you share a few tips to help our readers protect their skin during the summer months?
I encourage readers to transform their approach to skincare. Make it an enjoyable beautifying ritual, not a chore or a bore. Take in the refreshing aroma while cleansing, take a few extra seconds to use a massage technique during application of products, take this time to care for yourself and find products that best suit your preferences and skincare needs and you’ll reap the benefits of a proper skincare regimen.
Especially for SPF, find one that suits you. Do you like the feel of a light weight fluid (like Balancing Moisturizer SPF 15) or a more cushioning luxurious cream (Age Balancing Day Moisture SPF 30)? Do you want a matte (Oil-Control Mattifier SPF 15) or dewy finish? Find a sunscreen you love, that feels good on your skin, and one that you enjoy using so you won’t hesitate to reapply as needed and enjoy the experience of using it. One of my favorite Murad SPFs (for beach bag, sports, car and purse) is our Essential C Sun Balm SPF 35. It’s easy to use and glides on over my makeup for sun protection touch up. The investment you make now to protect your skin will pay off!
Kristen, we couldn’t have asked for a better tutorial on skincare… from one of our top-notch experts here at Murad. To all of our readers, we hope you will consider trying some of these products that Kristen recommends to transform your skincare regimen. And congrats on your upcoming bundle of joy Kristen! Thanks for sharing your story with us. You are an inspiration.

Thank you so much for sharing your story!  I too started breaking out in the seventh grade!  I ended up with cystic acne and would not want to leave the house!  I had acne all over my chest and back too!!  When I was in my early twenties and making my own money I went to a dermatologist and spent the next 13 years on antibiotics and tropicals.  I found Murad fifthteen years ago and it has been a life changer.  Friends and family have not always understood my obsession with my skin but of every one I know I was the only one to get acne. None of my three sisters have ever had even a small breakout!!  I am fifty nine now and still have breakouts but I have my Murad and I am living life without the pain that acne caused.  Thanks again for your testimony…you made my day!!

Dear Melody, I am so pleased to be able to share my story with you and others to offer any inspiration or affirmation that, yes, acne is physically and mentally consuming!  My 2 brothers had porcelain skin and my girlfriends could go days w/o washing their faces and reapply makeup as often as they desired.  It formed and fueled my desire to be in the skincare industry as a lifelong passion.  Murad products not only helped my skin but they weren’t harsh like topical prescriptions I’d tried and they smelled and felt so lovely!  Thanks for sharing your story!  I’m so glad you were able to find relief and find Murad!  Best Regards, Kristen

Allen & Associates PLC Lawyersrydesertheat ratedI had a very tough case for DUI. I called on Mr. Allen to handle the case. The staff was great and listened to my needs and side of the story. The never made any personal judgements about my case.  As we neared my court date I was nervous but Mr. Allen reassured me that everything would go very well and boy did it ever. I told my story to Mr. Allen and he found major errors and flaws from the arresting officer including a large range of the legal limit from .05 to .08. The charge was reduced to reckless driving and I did not have to spend any time in jail or have a device put on my car at any time. I was innocent and Mr. Allen proved it. I would recommend Mr. Allen and his staff ( Kourtnie) to anyone who comes up with a concern with the law that is in his scope of practice. Thanks to Mr. Allen and his staff, I can still go about my business. I have learned a valuable lesson of not ever putting myself in this position again.Be well.Adam W. Barlow Esq. - Attorney at Lawashleymeyer ratedI contacted Adam Barlow shortl...I contacted Adam Barlow shortly after breaking my foot in an accident that wasn't my fault. He responded to my information request right away. Everything was so easy and clear. I had no idea what to do in the situation I was in. I had a broken foot for almost a year and then had surgery. It was a bad experience but it turned out to be good thanks to Adam. He did all the work for me and explained everything to me in detail. I am so appreciative that I was able to have Adam help me in a tough time in my life. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an accident lawyer. Everyone in the office was also very friendly and professional. Tobin Law OfficeJaren F. ratedMr. Tobin was extremely professional and more than willing to go the extra mile.  He spent time explaining things in plain language. Most lawyers I've dealt with in the past use legal jargon that can be confusing if you're not familiar. Mr. Tobin was very friendly and felt like someone I could trust to represent my best interest, not like most lawyers that just want to bill you for hours. Thank you so much for giving me a personal experience unlike the big firms that treat you like a number! Tobin Law OfficeMike F. ratedHighly Recommended! I first contacted Mr. Tobin after receiving a referral from a friend that had a great experience. He was professional, very friendly, and really took the time to fully understand everything I was dealing with. I have worked with other firms that are so-called prominent and very expensive, and the experience I had with Tim Tobin Law was a step above the rest. I will recommend Mr. Tobin to friends and family and will gladly work with his law office again.Tobin Law OfficeEric S. ratedI would use Mr. Tobin services again if needed, he took the time to come visit and talk with me about my case when I were unable to make my way out to him, and he didn't try to charge me an arm and an leg. The prosecutors office were very gun ho on giving me the maximum charges and probably would have succeeded if it weren't for Mr. Tobin. Do I Recommend Tim Tobin As Your Attorney: YesWould I Ask For Tim Tobin Again: Hell YesRowley Chapman & Barney Ltdst.troopermichaels ratedI can't say enough how helpful...I can't say enough how helpful and understanding they are here in every way. They made sure to handle every aspect of  the case I had against an old acquaintance for due to an a share in a business, and it was all settled  so quickly and quietly that I didn't even notice when it was all over until they said so. I was very satisfied and would totally recommend them to anyone! Thank you so much for making things so easy!The Hogle FirmKaren J. ratedI hired The Hogle Firm to handle a case for me.

Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
