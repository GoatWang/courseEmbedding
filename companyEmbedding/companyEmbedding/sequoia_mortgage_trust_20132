NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-1, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-1 (SEMT 2013-1):
    

      --$151,646,000 class 1-A1 certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$217,189,000 class 2-A1 certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$151,646,000 notional class 1-AX certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$217,189,000 notional class 2-AX certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,146,000 class B-1 certificates 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,764,000 class B-2 certificates 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$4,576,000 class B-3 certificates 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$3,382,000 class B-4 certificates 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.30% 
      subordination provided by the 2.55% class B-1, 1.70% class B-2, 1.15% 
      class B-3, 0.85% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The class B-5 is not rated by Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and Christiana Trust will act as the Trustee for 
      the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made 
      to treat the trust as two real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-1 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's first 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime mortgage loans, with 79% fixed rate 
      mortgages (FRMs) and 21% five-, seven-, and 10-year hybrid adjustable 
      rate mortgages (ARMs). The loans are predominantly fully amortizing; 
      however, 5% have a 10-year interest-only (IO) period. The aggregate pool 
      included loans originated from first-time contributor EverBank (37%), 
      First Republic Bank (7%), PrimeLending (6%), Fremont Bank (6%), Flagstar 
      Bank, F.S.B. (6%) and Rockland Trust Company (5%). The remainder of the 
      mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage lending institutions, 
      each of which contributed less than 5% to the transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 511 loans with a 
      total balance of $397,881,280; an average balance of $778,633; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 67.7%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 4%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 60% and 6.6% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 769. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 94.9% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (42.9%), 
      Texas (13.2%) and Massachusetts (9.6%).
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-1'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.
    

      In addition to the information sources identified in Fitch's criteria 
      listed below, Fitch's analysis incorporated data tapes, due diligence 
      results, deal structure and legal documents from the 17g5 website

      Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-10
    





July 30, 2013 03:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-10, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-10 (SEMT 
      2013-10):
    

      --$371,622,000 class A-1 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-2 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook

      certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-7 
      exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$371,622,000 
      class A-8 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO1 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO2 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO3 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$371,622,000 
      class A-IO notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$10,217,000

      B-2 certificate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$4,608,000 class B-3 
      certificate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$3,205,000 non-offered class 
      B-4 certificate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.25% 
      subordination provided by the 2.55% class B-1, 1.70% class B-2, 1.15% 
      class B-3, 0.80% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The $4,208,564 non-offered class B-5 certificates will not be rated by 
      Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, CitiMortgage, Inc. will act as 
      the master servicer and Wilmington Trust will act as the Trustee for the 
      transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made to 
      treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-10 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's tenth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans. All of the loans 
      are fully amortizing. The aggregate pool included loans originated from 
      PrimeLending (8.5%) and WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital (7.6%). The 
      remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage 
      lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 529 loans with a 
      total balance of $400,671,564; an average balance of $757,413; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 68.1%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.9%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 45.5% and 5.0% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 775. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 95.2% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (40.9%), 
      Texas (9.4%) and Virginia (6.7%).
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists of 30-year 
      fully amortizing, fully documented FRMs to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles, low leverage, and substantial liquid reserves. Third-party 
      loan-level due diligence was conducted on 99.8% of the pool, and Fitch 
      believes the results of the review generally indicate strong 
      underwriting controls.
    

      Originators with Limited Performance History: The majority of the pool 
      was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. 
      The lack of performance history is partially mitigated by the 100% 
      third-party diligence conducted on these loans that resulted in 
      immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit enhancement (CE) on 
      this transaction sufficient to mitigate the originator risk.
    

      Geographically Diverse Pool: The collateral pool is geographically 
      diverse. The percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas 
      (MSAs) is 23.1% and concentration in California is 40.9%, similar to 
      recent SEMT transactions. The agency did not apply a default penalty to 
      the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk.
    

      Transaction Provisions Enhance Deal Framework: The representation, 
      warranty and enforcement mechanism framework is viewed positively, as it 
      is consistent with Fitch criteria. As in other recent Fitch-rated SEMT 
      transactions, SEMT 2013-10 contains binding arbitration provisions that 
      may serve to provide timely resolution to representation and warranty 
      disputes. In addition, all loans that become 120 days or more delinquent 
      will be reviewed for breaches of representations and warranties.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    

      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions, Fitch's sustainable home price (SHP) model 
      does not project declines in home prices. This region is 
      Dallas-Plano-Irving in Texas (4.3%). Fitch conducted sensitivity 
      analysis assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% compared with those 
      projected by Fitch's SHP model for this region. The sensitivity analysis 
      indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    

      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 13.7%, slightly less than the 14.5% base sMVD projected 
      in the current model.
    

      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model-projected 14.5% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-10'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
