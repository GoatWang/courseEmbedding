Body Procedures







Tummy Tuck

	Also known as abdominoplasty, a tummy tuck removes excess fat and skin, and in most cases restores weakened or separated muscles creating an abdominal profile that is smoother and firmer.
	A flat and well-toned abdomen is something many of us strive for through exercise and weight control. Sometimes these methods cannot achieve our goals.
	Even individuals of otherwise normal body weight and proportion can develop an abdomen that protrudes or is loose and sagging. The most common causes of this include:


		Pregnancy

		Aging

		Significant fluctuations in weight

		Heredity

		Prior surgery

		Abdominoplasty is a good option for you if:

		You are physically healthy and at a stable weight

		You have realistic expectations

		You do not smoke


	 










				          Pre-op Abdominoplasty

				      Post-Operative Abdominoplasty




	 












				Pre-Op Abdominoplasty

				Post-Operative Abdominoplasty

				Post-Operative Abdominoplasty




	 

	What a tummy tuck won't do:
	Tummy tucks are not a substitute for weight loss or an appropriate exercise program. Also, tummy tuck operations cannot correct stretch marks, although these may be removed or somewhat improved if they are located on the areas of excess skin that will be excised, generally the treated areas below the belly button.

	Link for more information:
http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Cosmetic-Procedures/Tummy-Tuck.html






Liposuction

	Also known as lipoplasty, liposuction slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing excess fat deposits, improving your body contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing your self-image.
	Despite good health and a reasonable level of fitness, some people may still have a body with disproportionate contours due to localized fat deposits. These areas may be due to family traits rather than a lack of weight control or fitness.  Liposuction surgery can be used to treat stubborn fat pockets in many parts of the body.  





					 Pre-Operative SAL Abdomen, Flanks & Thighs


				Post-Operative SAL Abdomen, Flanks & Thighs























				 

				 



				 

				 




	What liposuction won't do:
	Liposuction surgery is not a treatment for obesity and is not a replacement for regular exercise and good eating habits. People with stubborn areas of fat and who exercise regularly are the best candidates for this procedure.

Treatments







Sclerotherapy

	Sclerotherapy was developed over 75 years ago and at present is one of the most prevalent treatments for spider and varicose veins. During the treatment, a sclerosing agent is injected into the vein through a tiny needle. Treatments can last between 15 - 45 minutes depending on the number of veins treated in a particular session. Upon injection the solution replaces the blood in the vein generating irritation and corrosion to the wall of the vessel. The body then initiates the natural healing process and the vein begins to decompose, shrink and eventually disappear.






Micronutrient Therapy

	Doctor Thomas has brought in a nutritional supplement treatment called Intravenous Micronutrient Therapy (IVMT). IVMT has been used for more than 30 years for the treatment of a wide range of clinical conditions. It is a combination of vitamins and minerals that are given to boost the immune system, improve energy capacity and cell function. Conditions that may be improved with IVMT are as follows:


		Fatigue

		Depression

		Allergies

		Migraines

		Asthma

		Chronic Pain

		Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

		Fibromyalgia

		Pre & Post Surgery to Minimize Fatigue







Microdermabrasion

What does the treatment include?

	Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive, safe deep exfoliation of the skin. The treatment uses a hand piece that allows aluminum oxide crystals to gently abrade the skins surface. It then vacuums the crystals, along with dead or damaged skin cells, away. This vacuuming stimulates the collagen beneath the surface of the skin and helps create better skin tone.

What are the benefits of the treatment?

	Microdermabrasion results in an overall smoother skin surface, more uniform texture and coloration. It helps diminish larger pores and improves acne conditions. It helps polish dull skin tone and softens fine lines.

How often can I have Microdermabrasion treatments?

	Treatments can be performed as often an once a week. Your Medical Skin Care Specialist will help you evaluate the intervals of treatment based on your individual skin conditions.

Injectables







Juvederm XC

Juvederm XC
	All youthful smooth skin contains an abundance of a naturally hydrating substance called hyaluronic acid (HA) to keep the skin smooth and supple. But as you age, time, sunlight, and other factors can reduce the amount of HA in your skin. The lack of HA causes your skin to lose structure and volume – creating facial wrinkles and folds around your nose and mouth. Juvéderm XC helps replace the HA your skin has lost, adding volume to smooth away facial wrinkles and folds. The filler is injected just below the skins surface to temporarily fill moderate to severe wrinkles.






Botox

BOTOX® Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles to temporarily treat moderate to severe frown lines between the brows and forehead. BOTOX® Cosmetic works by blocking nerve impulses to the injected muscles. This reduces muscle activity that causes those lines to form. With less movement the skin surface gradually smoothes out and lines begin to fade.


		Botox is a simple 10 minute procedure

		No anesthesia is required

		You may experience minimal, brief discomfort

		There may be some slight temporary bruising at the injection site

		You will typically see improvement within the first week following your treatment.


	For a complementary consultation regarding Botox or any of our other facial treatments, please feel free to contact us.
