(OSG) downsized its IT division to conserve its business resources. As of January 2013 there is a spending freeze for all departments at the company.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The pools collect revenue from customers, pay voyage-related expenses, and distribute TCE revenues to the participants, after deducting administrative fees, according to formulas based upon the relative carrying capacity, speed, and fuel consumption of each vessel. As of December 31, 2010, Tankers International had seven participants and managed a fleet of 45 modern VLCCs and ULCCs that trade throughout the world, including all 15 of the Company’s ULCC and VLCC owned and chartered-in vessels.

As of December 31, 2010, there were 13 participants in Aframax International and the pool Commercially Managed 46 vessels, including 11 (10.5 weighted by ownership) of the Company’s owned and chartered-in vessels. Aframax International’s vessels generally trade in the Atlantic Basin, North Sea and the Mediterranean. As of December 31, 2010, Panamax International managed a fleet of 24 modern Panamaxes, which includes five of the Company’s owned crude Panamaxes and three of its owned Panamax Product Carriers (LR1s), as well as three crude Panamaxes that are time chartered to one of the pool partners.
U.S. flag fleet operations[edit]
OSG is a commercial owners and operators of Jones Act vessels. The Company’s U.S. Flag Fleet consists of 25 owned, operated and newbuild Handysize Product Carriers and ATBs. The acquisition of Maritrans Inc., gave OSG a presence in all United States trading routes, such as intra United States Gulf, United States Gulf to the East Coast, United States Gulf to the West Coast, the Alaskan North Slope trades and the Delaware Bay. The Company has extension options for the lives of the chartered-in vessels. As of December 31, 2010, OSG has time charters-out for 11 of these 12 vessels. OSG has a presence in the Alaskan North Slope trade through its 37.5% equity interest in Alaska Tanker Company, LLC (ATC), a joint venture that was formed among OSG, BP plc. (BP) and Keystone Shipping Company (Keystone) to support BP’s Alaskan crude oil transportation requirements. Certain of the Company’s vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program (the Program), which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the United States Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency.

International fleet operations[edit]
OSG’s crude oil fleet includes all major crude oil vessel classes, including a fleet of six International Flag lightering vessels that trade primarily in the United States, Gulf of Mexico. In order to enhance vessel utilization and TCE revenues, the Company has placed its ULCC, VLCC, Suexmax, Aframax tankers as well as a number of Panamax tankers into Commercial Pools that are responsible for the Commercial Management of these vessels. The pools collect revenue from customers, pay voyage-related expenses, and distribute TCE revenues to the participants, after deducting administrative fees, according to formulas based upon the relative carrying capacity, speed, and fuel consumption of each vessel. As of December 31, 2010, Tankers International had seven participants and managed a fleet of 45 modern VLCCs and ULCCs that trade throughout the world, including all 15 of the Company’s ULCC and VLCC owned and chartered-in vessels. Suezmax International is managed by the Company. As of December 31, 2010, the pool had two participants and provides the Commercial Management for a fleet of four vessels, including the Company’s two chartered-in vessels, which primarily trade in the Atlantic Basin. As of December 31, 2010, there were 13 participants in Aframax International and the pool Commercially Managed 46 vessels, including 11 (10.5 weighted by ownership) of the Company’s owned and chartered-in vessels. Aframax International’s vessels generally trade in the Atlantic Basin, North Sea and the Mediterranean. As of December 31, 2010, Panamax International managed a fleet of 24 modern Panamaxes, which includes five of the Company’s owned crude Panamaxes and three of its owned Panamax Product Carriers (LR1s), as well as three crude Panamaxes that are time chartered to one of the pool partners.
U.S. flag fleet operations[edit]
OSG is a commercial owners and operators of Jones Act vessels. The Company’s U.S. Flag Fleet consists of 25 owned, operated and newbuild Handysize Product Carriers and ATBs. The acquisition of Maritrans Inc., gave OSG a presence in all United States trading routes, such as intra United States Gulf, United States Gulf to the East Coast, United States Gulf to the West Coast, the Alaskan North Slope trades and the Delaware Bay. The Company has extension options for the lives of the chartered-in vessels. As of December 31, 2010, OSG has time charters-out for 11 of these 12 vessels. OSG has a presence in the Alaskan North Slope trade through its 37.5% equity interest in Alaska Tanker Company, LLC (ATC), a joint venture that was formed among OSG, BP plc. (BP) and Keystone Shipping Company (Keystone) to support BP’s Alaskan crude oil transportation requirements. Certain of the Company’s vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program (the Program), which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the United States Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
