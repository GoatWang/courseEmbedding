	Millennium CarbonUltracapacitor










Activated carbon is a primary component in ultracapacitors, an emerging alternative to traditional battery technologies. Ultracapacitors are synonymous with supercapacitors and electric double-layer capacitors ("EDLC"). Activated carbon ultracapacitors offer faster charging and discharging of power, better cycle life, and greater reliability than traditional batteries.   Ultracapacitors have two metal plate electrodes coated with activated carbon. Virtually all ultracapacitor manufacturers use activated carbon which must have a particularly high porosity and a low level of impurities such as that manufactured by Millennium Carbon. These plates are immersed in an electrolyte solution. One carbon-coated electrode is positive, and the other is negative. When a voltage is applied across the electrodes, a charge separation builds as positive and negative ions from the electrolyte accumulate on the surface of each carbon-coated plate. This charge separation creates a useful electric field between the electrodes. Due to their many benefits, ultracapacitors are currently being utilized in thousands of applications, and the market for ultra capacitors continues to accelerate. 
 
"Ultracapacitors have much lower energy density than batteries, and their low energy density is in most cases the factor that determines the feasibility of their use in a particular high power application."- Professor Andrew Burke, University of California Davis**Professor Burke does not endorse nor support this company, our product, or our statements throughout.

Millennium Carbon












	Millennium Carbonproduction PROCESS










Millennium Carbon is a manufacturer of premium Activated Carbon from macadamia nutshell feedstock. Millennium Carbon has a proprietary two-stage process based on pyrolysis and steam activation. The central element of Millennium Carbon's technology is pyrolysis, a thermal process by which hydrocarbon materials are depolymerized in an oxygen-free environment. Millennium Carbon receives the macadamia nutshells, screens the feedstock to eliminate unwanted debris, and crushes the shells to increase surface area. Our specially-designed pyrolysis char reactor carbonizes the macadamia nutshells by heating the feedstock to approximately 700C in an inert atmosphere. The pyrolysis process breaks the chemical bonds within the macadamia nutshells liberating a stream of pure carbon char material and a high temperature hydrocarbon gas. The hydrocarbon gas is then cooled and filtered into usable energy in the form of condensed oil and non-condensed gases. These energy streams produce power onsite to operate the facility through a 2-Megawatt steam turbine.As a second stage of the production process, the char moves through a rotary activation kiln in which the char is heated in the absence of oxygen, and carbon is activated through a controlled mixing of the material with superheated steam. The chemical reaction between the carbon and steam creates a highly porous carbon structure by removing carbon and impurities from lattice structure of the carbon material. As a final step, the activated carbon is acid washed and pulverized to meet to meet the specifications for high-quality powdered activated carbon for our customers.Our existing plant and primary technology research and development center is located near the port of Kawaihae on Hawaii Island. The plant is fully permitted and the first of its kind in the United States. The plant sits on a total of 13 acres of land and is designed to process approximately 12,000 tons of macadamia nutshells annually into our premium Activated Carbon.
 
"The Hawaii Island Economic Development Board is pleased to welcome Millennium Carbon to our community. The company’s innovative production process creates value from the waste stream of macadamia nutshells produced in Hawaii in an environmentally-friendly way. Millennium Carbon is working with government and private sector organizations to create new jobs and opportunities for Hawaii residents. We are glad to have Millennium Carbon in Kawaihae, Hawaii."  - Jacqui Hoover - Executive Director - Hawaii Island Economic Development Board

	Millennium CarbonANG Storage










Millennium Carbon produces a premium activated carbon that is an ideal adsorbent material for adsorbed natural gas (ANG) and low pressure compressed natural gas (CNG) storage applications.Today's conventional approaches to natural gas storage are compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid natural gas (LNG) but both have drawbacks - high costs, low storage efficiency and safety concerns. ANG storage using activated carbon is a favored alternative to these two storage methods. ANG storage provides better storage characteristics than high-pressure CNG storage because it is safer and far more efficient than CNG (500 PSI versus 3500 PSI). Ultra-high surface area activated carbon stores natural gas storage systems at pressures substantially below those typically required for current CNG systems and without the liquefaction and boil-off challenges of LNG.
 
"Adsorbed natural gas is considered to be a better choice for vehicles than compressed natural gas because the adsorption system has the advantage of low storage pressure."-Professor Shuji Himeno, Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan**Professor Himeno does not endorse nor support this company, our product, or our statements throughout.

Millennium Carbon












	Millennium CarbonPremium Activated Carbon





Activated carbon is a carbonaceous, highly porous adsorptive medium. Its complex network of pores are created within a rigid skeleton of disordered, stacked layers of carbon atoms linked together by chemical bonds. The intrinsic pore lattice structure allows for the removal of impurities from gaseous and liquid media through a mechanism referred to as adsorption. In adsorption, atoms, ions, or molecules contained in a medium are attracted to and bound to the surface of the activated carbon's internal pores by way of Van Der Waals Forces in physical adsorption or actual chemical bonds in chemisorption. Our premium Activated Carbon has a uniquely large surface area affording exceptional adsorption capabilities.  Millennium Carbon's premium Activated Carbon is manufactured from macadamia nutshells known for unique hardness and properties that produce extremely high quality Activated Carbon with greater surface area. The shells are crushed, sized, and processed by steam activation into our premium activated carbon. We have the capability to produce powdered, granular, and extruded activated carbons to serve a variety of applications including in ultracapacitors, ANG storage, and medicine and therapeutics.

			David H. Lesser has over 30 years of experience in real estate, including substantial experience creating shareholder value in REITs. Mr. Lesser is currently, and has been for more than the past 15 years, President of Hudson Bay Partners, LP ("HBP"), an investment firm focused on real estate, real estate-related situations and alternative energy. Since October 2013, Mr. Lesser has served as Chairman and CEO of Millennium Investment and Acquisition Company (ticker: SMCG). Mr. Lesser is co-founder and CEO of IntelliStay Hospitality Management, LLC which is sponsoring investments in hotels. Mr. Lesser has previously held leadership roles with public REITs, having served as a Senior Vice President of Crescent Real Estate Equities and as a Director of Keystone Property Trust. Prior to his time at Crescent, Mr. Lesser was a Director of Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch & Co. within the real estate finance group.

Since 1995, Mr. Lesser has, through HBP, invested in numerous real estate and alternative energy transactions, including a reverse merger transaction in 1997 that led to the formation of Keystone Property Trust (NYSE: KTR) ("Keystone"). Mr. Lesser, as president of HBP, led an investor group and structured a reverse merger transaction with American Real Estate Investment Corporation (AMEX: REA) to ultimately form Keystone. The transaction involved an investment of $30 million of cash, the merger of a property management company and the acquisition of a family-owned portfolio of industrial properties for ownership in the REIT. In addition to initial structuring and equity investment by HBP, Mr. Lesser served on Keystone's board of trustees until June 2000. Keystone was acquired by Prologis (NYSE: PLD) in 2004 for a total enterprise value of $1.4 billion, delivering a compound annual shareholder return of 16.5% from the initial transaction. 

HBP currently owns Intelligen Power Systems, LLC ("IPS") which is an alternative energy business focused on the manufacturing of cogeneration equipment and the development of distributed energy related to cogeneration, wind, solar and biofuel. HBP acquired IPS through the bankruptcy reorganization of California-based Coast Intelligen ("Coast"), which was acquired as a portfolio company by an affiliate of Mr. Lesser's in 2001. As a consequence of misdeeds by Coast's former owners and management team, which did not involve Mr. Lesser, Coast was reorganized through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the ultimate result of which was (i) Coast winding down its operations; and (ii) IPS, which was a subsidiary of Coast, successfully emerging from the reorganization. IPS continues to operate today with a refocused business plan providing cogeneration and other energy solutions to owners of real estate properties. 

Mr. Lesser holds an M.B.A. from Cornell University and a B.S. in Applied Management and Economics from Cornell University.

Mr. Lesser has been Chairman of Power REIT's Board of Trustees, our Chief Executive Officer since December 2011 and our Secretary and Treasurer since February 2014. Mr. Lesser has been a trustee of Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railroad, a wholly owned subsidiary of Power REIT ("P&WV"), from 2009 to the present, Chairman of P&WV's Board of Trustees from December 2010 to the present and CEO of P&WV from February 2011 to the present.
