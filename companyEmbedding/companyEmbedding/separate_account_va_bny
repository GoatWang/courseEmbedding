What is a 'Separate Account'
A separate account is a privately managed investment account opened through a brokerage or financial advisor that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. 2. In the context of variable annuities, these are payments made to an insurance company for the purpose of investing in securities. These securities are kept separate from the insurer's general investments. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Separate Account'
1. This differs from a mutual fund because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most separate accounts require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

Follow us on Twitter @BNYMellon or visit our newsroom at www.bnymellon.com/newsroom for the latest company news.About Capital GroupSince 1931, Capital Group, home of the American Funds, has been singularly focused on delivering superior results1 for long-term investors using high-conviction portfolios, rigorous research and individual accountability. Today, Capital Group manages more than US$1.4 trillion in equity and fixed income assets for millions of individual and institutional investors around the world.2The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups. These groups make investment and proxy voting decisions independently. Fixed income investment professionals provide fixed income research and investment management across the Capital organization; however, for securities with equity characteristics, they act solely on behalf of one of the three equity investment groups.1 Equity funds have beaten their Lipper peer indexes in 93% of 10-year periods and 98% of 20-year periods. Fixed income funds have beaten their Lipper indexes in 80% of 10-year periods and 80% of 20-year periods. Based on Class F-2 share results for rolling periods through December 31, 2016. Periods covered are the shorter of the fund's lifetime or since the comparable Lipper index inception date (except Capital Income Builder and SMALLCAP World Fund, for which the Lipper average was used). Expenses differ for each share class, so results will vary. Class F-2 shares were first offered on August 1, 2008. Class F-2 share results prior to the date of first sale are hypothetical based on Class A share results without a sales charge, adjusted for typical estimated expenses. Results for certain funds with an inception date after August 1, 2008, also include hypothetical returns because those funds' Class F-2 shares sold after the funds' date of first offering. Please see americanfunds.com for more information on specific expense adjustments and the actual dates of first sale.2 As of December 31, 2016The 2017 Lipper Fund Awards were awarded on March 23, 2017. Fund awards were based on risk-adjusted returns as of November 30, 2016.Sanuber Grohe+1 201 413 2247  sanuberbilguvar.grohe@pershing.com To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bny-mellons-lockwood-launches-new-investment-solution-with-american-funds-at-the-core-300473475.html©2017 PR Newswire.

TRANSAMERICA RETIREMENT INCOME PLUSSM
 Issued by 
TRANSAMERICA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT VA B 
TRANSAMERICA FINANCIAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT VA BNY 
Supplement Dated March 17, 2014 
to the  Prospectus dated
May 1, 2013  The following hereby amends, and to the extent inconsistent replaces, the corresponding paragraph in the Living Benefit
– Base Benefit section in the prospectus:  Under this benefit, you can receive up to the benefit withdrawal amount each benefit year
(first as withdrawals from your policy value and, if necessary because your policy value goes to zero by other than an excess withdrawal, as payments from us for life), starting with the benefit year immediately following the annuitant’s (or
the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) birthday after which the withdrawal percentage is no longer zero and lasting until the annuitant’s (or surviving spouse’s if the joint life option is elected)
death (unless your withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of an “excess withdrawal”; see Withdrawal Base Adjustments, below). A benefit year begins on the benefit date and thereafter on each anniversary of that date. The
withdrawal percentage and growth percentage that are used to determine your benefit withdrawal amount will be disclosed in a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement.

The following hereby amends, and to the extent inconsistent replaces, the corresponding paragraph in the Living Benefit – Base Benefit –
Withdrawal Percentage section in the prospectus:  Withdrawal Percentage. We use the withdrawal percentage to calculate the benefit
withdrawal amount. The withdrawal percentage is determined by the annuitant’s age (or the annuitant’s spouse’s age if younger and the joint life option is elected) at the time of the first withdrawal taken on or after the benefit
anniversary immediately following the annuitant’s (or the annuitant’s spouse’s if younger and the joint life option is elected) birthday after which the withdrawal percentage is no longer zero. 
As noted above, the withdrawal percentage is disclosed in Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplements. In order to receive the applicable withdrawal percentage:
(1) your application must be signed within the stated time period during which such withdrawal percentages are applicable and (2) your application must be received and your policy must be funded within the time periods set forth in the
applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. Withdrawal percentages reflected in a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement with an effective period that does not include the date you signed your application will not apply to your policy. You should not
purchase this policy without first obtaining the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. You can contact us to receive a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement applicable to you. For policies issued prior to March 17, 2014, the applicable
withdrawal percentages are set forth in the May 1, 2013 prospectus.  Please note, once established, the withdrawal percentage will not generally
increase even though the annuitant’s age increases except in certain instances involving automatic step-ups. See Living Benefit – Base Benefit – Automatic Step-Up for more information regarding automatic
step-ups.  The following hereby amends, and to the extent inconsistent replaces, the corresponding paragraph in the Living Benefit – Base
Benefit – Growth Percentage section in the prospectus:  Growth Percentage. On each of the first ten benefit anniversaries, we will
apply a growth percentage to your withdrawal base if no withdrawal occurred during the preceding benefit year. The amount added to your withdrawal base is equal to the growth percentage multiplied by the withdrawal base immediately before the
benefit anniversary.
 As noted above, the growth percentage is disclosed in Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplements. In order to receive the applicable
growth percentage: (1) your application must be signed within the stated time period during which such growth percentages are applicable and (2) your application must be received and your policy must be funded within the time periods set
forth in the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. Growth percentages reflected in a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement with an effective period that does not include the date you signed your application will not apply to your policy. You
should not purchase this policy without first obtaining the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. You can contact us to receive a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement applicable to you. For policies issued prior to March 17, 2014, the
applicable growth percentage is set forth in the May 1, 2013 prospectus. 


TRANSAMERICA RETIREMENT INCOME PLUSSM
 Issued by 
TRANSAMERICA FINANCIAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY - SEPARATE ACCOUNT VA BNY 
Supplement dated March 17, 2014 
to the  Prospectus dated
May 1, 2013  This Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement (this “supplement”) should be read and retained with the prospectus for the
Transamerica Retirement Income PlusSM variable annuity. If you would like another copy of the current prospectus, please call us at (800) 525-6205.
 We are issuing this supplement to provide the growth percentage and withdrawal percentages that we are currently offering. This supplement replaces and
supersedes any previously issued Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement(s), and must be used in conjunction with an effective Transamerica Retirement Income PlusSM variable annuity prospectus.

The rates below apply for applications signed between March 17, 2014 and June 30, 2014. The growth percentage and withdrawal percentages may
be different than those listed below for applications signed after June 30, 2014. It is also possible for a new Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement to be filed prior to June 30, 2014, which would supersede this supplement. Please work with
your financial professional or visit www.transamericaannuities.com to confirm the current rates.  GROWTH PERCENTAGE

spouse’s if younger and the joint life option is elected) 65th birthday.  Please note: In order for you to receive the growth percentage and
withdrawal percentages reflected above, your application must be signed within the time period disclosed above or earlier if a new Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement is filed prior to the end of the period discussed above since that new Rate Sheet
Prospectus Supplement would supersede this supplement. We must also receive your completed application within 7 calendar days from the date that this supplement is no longer effective, and the policy must be funded within 60 calendar days from the
date that this supplement is no longer effective. If these conditions are not met, your application will be considered not in good order. If you decide to proceed with the purchase of the policy, additional paperwork may be required to issue the
policy with the applicable rates in effect at that time.
 Please keep this Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement for future reference.

Item 27.
Number of Contract Owners  As of
January 31, 2014, there were 17 Contract owners.   


Item 28.
Indemnification  The New York Code
(Sections 721 et. seq.) provides for permissive indemnification in certain situations, mandatory indemnification in other situations, and prohibits indemnification in certain situations. The Code also specifies producers for determining when
indemnification payments can be made.  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may
be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Depositor has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered), the Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
