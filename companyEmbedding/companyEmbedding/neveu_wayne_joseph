Bar Codes Tell Where Products are Made
The first three digits on a bar code tells where the product was made
Did you ever wonder where a product was made.  Well, if you can understand and read a bar code, which is listed on all products, you can tell what country produced that product.
Can you differentiate which one is made in Taiwan or China ?
If the first 3 digits of the barcode are 690, 691 or 692, the product is MADE IN CHINA.
 
471 is Made in Taiwan . 
   
This is our right to know, but the government and related departments never educate the public, therefore we have to RESCUE ourselves.690-692  then it is MADE IN CHINA .
00 – 09   USA & CANADA
30 – 37   FRANCE
40 – 44   GERMANY
47 … Taiwan
49  JAPAN
50   UK

Nowadays,  Chinese businessmen know that consumers do not prefer products “MADE IN CHINA “, so they don’t show from which country it is made.   
However, you may now refer to the barcode, remember if the first 3 digits are:

I’m not too sure if this is correct. I just bought a new pack of Christmas lights that plainly say MADE IN CHINA but the bar code starts with 021… ? Am I missing something?

This is a really interesting point, very useful for when companies don’t put where its made on the products. I have a pair of Sennheiser headphones that are stated as Made In China but ‘Designed and Engineered in Denmark’. The bar code under the heading ‘EAN’ starts 404 which would suggest Germany. Also there is a second barcode under the title ‘UPC’ that starts 615. So perhaps 615 is some other part of China.

All Slim-Fast Canned Products Being Recalled « Wayne Joseph’s Blog

All Slim-Fast Canned Products Being Recalled
Slim Fast multi-million dollar mistake
All Slim-Fast ready-to-drink canned products are being recalled because of possible contamination with Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that may cause diarrhea and possibly nausea and/or vomiting.
Unilever United States, Inc. issued the voluntary recall in cooperation with the FDA.
“The probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote,” states a Unilever news release. Unilever says it issued the recall “out of an abundance of caution” based on its quality testing of Slim-Fast ready-to-drink (RTD) products in cans.
The recall involves all ready-to-drink Slim-Fast products sold in cans, regardless of flavor, “Best-By” date, lot code, or UPC number.
The recall doesn’t include any other Slim-Fast products, such as powdered shakes, meal bars, or snack bars.
The recalled cans are sold individually or packaged in paperboard cartons containing four, six, or 12 steel cans that are marked “11 FL OZ (325 mL)” each.
Unilever urges people to immediately discard Slim-Fast ready-to-drink products in cans and call the company at 800-896-9479 for a full refund. Unilever’s Consumer Services Center is open Monday-Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time. A recorded message is available around the clock, every day.
Unilever states that it “is in the process of identifying and correcting the production issue, and will resume production and shipping of the product when the issue has been addressed and corrected.”

Job Details
               Foley & Judell, L. L. P., ("Foley & Judell") is a nationally recognized firm of bond attorneys whose practice is devoted solely to public finance. The firm operates as a partnership which consists of nine partners (One of whom is "Special Counsel"), one attorney who is an associate, one attorneys who is "of counsel", plus an additional twenty-one persons who serve in paralegal, secre­tarial and administrative positions. Except for various changes in name and personnel, Foley & Judell has been in continuous operation since 1919 and maintains offices in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Foley & Judell is one of the largest nationally recognized law firms in the United States whose practice is exclusively in the field of public finance. Unlike multipurpose law firms, the singular focus of Foley & Judell is in those areas of state and federal law that pertain to public bond financing. This assures that the lawyers within the firm have the specialized knowledge to render comprehensive services to its extensive client base consisting of a substantial number of Louisiana's state agencies, municipalities, parishes, school boards and special commissions, boards and districts. In addition to providing bond counsel services for innumerable Louisiana projects, the firm's attorneys have drafted legislation for many bond financing programs and for the creation of special districts, boards, commissions and other local authorities. The broad experience and qualifications of the firm's personnel in the field of public finance exceed that of any similar Louisiana firm and are considered to be equal or superior to that of any firm in the country. The excellent reputation enjoyed by Foley & Judell in financial circles throughout Louisiana, the United States and with foreign and international banks, attests to the legal ability displayed by Foley & Judell in the many bond issues which the firm has handled during its 96-year history. The firm and its members possess an in-depth knowledge of Louisiana law and experience in all types of bond financing permitted under it. The depth of such knowledge and experience is indicated not only by the number of bond transactions completed by the firm but also by the variety and complexity of the transactions in which the firm has participated. Also, and more importantly, the firm and its lawyers meet the objective normally sought by an issuer in retaining bond counsel; namely, that a bond counsel firm commands respect among investment bankers and investors for high quality performance and integrity and that the public finance community has confidence in its abilities.
