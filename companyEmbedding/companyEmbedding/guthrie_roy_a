La-Z-Boy Seattle Invites you to Meet “The Makers” of La-Z-Boy: Roy Guthrie



Roy Guthrie is a New Product Launch Coordinator for La-Z-Boy. In his “The Makers” video he shares his view on his coaching style. “I try to be passionate,” Guthrie says, “and to lead, to teach, and to give back.”
“When we have someone struggling we mentor them, encourage them, keep lifting them up…and when you see it all come together, that’s what it’s about!”
“Hand craftsmanship is very important” Guthrie continues. “Quality depends on the team members building this product….You got to think of it this way: ‘When I build this piece of furniture am I building it for myself? Would I want it in my household?’”
Guthrie says that at the end of the day it’s about being a passionate team dedicated to satisfying La-Z-Boy customers.
