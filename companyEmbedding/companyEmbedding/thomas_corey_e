Home › Management & StrategyRapid7 Appoints Corey Thomas As CEO



By Mike Lennon on October 26, 2012 






Tweet











Rapid7, the Boston-based security firm behind the popular Metasploit and Nexpose testing frameworks, today announced tha Mike Tuchen has stepped down from his role as CEO and will be replaced by Corey Thomas who will serve as President and CEO of the company.
Thomas is not a new face to the company, as he has been with Rapid7 since 2008 and most recently served as president and COO. Tuchen had led the company since 2009.
Thomas led the acquisition of the open source Metasploit project and has played a key role in driving the company’s international expansion, opening offices in Australia, Hong Kong and the Netherlands, the company said.
In addition to announcing the appointment of Thomas as CEO, the company also touted that it has experienced its fourteenth consecutive quarter of record revenue, with third quarter revenue growth of 75% over the same period last year.
In November 2011, the company announced a massive $50 Million round of funding that it has used to fuel its rapid expansion. Earlier this month the company acquired Seattle-based Mobilisafe to add mobile security offerings to its security product portfolio.
"Rapid7 has experienced incredible growth to date and I'm honored to be leading our fantastic team into the next phase of opportunity," Thomas said.
"I'm thrilled to have had an opportunity to work with Corey and the team at Rapid7, and am looking forward to our ongoing relationship. We've built a phenomenal team together and earned a leadership position in the market with a bright future of continued growth and success," Tuchen said in a statement.
Prior to joining Rapid7, Thomas served as vice president at Parallels, and has held a number of positions in the Microsoft Server and Tools division. Earlier is his career he was a Consultant at Deloitte. He holds a B.E. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Vanderbilt University and a Masters of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.
The company said that Tuchen will continue to be involved in an advisory role to the Company.

                    MA —
                    October 26, 2012
                
Rapid7, a leading provider of IT security risk management software, today announced its fourteenth consecutive quarter of record revenue, with third quarter revenue growth of 75% over the same period last year. The Company continued its global expansion with the opening of its new EMEA headquarters and key staff appointments in the Netherlands.

More recently, Corey has driven international expansion, opening offices in Australia, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. During this time, former CEO Mike Tuchen has worked closely with Corey to groom him to take the helm of Rapid7 leadership.
"Rapid7 has experienced incredible growth to date and I'm honored to be leading our fantastic team into the next phase of opportunity," said Corey Thomas, President and CEO of Rapid7. “Our team's focus is on delivering an exceptional customer experience, and simple, innovative solutions that help organizations address the complex security challenges they face daily.”
Corey takes over from Mike Tuchen, who has led Rapid7 since 2009. During this time, Mike has driven the company to a market-leading position, including securing multiple top rankings from industry analyst houses, Gartner and Forrester. The corporate culture that he has created for Rapid7 has seen the Company named a “Best Place to Work” several times. Mike will continue to act as an advisor to the Company.
"I'm thrilled to have had an opportunity to work with Corey and the team at Rapid7, and am looking forward to our ongoing relationship. We've built a phenomenal team together and earned a leadership position in the market with a bright future of continued growth and success," said Mike Tuchen. "Corey is a remarkable leader who has grown tremendously in the 9 years that we've worked together across two companies, and I'm looking forward to seeing him drive the next stage of the Company's evolution, and the innovation and market leadership that will come from it."

Topeka High product Corey Thomas back at natural position for Shrine Bowl, college career at Emporia State

EL DORADO — In two seasons as Topeka High’s quarterback, Corey Thomas piled up impressive stats — including more than 3,300 yards of total offense and 1,500 rushing yards.



 


But the 5-foot-10, 180-pound Thomas knew long ago that his future was at receiver, a position he played for the Trojans as a sophomore.
“I played quarterback for two years, my junior year and senior year, just because that’s what my team needed, but I definitely feel more comfortable at a receiver/slot-type (position),” Thomas said.
An All-City Top 11 pick as a junior, Thomas is in the process of transitioning back to receiver, playing that position for the East in Saturday’s Kansas Shrine Bowl at Butler County Community College before heading off to Emporia State.


Corey Thomas interview.
Thomas, who accumulated more than 1,400 yards of total offense last fall despite missing time with an injury, said that his experience at quarterback is a benefit.
“It helps with the relationship with the quarterback and just knowing how to run routes and how to stem the safety or linebacker, whatever it is,” said Thomas, also a two-time state placer in track. “It just helps (having played) quarterback.”
Thomas has spent most of his summer at Emporia State, getting ready for the start of preseason practice.
“It’s definitely helped me,” he said. “I’ve gotten in a lot better shape. I’ve gotten stronger and gained some weight, so that’s helped.”
Thomas said being on campus with his Hornet teammates has been an eye-opener about what’s ahead in college.
“It’s so much different than high school,” Thomas said. “You have to work so much harder and the biggest thing is just how many people there are at each position. You can’t take one day off. You’ve got to work day-in and day-out, for sure.”
Thomas is unsure whether or not he’ll be redshirted this fall, but said he is convinced he made the right choice in picking Emporia State.
“I really loved how the coaching staff was so friendly to us,” he said. “They’re player-friendly and they really are good people to us. They help us in the classroom and getting our work done and making us go to class. I love the coaching staff and what it is, and just the school all-around.
“The people that are there, everyone says, ‘Hi.’ No one walks past you and doesn’t say anything. The atmosphere at Emporia State is just perfect. I just felt like it just needed me there.”

“It’s so much different than high school,” Thomas said. “You have to work so much harder and the biggest thing is just how many people there are at each position. You can’t take one day off. You’ve got to work day-in and day-out, for sure.”
Thomas is unsure whether or not he’ll be redshirted this fall, but said he is convinced he made the right choice in picking Emporia State.
“I really loved how the coaching staff was so friendly to us,” he said. “They’re player-friendly and they really are good people to us. They help us in the classroom and getting our work done and making us go to class. I love the coaching staff and what it is, and just the school all-around.
“The people that are there, everyone says, ‘Hi.’ No one walks past you and doesn’t say anything. The atmosphere at Emporia State is just perfect. I just felt like it just needed me there.”
