History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.
In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]
In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.[13]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]
Transmission controversy[edit]
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015,[30] the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”.[31] Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state[32]
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging It to deny Eversource’s proposed $300 Million rate increase. In her testimony[33], she challenged the need for Eversource’s rate increase, noting NSTAR’s and WMECo’s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR’s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.
Major projects[edit]
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.

History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.
In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]
In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.[13]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]
Transmission controversy[edit]
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015,[30] the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”.[31] Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state[32]
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging It to deny Eversource’s proposed $300 Million rate increase. In her testimony[33], she challenged the need for Eversource’s rate increase, noting NSTAR’s and WMECo’s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR’s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.
Major projects[edit]
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]

The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

History[edit]
ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed.
In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States.[9]
Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.
In 2001, NU sold all of Holyoke Water Power Company's electrical distribution and hydroelectric generation assets to the City of Holyoke. The city's municipal gas electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.[10] NU retained the single remaining asset of Holyoke Water Power Company, the Mt. Tom coal-fired generator. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets including Seabrook and Millstone stations as well as its stake in Vermont Yankee. In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shutdown its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to FirstLight Power Resources.[11] PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets).[12]
In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.[13]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.[14] After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.[6] All now currently operate under the Eversource name.
Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 200,000 natural gas customers in 71 cities and towns.
Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses throughout the state. This subsidiary owns three fossil fuel-fired generating plants and nine hydroelectric facilities, jointly capable of generating more than 1,110 megawatts of electricity.
It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.
Political connections[edit]
As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5),[16] the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2),[17] and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1),[18] during the July 2009 to June 2011 period. During the longer four-year period from July 2007 to June 2011, Northeast Utilities and its executives donated $56,900 to Rep. Christopher Murphy,[19] $38,100 to Rep. Joe Courtney,[20] $30,000 to Rep. John Larson,[21] $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4),[22] and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3).[23]
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.[24] During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.[25] New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.[26]
HVDC transmission[edit]
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[27] The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010.[28] In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of Boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.[29]
Transmission controversy[edit]
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015,[30] the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”.[31] Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state[32]
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging It to deny Eversource’s proposed $300 Million rate increase. In her testimony[33], she challenged the need for Eversource’s rate increase, noting NSTAR’s and WMECo’s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR’s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.
Major projects[edit]
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.
With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.
In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.
The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.
In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

Many benefits have been reduced since the merger with NSTAR (such as pay for storm duty, vacation buy, and discounted employee stock purchase). The people who work here are intelligent, hard-working, and want to do the right things for the customers and the company. But due to the problems I described below, it's becoming nearly impossible to do that.ConsSince the merger with NSTAR, the company is run more like a dictatorship than a democracy. This has disenfranchised nearly everyone in the workforce in all positions. All of the lineworkers, electricians, financial analysts, engineers, and low level managers can see how their knowledge and decision making skills are no longer valued by the ivory tower executives. Basic tasks like approving low $ expenditures or filling a position for someone who has left the company are now delayed weeks and sometimes months simply because they require multiple signoffs and justifications from higher ups who just leave the request sitting in their inbox.The company has put a huge focus on safety and customer satisfaction, which are both good things. But safety is being compromised more than ever before, because people are no longer comfortable questioning the decisions being made by upper management. And according to recent JD Power rankings, customer satisfaction is also in the tank, mostly because of high rates and questionable reliability during recent large scale storms. I can assure you that most employees are not singing the praises of this company to their family and friends now, either.Also, it doesn't leave a great impression on employees to see their benefits reduced while an article is published about the Eversource CEO having one of the top 20 highest pensions in the country.Advice to ManagementReliquish control back to local management. Empower them to make decisions and you will empower the entire workforce in turn. This could really be a good place to work for (again). Communicate with people with the understanding that they have common sense and can see through all the typical corporate drone buzzwords.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (8) Eversource Energy Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Eversource Energy 2016-02-08 06:14 PST Feb 13, 2016 Helpful (2)"Project Manager"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Project Manager in Boston, MACurrent Employee - Project Manager in Boston, MARecommendsI have been working at Eversource Energy full-time (Less than a year)ProsGood company to work forConsAged population, hard to attrack new talentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Eversource Energy Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Eversource Energy 2016-02-13 11:12 PSTReviews > Eversource Energy There are newer employer reviews for Eversource EnergySee Most Recent There are newer employer reviews for Eversource EnergySee Most RecentWork at Eversource Energy?

Learn more about evaluating and choosing alternate energy suppliers and see a list of current offers available from suppliers.

Do I need to be present to have my gas or electric service turned on?

Where can I view the Outage Map?






The Outage Map on our website provides details on any outages in your area, and is updated every 15 minutes.








How long will it take to restore my power?






Individual times of restoration depend on the overall damage to substations, and where homes are located along our system. Learn more about our restoration process.

Eversource representatives always carry company-issued photo identification and will always provide it when asked.
Eversource almost never makes unsolicited house visits. Exceptions might include accessing, maintaining, or ensuring the reliable and safe operation of our equipment.
If you’re not sure the person is an Eversource employee, call us. We’ll be glad to verify if work is scheduled at or near your home or business and the identity of the employee.








What types of scams should I look out for?






Many scam artists threaten customers in person, over the phone and online with disconnection of their electric or natural gas service if they don’t make an immediate payment. Another tactic is to offer a bill credit or discounted rate if a customer provides their account number or other information. Learn more about how to protect yourself from scams.

How do I request Tree Trimming or track service request?






You can request a tree-trimming online and track service request.








Why wasn't my request completed?

Eversource Energy, UI, SCG, CNG honored by EPA








05/11/2017



By
Editors of Electric Light & Power/ POWERGRID International




































Sponsored by












The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized Energize Connecticut partners Eversource, United Illuminating, Connecticut Natural Gas and Southern Connecticut Gas as 2017 Energy Star Partners of the Year for Energy Efficiency Program Delivery.
The Energy Star Partner of the Year Award, one of the EPA’s highest honors, highlights outstanding commitments to the creation and promotion of environmentally responsible energy efficiency initiatives. The program delivery category specifically recognizes states, utilities and organizations that sponsor energy efficiency programs to improve the efficiency of products, homes and buildings within their community.
“Thanks to the creative program implementation of partners like Eversource, UI, SCG and CNG, consumers can more easily find energy-efficient Energy Star products in the marketplace,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “Energize Connecticut leads the way by helping Connecticut residents learn how they can protect our environment through energy efficiency.”[Native Advertisement]
Together, Eversource, UI, SCG and CNG administer Energize Connecticut programs. Energize Connecticut is an initiative to help consumers save money and use clean, affordable energy. Energy Star resources and products are components of several of these programs. UI, SCG and CNG are subsidiaries of Orange-based Avangrid.
“Our goal is to inform and educate our customers on making smarter energy choices, and our continuous relationship with the EPA and the Energy Star brand has helped make that a reality,” said Anthony Marone III, President & CEO of Avangrid’s Connecticut companies. “We look forward to expanding our efforts to provide a positive impact to our residential and business customers alike.”
“We are delighted that the EPA has again recognized our efforts in supporting and engaging our customers to help them become more energy efficient,” said Penni Conner, Chief Customer Officer and Senior Vice President of Customer Care for Eversource Energy. “This is an exciting award that not only highlights Connecticut as a national leader in energy efficiency, but shows how we work hard to help our customers save money and save energy.”
Representatives from both companies were recognized at an awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. on April 26.
In 2016, Eversource and the Avangrid subsidiaries accomplished the following in Connecticut:
·        Supported 157 municipalities and boards of education in Connecticut to actively track the energy performance of 2,900 buildings; 90 percent of municipal and Board of Education buildings have been benchmarked.
·        Expanded the Home Performance with Energy Star (HPwES) program to include an income-eligible residential offering.
·        Transitioned HPwES contractor participation to an open-market model where any qualified contractor meeting program standards can participate.
·        Increased sales of Energy Star certified LEDs. LEDs make up over 74 percent of the product mix in Connecticut with sales of over 2.5 million products
·        Connected with more than 10,330 Connecticut residents through the EPA Change the World Tour in October. The tour promoted Energy Star certified LEDs and community action.
·        Introduced web services that link utility accounts directly to an Energy Star Portfolio Manager.
·        Collaborated with the Weatherization Assistance Program to help maximize customers’ savings through cost sharing of the overall project.
·        All of these initiatives are strengthened through the Energy Star product promotion at the Energize Connecticut Center.

I bought the month to month plan not knowing what to expect. I just moved to Texas and setting up my account was so simple and the weekly updates are awesome.

        Love the Service!
Purchased a month ago and I'm quite excited that I'm helping the environment, but the weekly consumption notices help me greatly.

I've been a Green Mountain Energy customer for only a month, but I'm happy I've changed, for the fact it's a clean energy, but also for the customer services.

I purchased  this electric service about a month ago, and I'm glad that I did. It has already put  $$ savings back into my pocket when compared to my previous provider!

        Awesome so far!
I have only had green mountain for a couple months, but it was very highly recommended to me and so far has been great. Rates are very good compared to most others in my area, making payments are easy, and the impact the company has on the environment is great. Glad I went with them, and the no down payment was nice too!
