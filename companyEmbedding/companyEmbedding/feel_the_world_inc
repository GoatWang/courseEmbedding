Helping the Guarani of Sao Paulo
One World Projects through members of the Sao Paulo Kriya Yoga Ashram have been visiting a tribe of indigenous people, known as the Guarani. This tribe of almost 1,000 members have been kicked off their land (out of the forest),  by those who illegally cut and sell the trees for profit. To our standards, they now live in poverty on the outskirts of Sao Paulo; they do not know Western culture and most do not know the language; they are struggling just to have enough food to eat.
