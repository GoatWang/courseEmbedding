Product TypeCasement WindowCasement WindowCasement windows operate by moving away as in-swinging or out-swinging casement vents.  Casement windows operate about a vertical axis and can project toward the interior or the exterior of the frame. This window type uses compression-seal weatherstripping and is offered with adjoining fixed windows.  Graham’s casement windows are architectural grade products with superior performance and durability.  With countless configuration possibilities, glazing options and accessories, these windows are some of the most versatile that we provide.Curtain WallCurtain WallGraham Architectural Products curtain wall is a, custom-engineered, aluminum-framed wall, carrying in-fills of glass, metal panels, louvers, or thin stone such as granite or marble. The framing is attached to the building structure – typically anchored to the edge of the floor slab with some type of anchoring system (there are all different types, none of which carry the floor or roof loads of the building). The wind and gravity loads of the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure, typically at the floor line. DoorsDoorsDesigned to complement our engineering and fabrication capabilities in curtain wall, sunshades and fixed windows, Graham Architectural Products offers a versatile and comprehensive storefront and framing system from single door applications, to large-scale projects requiring multiple points of entry.Dual Action WindowDual Action WindowDual action windows, also referred to as tilt-turn windows, consist of a ventilator that tilts into the room from the top for ventilation and also swings in from the side to allow for easy cleaning of the outside surface. Fixed WindowFixed WindowFixed windows, as the name implies, do not have operable sashes or vents.  The glazing is installed directly into the main frame members.  Because there are no operable parts, these windows do incredibly well for air and water performance.  Our fixed window series are designed to complement our operable window lines or be used separately for areas not requiring ventilation. Horizontal Sliding WindowHorizontal Sliding WindowHorizontal sliding windows or “sliders” consist of one or more horizontal sashes in a master frame.  The operable sash glides on rollers for easy operation and low operating forces.  A single sash or all sashes can operate dependent on needs and preference.  These “by-pass” sashes allow cleaning from the interior without sash removal.  Graham Architectural Products offers multiple configurations and hardware options.  Each model can be used in conjunction with a fixed window series or other operating window types.Hung WindowHung WindowHung windows operate vertically where the weight of the sash is counterbalanced by a balance system mounted within the window frame.  A double hung window can operate both the upper and lower sash, while on a single hung, only the lower sash can open.  Some of our hung windows permit the sash to be tilted inward for cleaning purposes.  Graham also offerd dual or “split sash” with blinds; a pulley balance system where both sashes operate simultaneously; and we are one of the few manufacturers capable of providing true triple hung windows where all sashes can operate.Projected WindowProjected WindowProjected windows operate by moving away, or “projecting” from the plane of the window frame, as awning or hopper vents. Projected windows open and close horizontally and can also project toward the interior or exterior of the frame.  This window type uses compression-seal weatherstripping and is offered with adjoining fixed windows.  Graham’s projected windows are architectural grade products with superior performance and durability.  With countless configuration possibilities, glazing options and accessories, these windows represent a range of possibilities.Security & Vandal ScreensSecurity & Vandal ScreensSecurity and Vandal screens provide the added protection needed to help protect windows from break-ins and vandalism.  The seamless look of Graham Vandal and Security screens eliminates the need for unsightly add-on security screens that detract from the overall look of the building.Window AccessoriesWindow AccessoriesGraham Architectural Products’ design tools include hundreds of special interior trim, exterior panning shapes, and installation accessories, all developed for a variety of specific applications. Graham’s stock profiles make it possible to replicate virtually any existing window with thermally improved Graham architectural windows that save money. Other design options can provide curved window designs for that truly monumental look. TDL, internal muntin and applied muntin designs complement our windows.Window WallWindow WallA window wall is a factory-glazed window (and sometimes door) unit that is installed between the floor slabs of multi-story buildings. When the floor slabs edges are covered on the exterior with aluminum slab covers, the resulting appearance is that of curtain wall. A curtain wall is on the outside of the structure whereas a window wall sits between the floor slabs at the outer edge. In other words, it is a curtain wall but broken at every floor slab. Commercial high-rise office buildings typically use curtain wall while residential high-rise towers are starting to use window wall.Window Frame Depth2.25"2.75"3.0"3.25"3.375"3.5"3.75"4.0"4.5"5.0"6.0"ApplicationsAcousticalCommercialEducationEnergy PerformanceGovernment and MunicipalHealthcareHistoric ReplicationHuman ImpactHurricane ResistantResidential High-RiseSecurity and Blast ResistantSteel Replica WindowsU-Value0.21-0.250.26-0.300.31-0.350.36-0.400.41-0.450.46-0.500.51 & HigherCurtain Wall Product TypeIntegral BlindsPressure Wall - CapturedPressure Wall - SSGPunched Opening FixedStore Front & DoorsSunshades & Light ShelvesUnitized - CapturedUnitized - SSGZero Sight-line Vent
