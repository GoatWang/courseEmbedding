What are 'Holdings'
Holdings are the contents of an investment portfolio held by an individual or entity, such as a mutual fund or a pension fund. Portfolio holdings may encompass a wide range of investment products, from stocks, bonds and mutual funds to options, futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and relatively esoteric instruments such as private equity and hedge funds.!--break--The number and types of holdings within a portfolio contribute to the degree of its diversification. A mix of stocks across different sectors, bonds of different maturities and other investments would suggest a well-diversified portfolio, while concentrated holdings in a handful of stocks within a single sector indicates a portfolio with very limited diversification.Diversification and Acquisition of HoldingsThe proportion of holdings within a portfolio has a significant impact on its overall return. The performance of the largest holdings have a bigger influence on portfolio return than small or marginal holdings in the portfolio. Investors routinely scour the lists of the holdings of top money managers to piggyback on their trades. These investors usually seek to replicate the trading activity of the best money managers by buying stocks where the manager has initiated a long position or added significantly to an existing position and selling positions where the manager has exited a stake. This strategy may not always be successful for the average investor, given the considerable lag between the period when the money manager or fund effected the trades and the time when the fund's holdings are disseminated to the general public.Holding CompaniesHolding companies are a closely related concept. In some cases, investors may choose to own their holdings through a limited liability company (LLC). They may do so to reduce their personal exposure to risk, minimize their taxes or pool their investments with other people, such as business associates or family members. Typically, a holding company does not engage in business directly but only serves as an ownership vehicle of other companies or investments.A very famous example of such a company is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the Omaha, Nebraska company that Warren Buffett controls and manages. Berkshire Hathaway started as a textile manufacturing company, but for several decades, it has only been a holding company that Buffett use to acquire, hold and sell various investments in other companies. Some of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings include the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), Dairy Queen Inc. and the Coca-Cola Company.

Kingdom Holding Company – The Home of Investment
The KHC investment strategy is to identify and support “best of the best” enterprises around the world. We employ detailed selection criteria to maximize long-term returns for shareholders and joint venture partners, and employ an astute approach to realize investment potential in addition to identifying potential assets that are typically undervalued or underperforming, locally and globally through our sound investment strategy. Through this approach KHC has cemented its position as one of the world’s foremost value investors.
But the real strength of the overall KHC portfolio lies in sector diversity. We have major interests in investment categories ranging from luxury hotels and real estate to media and publishing, entertainment, finance and investment services, social media and technology, consumer and retail, petrochemicals, education, private equities, health care, aviation, – even agriculture. KHC is among the world’s largest and most diverse investors, with regional and international holdings in many key industries. We are recognized as one of the largest foreign investors in the United States. We are also active in Africa, an emerging market and growing economic power offering nearly limitless potential.
KHC regularly extends its portfolio to include new opportunities. Current holdings shown do not define the limits of the company’s investment ambitions.
This section of the website provides an overview of KHC’s diverse holdings and rationale for its confidence in select business sectors.
