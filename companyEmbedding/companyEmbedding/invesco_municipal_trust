Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust (NYSE:VCV) institutional sentiment increased to 3.71 in 2016 Q4.Parabolic SAR (or PSAR) is a simple, compact indicator that can provide some useful information when taking into account additional trends and factors. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. The stock's 50-day moving average is $7.85 and its 200 day moving average is $7.70. The 50 day moving average moved up $0.05 whereas the 200 day moving average was up $0.22 or +2.8347%. The stock had a trading volume of 91,945 shares.
SAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, created to identify the turning point in price action. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities.Invesco Van Kampen California Value Municipal Income Trust, formerly Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust, is a diversified, closed-end management investment trust. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. Presently, Yanlord Land Group Ltd (Z25.SI)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -42.86. An oscillator is an indicator that is used as a counter trend showing when the market is overbought or oversold. Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities Trust was formed on September 19, 1988 and is domiciled in the United States. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend.One of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. Accern also assigned press coverage about the investment management company an impact score of 0 out of 100, indicating that recent media coverage is extremely unlikely to have an impact on the stock's share price in the near term. This represents a $0.76 dividend on an annualized basis and a yield of 5.64%. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend.Another technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular momentum indicator used for technical analysis. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

Quality Municipal Income Trust, 20+ Year (QUAL0196)
	
	




Objective
Take advantage of federal tax-exempt investments through a convenient and efficient way of purchasing a professionally selected and diversified portfolio of quality municipal bonds. The Trust is a long-term portfolio1 that offers tax-exempt federal income with the potential for a higher yield than a portfolio holding insured municipal bonds. The bonds in the portfolio are generally not insured, and, if rated, have credit ratings of at least A- by Standard & Poor's or at least A3 by Moody's as of the deposit date.2 The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income3 and to preserve capital. The Trust invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. 




1 Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below it's par value, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return.
2 Each bond’s rating may change after its inclusion in the Trust. 
3 A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit.

 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period).

These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Represents the value per unit of a trust's portfolio securities and other assets reduced by trust expenses and other liabilities, including remaining organization costs, deferred sales charges and creation and the development fee.This page contains historical pricing or historical income distributions information for the unit trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes. Please contact your financial advisor for tax information.This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state, or other jurisdiction to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer. A trust that contains a state name in the trust name is generally available for sale only to investors in that state.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.
