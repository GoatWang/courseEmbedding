I-Minerals TrueQTM Quartz Performs Well in Glaze and Fusion Testing
Mar 29 17
I-Minerals lnc. reported the results of recent research that confirms the excellent quality of the company's high purity quartz products. Recent testing by a ceramic manufacturer confirmed the I-Minerals TrueQTM1 is a desirable product for use in ceramic glazes as a clear transparent glaze formed during testing. In addition, I-Minerals achieved excellent results from a recent soda-lime-silicate glass fusion confirming TrueQTM1 produces a more water white or less colored glass as compared with another western quartz product. The results of this work not only support the low Fe values, but also discovered the clarity of the quartz is as clear as the color. A heavy liquid separation was completed using a certified analytical company and showed heavy minerals were below detection in the TrueQTM products. This research, in addition to specific wet and dry processing techniques, preserves the physical particle size distribution and quality aspects of the product, which sets company apart from the incumbent producer. I-Minerals has developed different grades of quartz, TrueQTM1 (+99.86% SiO2) and its high purity TrueQTM3 (+99.97% SiO2). Currently, research is underway to investigate the geologic deposits of the Helmer-Bovill property for areas that may also have areas of low titanium. These test results confirm TrueQTM1 is well suited for use in the solar glass, specialty glass, display glass, fine ceramics and glaze markets, while opportunities exist for TrueQTM3 as a feedstock for certain ultra-high purity quartz applications and potentially the sodium silicate manufacturing industries. Based on analytical testing to date, a small reduction in titanium will open up additional higher value markets including fiber optics and LED lighting.


I-Minerals Inc. expected to report Fiscal Year 2017 results on July 28, 2017. This event was calculated by Capital IQ (Created on March 16, 2017).

HIGH PUREQUARTZ PRODUCT PRODUCED FROM BASIC FLOTATION OF PRIMARY CLAY MATERIAL     Vancouver, BC, (July 28, 2011) -- i-minerals inc. (TSX.V:IMA , US OTC: IMAHF) announces  it has received initial results from Dorfner Anzaplan (“Dorfner”) a specialty quartz testing laboratory in Germany.  Dorfner’s initial work included a detailed analysis of the quartz product derived from the primary clay material from the Company’s Bovill Kaolin Project. The material was first processed at Ginn Mineral Research in Sandersville, Georgia, wherein the clay fraction (kaolin + halloysite) was separated from the sand fraction (feldspar + quartz).  The sand fraction was then sent to Minerals Research Laboratory at North Carolina State University (“MRL”) where four quartz products were created using a multiple flotation techniques: a 30 mesh one float product (“2011 F1 30”); a finer grind 50 mesh one float product (“2011 F1 50”); a 50 mesh two float product (“2011 F2 50”) and a 50 mesh three float product (“2011 F3 50”).  Dorfner completed analysis of each of the four samples with the results as follows:     2011 F1 30    2011 F1 50   2011 F2 50    2011 F3 50    total impurities (ppm)   1742.07   355.57   303.92   279.57   SiO2 purity   99.730%   99.944%   99.953%   99.956%      High pure quartz products have total impurities less than 500 parts per million (“ppm”) or greater than 99.95% SiO2.  All of the 50 mesh products tested by Dorfner reported total impurities of 356 ppm or less.  The purity levels achieved after the single and second float are some of the best results achieved to date. At least 80% of impurities are attributable to Al+K+Na indicating there is likely trace amounts of feldspar in the quartz product.   High pure quartz products are used in a variety of applications including solar glass, specialty chemicals manufacturing, and optical applications including fibre optics.  Various applications required different specifications for total element content. i-minerals is undertaking additional analysis for less common elements to confirm the quartz product is acceptable into a variety of markets and applications.     The company has commissioned Dorfner to undertake a series of leach testing to see how much further the trace elements can be reduced.      With these results we have now produced high pure quartz from both the granitoid ores of our Kelly’s Basin deposit and the primary clay from the neighboring Bovill Kaolin project,” commented Thomas Conway, President and CEO of i-minerals inc. ”To have achieved this level of purity through basic flotation leaves the company well positioned to be a low cost producer of high purity quartz products and naturally we are all very encouraged with these results.”     A. Lamar Long, CPG, is the Qualified Person (“QP”) for the Helmer-Bovill project under NI 43-101. He oversees the quality control and quality assurance program and the construction of all samples for metallurgical analysis and reviews all analytical results prior to public release.   About i-minerals inc.   i-minerals holds ten minerals leases in northwestern Idaho that hosts Kelly’s Basin feldspar-quartz deposit  that is the subject of an ongoing feasibility study. .  High purity quartz (>99.98% SiO2) can be produced through a standard flotation process.   A pre-feasibility study completed by SRK Consulting (USA) Inc. of Denver Co (“SRK”), calculated a NPV of $61 million and an IRR of 19%.  Preliminary exploration work on occurrences of primary clay deposits has identified variable concentrations of kaolinite, halloysite, quartz and feldspar.  The Company commissioned SRK to complete and initial assessment of the primary clay deposits through a Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “PEA”) which is based upon limited, widely spaced drilling over large areas.  While additional assessment work is required to fully assess the economic viability of the deposits, the PEA yielded a NPV of $95 million and an IRR of 48% and indicated these primary clay deposits may represent the largest deposit of halloysite in North America.  Halloysite is a unique tubular shaped alumina-silicate mineral often referred to as a halloysite nanotube which is being increasingly used in nanotechnology applications.

Kelly's Basin







The Kelly’s Basin deposit is hosted in a border zone of the unweathered Thatuna granodiorite within a lobe of the Idaho Batholith. I-Minerals has identified an initial resource of 9.95 million tons of Thatuna granodiorite, estimated to contain 4.77 million tons of feldspar and 1.79 million tons of quartz. In December 2010 I-Minerals completed a pre-feasibility study on the Kelly’s Basin deposit which contemplated the joint mining of Kelly’s Basin and the WBL tailings. Extensive metallurgical testing repeatedly demonstrates I-Minerals can produce a high quality sodium feldspar (“Na-spar”) and high purity quartz products (>99.98% SiO2) . As part of the prefeasibility process, the Kelly’s Basin mill facility was designed to produce both high quality feldspar and quartz products through a standard flotation process, and high pure quartz products through multi-stage flotation. As designed the flotation circuit would not discharge water, which when coupled with the benign nature of the ores mined would be expected to have limited environmental impact on the surrounding area.However, when compared with the economic assessment of the Kelly’s Basin deposit, the Bovill Kaolin deposits appear to have a higher value mineral product mix a superior NPV and IRR, lower initial capital costs and a shorter payback period. Accordingly, the Bovill Kaolin Deposits will be the focus of I-Minerals efforts in the near term with the Kelly’s Basin deposit to be re-evaluated in the future.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Kaolin





During the weathering of intrusive rocks a process known as “kaolinization” occurs wherein the sodium feldspar breaks down into kaolin group minerals – kaolinite and halloysite. Both are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals.  Kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4 ) occurs as plate-like sheets that commonly appear as “stacked books”. Aggregates of the microscopic kaolinite platelets (commonly termed “kaolin”), are typically soft with increasingly purer varieties displaying greater whiteness and brightness. When kaolin is calcined (heated to about 800o C) it is transformed into a dehydrated, amorphous phase called “metakaolin.”  The heating causes metakaolin to become activated and metastable – a pozzolan.  When metakaolin (or any pozzolan) is added to cement-based mortars, it causes an aggressive reaction with calcium hydroxide (lime) to form compounds with enhanced  performance characteristics including increased strength; reduced permeability; greater durability; effective control of efflorescence; and control of degradation caused by Alkali-Silica Reaction.  The quality of a metakaolin is determined by (i) the amount of lime it is able to bind, (ii) the velocity at which the hydrated lime is reacted, (iii) the mechanical properties of mortars and concrete and (iv) the color (whiter metakaolin can be more easily colored).   I-Minerals will move its kaolin into metakaolin market under the brand name Bovill Metakaolin.  Long term testing by a leading cement laboratory has demonstrated its initial metakaolin product performed at least as well as fly ash, a more common pozzolan in the Pacific Northwest.  Bovill Metakaolin has a finer particle size than I-Minerals’ initial metakaolin product and is now generating pozzolanic results more comparable with higher cost pozzolans such as silica fume.  At present there is no metakaolin production in the Pacific Northwest and transportation costs to bring a Georgia sourced metakaolin make it a high priced pozzolan.  Fly ash, lower cost and generally inferior pozzolan compared to metakaolin is coming under ever increasing environmental pressures presenting a significant market opportunity for I-Mineral’s Bovill Metakaolin.


Uses

Beyond standard ceramic
applications, other uses for kaolin include paper
coating, filler, paint, plastics, fiberglass, catalysts, and other specialty
applications.  It is also used as a key
ingredient in natural pesticides that are suitable for organic farming
applications.  I-Minerals however will
focus almost exclusively on the metakaolin markets.  A bridge deck in a northern climate where it
is subject to the wear and tear associated with plowing and salting is a prime
metakaolin application.

At present there is no metakaolin production in the Pacific Northwest and transportation costs to bring a Georgia sourced metakaolin make it a high priced pozzolan.  Fly ash, lower cost and generally inferior pozzolan compared to metakaolin is coming under ever increasing environmental pressures presenting a significant market opportunity for I-Mineral’s Bovill Metakaolin.


Uses

Beyond standard ceramic
applications, other uses for kaolin include paper
coating, filler, paint, plastics, fiberglass, catalysts, and other specialty
applications.  It is also used as a key
ingredient in natural pesticides that are suitable for organic farming
applications.  I-Minerals however will
focus almost exclusively on the metakaolin markets.  A bridge deck in a northern climate where it
is subject to the wear and tear associated with plowing and salting is a prime
metakaolin application.

Quartz





          Quartz (SiO2 or silicon dioxide) is crystalline silica, the second most common mineral in the crust of the earth. It is well known for its hardness and its use in glass.  However, different types of glass require different SiO2 purity levels with the most basic flat glass (e.g. house windows) only requiring SiO2 purities of about 98.5%, while more complex glass such as solar glass or LCD glass have desired purities in excess of 99.95% SiO2.   Although silicon dioxide is abundant, not all deposits are chemically exact, with the SiO2 purity and the levels of various trace element impurities varying across different deposits. Contamination of quartz can be from mineral and fluid inclusions and non-silica elements entering atomic sites usually occupied by silicon and oxygen. I-Minerals is developing three quartz products under the TrueQTM that offer different SiO2 purities and each product will be available in a variety of grinds.  TrueQ1TM is a single float +99.9% SiO2 product, TrueQ2TM is a twice floated +99.94% SiO2 product and TrueQ3TM is a thrice floated +99.97% SiO2 product.



Uses
Higher value applications for quartz products
the Company is targeting include sodium silicate, fused silica, epoxy molding
compounds, square quartz crucibles for polysilicon manufacture, Halogen,
fluorescent and xenon lamps, quartz for making fused silica grain, specialty
ceramic glazes, paint, solar glass, optical glass, art glass, glass bulbs,
liquid crystal display (LCD) glass. Fused silica grain is a raw material for
square silica crucibles used to produce directionally solidified,
polycrystalline, solar cells.  +5ppm of
Ti is limiting the use of TrueQ3 in mainstream LED and fibre optic
applications, but I-Minerals is undertaking additional testing to see  how much Ti can be removed and in the interim
it is examining quartz fibers and quartz tubes that are doped with titanium for
optical and/or catalyst application (e.g. lasers and tanning lights).
