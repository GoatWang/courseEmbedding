Published on Mar 24, 2015Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn since 2008, has grown 32m members to 347m, $78m in revenue to $2.2b, and 338 employees to 6k. Prior to LinkedIn, Jeff lead various product teams at Yahoo for more than seven years, most recently as EVP of Yahoo's Network Division where he led a team of 3,000+ employees and managed products reaching 500m+ consumers. Jeff sits down with Jason at the Launch Festival 2015 and reveals the biggest driver of LinkedIn’s revenue (along with the other area that has been the fastest growing product in the company’s history), how members can use the publishing platform to increase personal opportunities, why Jeff took over the product function, what five attributes make a great product, what it was like working at Yahoo, why he doesn’t want to buy The Wall Street Journal, and what the future holds for this powerhouse company.Never miss an episode!

Linkedin CEO: These five things make a world-class tech product

  Linkedin CEO Jeff Weiner believes that great products can be
  separated from not-so-great products through five key principles.

  Taking the stage at the Launch
  Conference in San Francisco today, he gave the audience of
  startup entrepreneurs and investors five characteristics that
  make up a world-class tech product, and gave an example for each
  one.
1. Great products deliver a singular value
  proposition. Weiner highlighted
  Google as a perfect example of this. Before they
  erupted onto the scene, AltaVista was the most prominent search
  engine at the time. However, because Google "just focused on
  their logo and a search box, "they eventually changed the world
  with their search engine."  Earlier in the talk, he used
  Yahoo as an example of what not to do. He said that "each time
  they went into another vertical, they encountered competition."
2. They anticipate a customer's
  needs. Weiner said that Waze is a
  perfect example of a product that knows what its customer wants
  and delivers on it. He told the audience that one day, as he was
  about to leave work, he turned on Waze and was about to type in
  his home address when a message popped up asking whether he was
  going home.  Combining driving directions and mapping
   intelligence, Waze had figured out the general time he
  usually headed home, using this information to anticipate his
  daily commute time.  This, he said, "sends the signal that
  the product understands me."
3. They exceed expectations: Weiner told
  the audience that one night, he and his wife were hosting a
  party. He was in charge of music for the night, but because his
  wi-fi had just been reconfigured, his
  Sonos music system was not working. He
  called their customer service line, and was told that because it
  was a holiday, the offices were closing in 15 minutes. In the
  end, Weiner said that "the customer service exceeded expectations
  ... the guy stayed an hour after close to help me set up music."
  It helps to not only have a great product, but reliable and
  dedicated customer service, as well.




4. They resonate
  emotionally. According to Weiner, a perfect example
  of a product that resonates emotionally is a
  Tesla — "it's like driving an iPhone," he said.
  He constantly mentioned how using the product felt like "driving
  the future," a catchphrase that Tesla has never once marketed. He
  mentioned how others have said the exact same thing about driving
  Tesla's, which really hammered home the point that the best
  products make you feel without directly prompting you.
5. Have a meaningful impact on your
  life: Weiner mentioned that his
  "iPhone has become the control panel of [his]
  life." The best products are the ones that are so helpful, they
  manage to change your routines and serve as an extension of
  yourself.

LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner describes 3 qualities that make a great leader

LinkedIn CEO Jeff
  Weiner.

  Since becoming CEO in 2009, Jeff Weiner has led LinkedIn to
  become a network of 364 million registered users with offices in
  30 countries and a market cap of $26
  billion.

  Weiner's leadership style has earned him the trust of founder
  and chairman Reid Hoffman, his team, and LinkedIn investors.
  Glassdoor named him the highest-rated 
  CEO of 2014.

  Earlier this year, Weiner spoke at the
  Wisdom 2.0 conference in San Francisco, where he explained
  how he understands his role as a leader.

  Firstly, he sees the role of a manager as someone who tells
  others what to do, whereas a leader inspires others to do great
  things.

  He broke down three functions of an inspirational leader.





  They are clear about their company's vision.

  Weiner said LinkedIn employees know the company strives to
  enhance the productivity and economic opportunity of everyone in
  the world, pushing them to constantly reach more people.

  Fred Kofman, LinkedIn's VP of leadership and organizational
  development, was also on the panel and said he has a visual
  metaphor for how he sees Weiner.

  Most CEOs sit at the front of a boat and tell their employees
  where they need to row; Weiner grabs a surfboard and catches a
  huge wave, inspiring everyone behind him to do the same. The
  surfers are all riding the same wave, sharing the same vision,
  but are putting much more of their heart and personality into
  their work than the grunts in the rowboat.

  They are brave.

  Weiner said it's necessary to have courage because "if you have
  true vision and you want to try something that hasn't been done
  before, there's gonna be a lot of naysayers, there's gonna be a
  lot of skeptics, there's gonna be a lot of people who feel
  threatened and try to get in your way.

  "You have to feel it deeply to be able to overcome those
  challenges and for people to want to follow you. And if you're
  not authentic in that belief and you don't have true conviction,
  they're not gonna be behind you," he said.

  They are effective communicators.

  Weiner told Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget last year that
  the role of chief executive requires a constant awareness of how
  you are communicating your vision and conviction to the rest of
  the company.

  "The more people you're responsible for, the more your words and
  the way you communicate those words and your body language and
  essentially everything you do is taken into consideration by the
  team," he said.

  "You have to be that much more aware of the way in which you're
  coming across. And I think the best leaders maintain awareness of
  their environment and in real time can course correct. It doesn't
  matter if they're in a one-on-one, a staff meeting, an all-hands,
  or speaking to thousands of people at a keynote. They are always
  aware of the way they are being received. They can course correct
  so they can ensure that what they're saying is resonating and
  that it's bringing people together."

  At the Wisdom 2.0 Conference, Weiner said that if as a leader you
  are able to incorporate these three aspects into your role, then
  the job just becomes "a matter of what objective you're trying to
  achieve and then surrounding yourself with the best talent you
  can."

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
