					Full Description



Native American Energy Group, Inc., incorporated on November 1, 1996, is a development-stage energy resource development and management Company. The Company’s properties consist of interests in properties on which oil and gas wells are located, both non-producing and in progress, as well as undeveloped properties. The Company’s projects include development of oil and gas interests in the Williston Basin in Montana; development of coal-bed methane natural gas (CBM) in the Cook Inlet Basin in Alaska and development of oil and gas properties on Native and non-Native American lands in Oklahoma using newer drilling and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) technologies.The Company has a pilot five well work-over program on four oil and gas lease holdings in the Williston Basin in Montana. The Company has completed the first phase of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations on four of its five wells. As a result of the initial EOR operations, the Company has collected and sold approximately 919 barrels of oil. The Company focuses on four oil and gas leases on and around the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in the Williston Basin in Montana. The Company also explores areas where there are known coal resources because such areas have an increased likelihood of containing Coal Bed Methane (CBM). The Company has entered into a technology and distribution rights agreement for vertical axis wind turbines created by Windaus Energy, Inc. of Brantford, Ontario (Windaus). The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries include NAEG Alaska Corporation NAEG CBM Operations LLC.

The Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss all claims alleged in the lawsuit with prejudice and on January 30, 2012 filed with the Court a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice. Nonetheless, in an effort to avoid further litigation, we, on behalf of the Company and the other Defendants, have agreed to issue to the Plaintiffs an aggregate of 606,756 shares of the Company's common stock in addition to the 1,738,750 shares already held in escrow for a total of 2,345,506 shares of our Common Stock (the "Settlement Shares"). We have further agreed that within 30 calendar days of the removal of the global lock by DTC, we will issue each Plaintiff an individual warrant. The term of each individual warrant shall be for two years from the date of the removal of the DTC global lock and shall be for the purchase of a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the number of Settlement Shares received by that individual Plaintiff, with an exercise price of $0.70 per share.                                                                                                   14-Apr-2016 Regulation FD Disclosure, Financial Statements and Exhibits    Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure  Native American Energy Group, Inc. corrected and replaced its release issued on April 13, 2016 - "Native American Energy Group Announces Transfer Agent Change" due to multiple revisions to the "Effective Date" in the first and bottom section. The corrected release reads: CORRECTION - Native American Energy Group Announces Transfer Agent Change. Native American Energy Group, Inc. changed its transfer agent for NAGP common stock from Pacific Stock Transfer Company to Manhattan Transfer Registrar Company ("Manhattan"), effective, April 25, 2016 (the "Effective Date"), with its current address at 57 Eastwood Rd, Miller Place, NY 11764. Registered stockholder accounts will be transferred automatically to Manhattan Transfer Registrar Co. without interruption in service. No action is required by stockholders. A copy of the Company's press release to its stockholders is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  Most recent update of operations provided by MBAA519 on 6/9/2017...and thanks for this go out to this concerned investor  1. Montana is inactive and has not produced any oil or has reported to the state since 9-2012.   http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/WebApps/DataMiner/Production/ProductionByWell.aspx   2. Alaska has stalled and there is no bonding in place nor is the a bond in place for Montana   NOTE 6 – SECURITY DEPOSITS from last 10-K/A   The Company had an aggregate of -0- and $50,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, deposited in two financial institutions as collateral for posted surety bonds with various governmental agencies in Alaska and Montana as assurance for possible well-site reclamation, if required. The Company is obligated to maintain a surety bond in conjunction with certain drilling permits. In March 2011 and in September 2012, the Company cancelled two of its oil and gas surety bonds in the aggregate amount $150,000 issued to the Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (“AOGCC”) and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough Planning Commission (“Mat-Su Borough”) for its Kircher Unit state and borough drilling permits in Alaska. As a result of the bond terminations, the financial institution returned the $150,000 cash collateral to the Company. In the event that the Company re-applies for the state and borough drilling permits with the AOGCC and the Mat-Su Borough, it will be required to re-post bonds in the amount of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company forfeited an $8,590 deposit held as security for its corporate office lease in New York.   3. As for the wind generation Windaus was acquired by another public company so I don't know what the position for NAGP is with that project for they were in default of the original agreement that was modified for missing the payment schedule.   https://www.windstream-inc.com/   4. As for Oklahoma I cant find any well info in their database assigned to NAGP.   This is current knowledge that is available for NAGP not negative not positive just current knowledge.    https://biz.yahoo.com/e/160414/nagp8-k_a.html  Shareholder updates and press releases  from the company website:  http://www.nativeamericanenergy.com/investors/press-releases/  Note: This information seems out of date but is due to the fact that the company has little or no current info available to investors other than what is on the webiste listed above. ANY new information, filings and evidence of current operations will be added when they are made available.   The moderator of this board will post info in the IBOX that one can use to start DD on this play. Although the moderator will try his best to post info which is beleived to be true, one should determine this for sure with doing additional DD to confirm all info in this IBOX. The moderator assumes no responsibilty that all the info in the IBOX is true since he will post links and info supplied by others including posters from this board. The moderator freely admits that at this time he has very little invested with this company, and in no way what is posted in the IBOX should be taken as advise to buy or not buy this stock. PLEASE BE SMART AND DO YOUR OWN DD

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
To learn more visit our blog.



Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
