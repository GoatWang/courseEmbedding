	PROSPECTUS – SUBJECT TO COMPLETION
	DATED JUNE 21, 2016



	 



	Red Fish Holdings



	 



	Up to 1,000,000 Common Shares at $.20 per
	Share



	 


	Red Fish Holdings (“we”,
	“us”, or the “Company”) is offering for sale a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value
	$0.001 per share, at the price of $.20 per share.  There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering
	to close, and therefore we may receive no proceeds or very minimal proceeds from the offering.  The aggregate offering price
	of all securities sold under this prospectus may not exceed $200,000. The offering will commence on the effective date of this
	prospectus and will terminate on the sooner of the sale of the total number of shares being sold, one year from the effective date
	of this Prospectus or the decision by Company management to deem the offering closed.


	We will sell the common shares ourselves
	and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no
	one has agreed to buy any of our common shares. The common shares will be sold by Mr. Thomas Mahoney, the Company’s Chief
	Executive Officer and Director. There is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of such
	common shares will go into escrow, trust or another similar arrangement. Because there is no minimum that must be raised from this
	offering, potential investors may be left holding shares in a company that has not received enough proceeds from the offering to
	cover offering expenses, pay for the expenses of being a reporting company, or begin operations. We will bear the all of the costs
	associated with this offering.


	This is our initial public offering. Our common
	stock is not listed for trading on any exchange or automated quotation system. We intend, upon the effectiveness of the registration
	statement of which this prospectus is a part, to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.
	There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory
	Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for
	quotation will be approved. Additionally, there can be no assurances that enough shares will be sold in this offering to create
	a market for our shares.


	 


	We were incorporated in the State of Wyoming
	on August 4, 2015. We are a developmental stage company, with limited operational history. Our business strategy is to acquire
	undervalued assets within the mobile application and mobile gaming industries as well as the small patented technologies industry
	and to develop and enhance their visibility through web-based and traditional marketing. To identify potential acquisitions, we
	intend to look for assets that have not been marketed to the general public yet, have the ability to generate interest from the
	public, and have the potential to be monetized within a short time horizon. Readers are encouraged to reference the section entitled
	“Business Operations” found on page 22 herein for additional information regarding our business.


	 


	Our auditors have indicated in their
	opinion on our financial statements as of and for the period from inception to February 29, 2016 that there exists
	substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, we are an early stage venture with limited
	operating history.

	As such, this offering is highly speculative and the common stock being offered for sale involves a
	high degree of risk and should be considered only be persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Readers are
	encouraged to reference the section entitled “Risk Factors” found on page 9 herein for additional information
	regarding the risks associated with our company and common stock.



	 


	Please note that the Company is a “shell”
	company in accordance with Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, any securities sold in this offering
	can only be resold through registration under the Securities Act of 1933; Section 4(1), if available, for non-affiliates; or by
	meeting the following conditions of Rule 144(i): (a) the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased
	to be a shell company; (b) the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(D) of the
	Exchange Act of 1934; and the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed during
	the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form
	8-K reports; and at least one year has lapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission
	reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.

	A CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS



	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements
	which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
	terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”,
	“believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the
	negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements
	about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan,
	and the adequacy of our available cash resources.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
	statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Actual results
	may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements.  The economic environment within
	which we operate could materially affect our actual results.  Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking
	statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the volatility of real estate prices, the possibility that our marketing
	efforts will not be successful in identifying customers in need of our products and services, the Company’s need for and
	ability to obtain additional financing, and, other factors over which we have little or no control.


	 


	While these forward-looking statements,
	and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction
	of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions
	or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United
	States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.






	SUMMARY INFORMATION



	 


	As used in this prospectus, references to the
	“Company,” “we,” “our”, “us” or “Company Name” refer to Red Fish Holdings
	unless the context otherwise indicated.


	 


	You should carefully read all information in
	the prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes, under the Financial Statements prior to making
	an investment decision.


	 






	The Company




	 





	Organization:




	We were incorporated under the laws of the
	State of Wyoming on August 4, 2015. Our principal office is located at 1360 Little Duck Cir. Gulf Breeze, FL 32563. Our telephone
	number is (858) 531-4361.


	 






	Capitalization:




	Our articles of incorporation provide for the
	issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001. As of the date of this Prospectus there are 5,000,000 shares
	of our common stock issued and outstanding. Our articles of incorporation do not provide for the issuance of any preferred stock
	or other class of equity securities.


	 






	Management:




	Our Chief Executive Officer, Director and Secretary
	is Tom Mahoney. Tom Mahoney represents our lone employee. Mr. Mahoney expects to devote approximately 80 hours each month to the
	Company.


	 






	Controlling Shareholders:




	Our Chief Executive Officer, Director and Secretary,
	Tom Mahoney, is our lone shareholder having five million shares. Mr. Mahoney will continue to exercise significant control over
	the affairs of the Company following the offering.


	 






	 


	 




	6




	 




	 







	Shell Company Status:




	We are a 

	“shell company”

	 within
	the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we have nominal assets and nominal operations.  Accordingly,
	the securities sold in this offering can only be resold through registration under Section 5 the Securities Act of 1933, Section
	4(1), if available, for non-affiliates or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i).  A holder of our securities may not rely
	on the safe harbor from being deemed statutory underwriter under Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, as provided by Rule 144,
	to resell his or her securities. Only after we (i) are not a shell company, and (ii) have filed all reports and other materials
	required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter
	period that we may be required to file such reports and materials, other than Form 8-K reports); and have filed current 

	“Form
	10 information”

	 with the SEC reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of
	not less than 12 months, can our securities be resold pursuant to Rule 144.  

	“Form 10 information”

	 is,
	generally speaking, the same type of information as we are required to disclose in this prospectus, but without an offering of
	securities.  These circumstances regarding how Rule 144 applies to shell companies may hinder your resale of your shares of the
	Company.


	 






	Going Concern:




	Our independent auditor has expressed substantial
	doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact that to date we have generated
	no revenues. Potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new venture, and the high
	rate of failure associated with this fact.


	 


	We have an accumulated deficit of ($4,692)
	and have not generated any revenues since inception. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future
	profitable operations from our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.






	 



	Our company
	and our officers, directors, any company promoter and their affiliates do not intend, once we are reporting, to use our company
	as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company.  We are not a blank check company, as such term is
	defined by Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as we have a specific business plan and we presently
	have no plans or intentions to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company, companies, entity or person

	 


	 






	Our Business




	 





	Plan of Operations:




	The Company plans to be primarily engaged in
	acquiring undervalued assets within the mobile application and mobile gaming industries as well as the small patented technologies
	industry and to develop and enhance their visibility through web-based and traditional marketing in an effort to generate revenue.
	To identify potential acquisitions, we intend to look for assets that have not been marketed to the general public yet, have the
	ability to generate interest from the public, and have the potential to be monetized within a short time horizon.


	 






	Historical Operations:




	Since inception, the Company has been negotiating
	acquisitions of mobile gaming applications. To date, the Company has added one (1) mobile gaming application, Dessert Crush Saga
	- on the iOS platform - to its portfolio. To date, the Company has generated an accumulated deficit of ($4,692) largely related
	to startup costs.


	 






	 


	 







	Current Operations:




	The Company is currently working on developing its iOS mobile application and mobile gaming portfolio. This includes both evaluating opportunities for acquisitions as well as developing mobile applications “In house.”  The Company is seeking outside talent to further develop the flagship asset, a free-to-play mobile interactive match-three puzzle game called Dessert Crush Saga, with the focus on obtaining a sizeable user base and establishing user-based traction.

	Class of Securities Offered:




	Common stock, par value $0.001 per shares.


	 






	No. of Shares being Sold in the Offering:




	One million (1,000,000).


	 






	Offering Price:




	The Company intends to offer its common stock
	at $0.20 per share.


	 






	No. of Shares Outstanding:

	Termination of the Offering:




	The offering will commence as of the effective
	date of this Prospectus and will terminate on the sooner of 	the sale of the total number of shares being sold, one year from
	the effective date of this Prospectus or the decision by Company management to deem the offering closed.


	 






	Offering Costs:




	We estimate our total offering registration
	costs to be $25,000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding, our officer and director has verbally agreed to advance
	funds to the Company to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and correspondence with our shareholders; however our
	officer and director has no legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company.


	 






	Market for our Common Stock:




	Our common stock is not listed for trading
	on any exchange or automated quotation system. We intend, upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus
	is a part, to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that
	a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates
	the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved.


	 






	Common Stock Control:




	Tom Mahoney, our Chief Executive Officer and
	only director, currently owns all the issued and outstanding common stock of the company, and will continue to own sufficient common
	shares to control the operations of the company after this offering, irrespective of its outcome.


	 






	Penny Stock Regulations:




	The liquidity of our common stock is restricted
	as the registrant’s common stock falls within the definition of a penny stock. These requirements may restrict the ability
	of broker/dealers to sell the registrant's common stock, and may affect the ability to resell the registrant's common stock.


	 






	Best Efforts Offering:




	We are offering our common stock on a “best
	efforts” basis through our Chief Executive Officer, who will not receive any discounts or commissions for selling the shares.
	There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold in order to close this offering.


	 






	 







	Use of Proceeds:




	We will use the proceeds of this offering to first cover administrative expenses in connection with this offering. We plan to use the remaining proceeds, if any, to further our business plan. We retain wide discretion with respect to the proceeds of this offering






	 




	Implications of being an Emerging
	Growth Company




	 


	As a company
	with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an 

	“emerging growth company”

	 as
	defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An 

	“emerging growth
	company”

	 may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies.
	These provisions include, but are not limited to:


	 




	8




	 




	 




	 



	-



	 



	being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this prospectus;





	 




	 



	-



	 



	not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;





	 




	 



	-



	 



	reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and





	 




	 



	-



	 



	exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.





	We may use
	these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering.
	However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a 

	“large accelerated
	filer,”

	 our annual gross revenue exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt
	in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period.


	 


	The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth
	company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected
	to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs
	Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public
	and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
	may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.



	 






	Summary Financial Information




	 


	Because this is only a financial summary,
	it does not contain all the financial information that may be important to you. Therefore, you should carefully read all the information
	in this prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes before making an investment decision.

	RISK FACTORS



	In addition to other information provided
	in this prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any of
	our common stock.  All material risks are discussed in this section.


	 




	Risks Related to Our Company




	 




	Our having generated no revenues from
	operations makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our
	future performance.




	 


	As of February 29, 2016 we have generated no
	revenues and incurred a loss of ($4,692). As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results
	based upon our historical data.  Because of the related uncertainties, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and
	timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues and expenses.  If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable
	data, we may never become profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price. 


	 




	We may be unable to continue paying the costs of being a reporting
	public company.




	 



	The costs of
	being a public reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may be substantial and the Company


	may
	not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease being public in the future or require additional
	fundraising in order to remain in business. We estimate that in the future, costs for legal and accounting will be approximately
	$25,000 per year


	.



	 




	We are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes
	us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights.




	 


	We may offer to sell our common stock to investors
	pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state
	securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon
	our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may not seek any legal opinion
	to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we may elect to
	relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investor themselves.


	 


	If any such offering did not qualify for such
	exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible that if
	an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those states where
	the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification
	provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful in
	seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally,
	if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties
	imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies.


	 


	 




	Our auditor has indicated in its report
	that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and if we
	are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.




	 




	10




	 




	Our auditor has indicated in its report that
	our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements
	do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate significant revenue
	or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.


	 


	 




	Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws limit the liability
	of, and provide indemnification for, our officers and directors.




	 


	Our Certificate of Incorporation, generally
	limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the Company and its stockholders for breach of fiduciary
	duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve
	intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, provide indemnification for
	our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the Wyoming General Corporation Law against all expense, liability,
	and loss, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement reasonably
	incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, administrative
	or investigative (hereinafter a “Proceeding") to which the officer or director is made a party or is threatened to be
	made a party, or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of
	the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company whether the basis of the Proceeding is an alleged action in an
	official capacity as an officer or director, or in any other capacity while serving as an officer or director. Thus, the Company
	may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities
	incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the Company.  Such an indemnification payment might deplete the
	Company's assets. Stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of the Company
	should consult with independent legal counsel. It is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that exculpation from
	and indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
	is against public policy and therefore unenforceable.


	 




	We are dependent on the sale of our securities
	to fund our operations

	.



	 


	We are dependent on the sale of our securities
	to fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs.  Our officers
	and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans
	and/or financial guarantees. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our equity or debt securities.


	 




	The Company may not be able to attain
	profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable.





	 



	The Company has limited capital resources.
	Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, the Company may experience
	liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing
	is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations.


	 




	Expenses required to operate as a public
	company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our
	results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.




	 


	Operating as a public company is more expensive
	than operating as a private company, including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor
	relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned.  We may also be required to hire additional staff
	to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements.  We anticipate that the cost of SEC reporting will be approximately
	$25,000 annually.  Our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively
	affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.  If we fail to meet
	these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board, or,
	if we have secured a qualification, we may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the OTC Bulletin
	Board.  Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors
	will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly, annual reports and other required
	SEC reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming
	a non-reporting issuer.


	 




	Our lack of history makes evaluating our business difficult.




	 


	 


	We have a limited operating history and we may not sustain profitability
	in the future.


	 




	11




	 




	To sustain profitability, we must:


	 




	 



	-




	develop mobile applications for which there is significant consumer deamnd





	 




	 



	-




	compete with larger, more established competitors in the mobile appli





	 




	 



	-




	build, maintain, and enhance our portfolio of individual labels and overall brand recognition; and





	 




	 



	-




	adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments.





	 


	We may not be successful in accomplishing
	these objectives. Further, our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. Our prospects
	must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their
	early stages of development, particularly companies in highly competitive industries. The historical information in this report
	may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance.



	 




	Risks Related to Our Business



	 




	We operate in highly competitive and
	rapidly evolving technology markets, and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete
	effectively in the future.




	 


	The mobile application market is highly competitive
	and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based on brand name recognition, product quality, and purchasing convenience. Our
	business will likely face competition from other large corporations and regional investment groups. We have no direct competitors
	that compete within our business model, per se. However, we compete with many companies and investment groups that seek to purchase
	distressed and undervalued or underfunded mobile applications, software programs, and other small patentable technologies with
	the intention of maximizing its monetization potential. Moreover, the market for mobile games in particular is crowded with a large
	number of established and specialized companies.

	See

	Risks Related to Our Business - “The markets in which we operate
	are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.”


	 




	The business to consumer marketplace is highly competitive.
	If we cannot develop and promote confidence in our Company we may not be able to compete with our competitors, which
	would adversely affect our ability to general revenues.




	 


	We have many potential competitors in the business
	to consumer marketplace. In most instances, our competition is competent, experienced, and has greater financial, and marketing
	resources than we do at the present. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote
	greater resources to the development, promotion, and marketing of their services than are available to us. Our competitors may
	also offer a wider range of products and have greater brand recognition. They may have greater customer loyalty bases and these
	competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities. In addition, our competitors may be able to undertake
	more extensive promotional activities, and adopt more aggressive advertising campaigns than the Company.


	 




	The markets
	in which we operate are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.

	 



	 



	Developing
	or enhancing development of, distributing, and selling mobile applications and mobile gaming applications is a highly competitive
	business marked by continuous introductions of new products as well as rapidly emerging platforms, technologies, and digital storefronts.  For
	players, we compete primarily on the basis of game


	quality, brand, and customer reviews.  We
	compete for promotional and storefront placements based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the digital storefront
	owner, historical performance, perception of sales potential, and relationships with licensors of brands, properties and other
	content.  For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development
	quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners. We also compete
	for experienced and talented employees and consultants.



	 


	We compete with a
	continually increasing number of public companies, including Activision, DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, GREE,
	GungHo Online Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Nexon, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies,
	including Kabam, Machine Zone, Rovio, Storm 8/Team Lava, and Supercell.  In addition, we face competition from online
	game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets.  We could also face increased
	competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to
	us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook or Yahoo, choose to enter or
	expand into the game space or develop competing games.




	12




	 




	 


	In addition, given
	the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also
	compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other
	content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. The proliferation
	of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete
	for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.


	 


	Some of our competitors and our potential
	competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:


	 




	 



	•




	significantly greater financial resources;





	 




	 



	•




	greater experience with the free-to-play games and more effective game monetization;





	 




	 



	•




	stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;





	 




	 



	•




	greater experience and effectiveness integrating community features into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users through social gamification;





	 




	 



	•




	the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;





	 




	 



	•




	larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;





	 




	 



	•




	larger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;





	 




	 



	•




	more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;





	 




	 



	•




	lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;





	 




	 



	•




	greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and





	 




	 



	•




	broader global distribution and presence.





	 


	If we are unable to compete effectively or
	we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could
	lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.


	 




	Sales of and demand for our portfolio
	products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends.




	 


	Our success depends on our ability to anticipate
	and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable
	product offerings. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the
	market for our products, our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished
	goods inventory.


	 


	 


	In response, we may be forced to increase our
	marketing promotions, provide mark-down allowances to our customers or liquidate excess merchandise, any of which could have a
	material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. Our brand image may also suffer if customers believe that we are no
	longer able to offer innovative products, respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our products.


	 


	Since our free-to-play games can be downloaded
	and played for free, we have to succeed in generating a significant number of game installations and significant user-base growth.  However,
	we will rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenues derived from in-app purchases (as opposed
	to advertisements and incentivized offers).  To significantly increase our revenues, we must increase the number of players
	who convert into a paying player by making in-app purchases, increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games and/or
	increase the length of time our players generally play our games.  We may encounter difficulties with game monetization
	(for example, developing a sufficient quantity and variety of virtual goods to enable a relatively large scale of in-app purchases
	by an individual user) if we cannot predict consumer preferences and trends.


	 




	We will likely
	derive the majority of our revenues from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if either of these storefronts
	were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.




	 




	13




	 





	Our
	first mobile application is currently available on the Apple App Store, and we intend to make an Android version available on the
	Google Play Store in the future. The majority of our smartphone revenues will likely be derived from Apple’s iOS platform
	with the significant majority of such revenues derived from in-app purchases.  We will try to generate the balance of
	our iOS-related revenues from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent,
	sales of premium games.




	 




	We
	will need to maintain a good relationship with Apple and Google, which can lead to our applications being featured on their storefronts
	when they were commercially released.  If we do not receive prominent featuring, users may find it more difficult to
	discover our games and we may not generate revenues from them.  We may also be required to spend significantly more on
	marketing campaigns to increase visibility of our products and generate substantial revenues on these platforms.  In
	addition, currently neither Apple nor Google charges a publisher when it features one of their apps.  If either Apple
	or Google were to charge publishers to feature an app, it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably.  Accordingly,
	any change or deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock
	price to decline

	.  


	 


	We will likely rely
	on the continued functioning of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.  In the past these digital storefronts
	have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality.  


	If either of these
	events recurs on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenues from these storefronts,
	it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.  In addition, if these storefront operators
	fail to provide high levels of service, our players’ ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive
	the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand.


	 




	We may publish
	games developed by third parties, which may expose us to a number of potential operational and legal risks.



	 




	 




	Our
	Company may plan on entering into relationships with developers of games, primarily in Asian and Eastern European markets, where
	we will localize and globally publish those games.   We may be required to provide third party developers with upfront
	license fees or non-recoupable minimum guarantees in order to obtain the rights to publish their games, and we may incur significant
	costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched.  




	 




	The
	games may not be commercially successful if they do not appeal to a Western audience, if our limited experience in publishing other
	developers’ games leads to unexpected results or for any other reason, which would negatively impact our operating results.  
	In addition, if any of the games created by third party developers


	with which we work
	or acquire infringe intellectual property owned by others, or otherwise violate any third party’s rights or any applicable
	laws and regulations, such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy, we would be exposed to potential legal risks by
	publishing these games

	.  


	 


	 




	The operators
	of digital storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of
	our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others’ contracts with
	them


	.




	 


	We will likely distribute
	our free-to-play games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, for which the distribution terms and conditions are often 

	“click
	through”

	agreements that we are not able to negotiate.  For example, we are subject to each of Apple’s
	and Google’s standard click-through terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution
	and operation of apps, including games, on their storefronts.  Either Apple or Google can unilaterally change its standard
	terms and conditions with no prior notice to us.  


	 


	In addition, the agreement
	terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator.  Further, these storefront operators
	typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates
	its standard terms and conditions.  For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting certain types
	of virtual currency-incentivized advertising offers in games sold on the Apple App Store.


	 


	Most recently, Apple
	has implemented certain restrictions related to games that include guns, including changing its game rating methodology, which
	has resulted in games that include gun violence receiving a 17+ rating, and prohibiting certain depictions of guns in game icons
	and other storefront art; these restrictions, could potentially negatively impact the number of people playing popular 

	“shooter”

	 games
	and the revenues we could generate from such assets, if we chose to acquire one.  


	 


	In addition, during
	the second quarter of 2014, Apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incentivized video advertising in games sold
	on the Apple App Store.  These incentivized video advertisements have attempted to take into




	14




	 




	account several pitfalls
	of the older ad-revenue models in place for mobile applications, however, the Apple Store has prohibited the use of such strategies
	because of its “unfair” effect on chart rankings and thus deemed it a violation of their terms. If Apple or Google,
	or any other key storefront operator, determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions,
	by a new interpretation or otherwise or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront, it would materially harm our
	business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline.


	 




	Apple’s
	requirement that beginning February 1, 2015 all new applications, and beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to
	existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 software development
	kit, could harm our business. 




	 


	If we acquire an asset
	that is incompatible with Apple’s requirement, we may have to expend more resources to update and port such an acquisition.
	In the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple informed developers that beginning on February 1, 2015 all new applications, and
	beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support
	and be built with the iOS 8 software development kit.    If we fail to implement 64-bit support for any of
	our existing games or assets or those that will undergo redevelopment that we intend to launch, it would negatively impact our
	revenues in 2016 and potentially beyond.  In addition, due to the expense involved in supporting 64-bit development,
	we may have difficulty in locating and acquiring compatible assets to add to our portfolio which will adversely affect revenues
	more quickly than they otherwise would have.  Furthermore, building our games to support 64-bit development will increase
	the file size of our games, which could reduce the number of downloads of these games, particularly if we are unable to keep the
	size of the games below 100 megabytes, which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier’s
	wireless network.


	 




	If we fail to successfully promote and
	maintain our brand, our business could be materially adversely affected



	.




	 



	We believe that broad brand recognition and
	a favorable consumer perception of our brand identity and website are essential to our future success. Accordingly, we intend to
	initiate a substantial advertising and marketing campaign to establish our brand.


	 


	If we fail to successfully promote and maintain
	our brand, incur significant expenses in promoting our brand and fail to generate a corresponding increase in revenue as a result
	of our branding efforts, or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand name, our business could be
	materially adversely affected. In addition, even if brand identity and Website recognition increases, the number of new customers
	or the number of sales or average dollars per sale may not increase, which could negatively affect our financial performance.


	 


	We must complete the development of our website
	and continually improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our products and services in order to maintain our consumer
	base. We may not succeed in developing features, functions, products or services that end-consumers find attractive. This could
	reduce the number potential buyers using our website and materially adversely affect our business.


	 




	Because we have a limited history of
	operations we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.




	 


	As a development stage company, we have less
	than one year of operational history in our industry. Accordingly, our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the establishment
	of a new business enterprise, including access to capital, successful implementation of our business plan, and no revenue from
	operations. We cannot assure you that our intended activities or plan of operation will be successful or result in revenue or profit
	to us and any failure to implement our business plan may have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.


	 




	If we fail to effectively manage our
	growth, our business, brand and reputation, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.





	 



	We may experience a rapid growth in operations,
	which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to
	grow, we must effectively identify, integrate, develop and motivate new employees, and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate
	culture. To attract top talent, we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages. The risks of over-hiring or
	over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability.


	 


	Additionally, if we do not effectively manage
	our growth, the quality of our services portfolio offerings could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, brand and
	reputation, results of operations and financial condition. If operational, technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented
	successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be




	15




	 




	impaired and we may have to make significant
	additional expenditures to address these issues. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational,
	financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures.


	 


	This will require that we refine our information
	technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees
	effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers. These system enhancements and improvements will require
	significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail
	to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with
	the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses.



	 





	We depend heavily on key personnel, and
	turnover of key senior management could harm our business.




	 


	Our future business and results of operations
	depend, in significant part, upon the continued contributions of our Chief Executive Officer. If we lose his services or if he
	fails to perform in his current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business
	could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our
	existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the product acquisition,
	marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future

	.



	 




	Our management has not had experience
	in managing the day to day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may incur additional expenses associated with the
	management of our company.




	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Mahoney, is
	responsible for the operations and reporting of our company. The requirements of operating as a small public company are new to
	our management. This may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals
	that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting
	requirements. We anticipate that the costs associated with SEC requirements associated with going and staying public are estimated
	to be approximately $25,000 in connection with this registration statement and thereafter $25,000 annually. If we lack cash resources
	to cover these costs in the future, our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could
	negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations, cash flow and financial condition after
	we commence operations.


	 




	Our future results and reputation
	may be affected by litigation or other liability claims.




	 


	We have not procured a general liability insurance
	policy for our business. To the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by general liability, we
	would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment
	against us. Adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our business or our securities.


	 




	If the use of
	smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase, our business
	could be adversely affected.




	 


	While the number of
	people using mobile Internet-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past few
	years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging, and it may not grow as we anticipate.  Our
	future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games.  The proliferation
	of mobile devices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile Internet-enabled
	devices as a platform for games.  In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our
	games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation
	platforms. 


	 




	Our business is subject to increasing
	governmental regulation. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.




	 


	We are subject to
	a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business.  Not only are these laws constantly evolving,
	which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced
	that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.  In the United States, for example, numerous
	federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of




	16




	 




	games.  Legislation
	has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors.  If
	such legislation is adopted, it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting
	the size of the potential market for our games.  


	 


	We may also be required
	to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could
	be costly or delay the release of our games.  In particular, free-to-play games have been subject to such legislation
	and public policy concerns already. For example, the United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading issued new principles in January
	2014 relating to in-app purchases in free-to-play games that are directed towards children 16 and under, which principles became
	effective in April 2014.  In response to a request made by the European Commission, Google has announced that it will
	no longer label free-to-play games as free in European Union countries.  Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple
	changed its label for free-to-download applications from 

	“FREE”

	 to 

	“GET”

	 in
	the Apple App Store.  


	 


	The Federal Trade
	Commission has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games
	that are marketed primarily to minors; the Federal Trade Commission recently reached settlement agreements with Apple and Google
	on this subject.  If the Federal Trade Commission issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases,
	it would significantly impact our business strategy.  


	 


	Furthermore, the growth
	and development of free-to-play gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws
	that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of this industry
	will increase and that we will be required to devote resources to addressing such regulation.  For example, existing
	laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or
	goods.  If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators,
	the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements which could significantly increase our operating
	costs.  


	 


	Finally, because our
	services may be available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their
	laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.



	 





	We may be subject to regulatory inquiries,
	claims, suits prosecutions which may impact our profitability.




	 


	Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply
	with applicable laws and regulations, in general, may subject us to regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions. We can
	give no assurance that we will prevail in such regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions on commercially reasonable
	terms or at all. Responding to, defending and/or settling regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions may be time-consuming
	and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business. A negative outcome in any of these
	proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services, potential liabilities or additional costs that
	could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.


	 




	We are subject to complex federal, state,
	local and other laws and regulations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
	operations.




	 


	Our business is subject to various, and sometimes
	complex, laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain
	and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may
	incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations.


	 


	In addition, our costs of compliance may increase
	if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.
	These costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover,
	our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 




	Any change to government regulation/administrative
	practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.




	 


	The laws, regulations, policies or current
	administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction,
	may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business.
	The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any




	17




	 




	government body or regulatory agency, or other
	special interest groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our
	ability to operate and/or our profitably.


	 




	We have not generated any revenues and
	are dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business. If we do not the sell shares in this offering we may
	have to seek alternative financing to complete our business or abandon them.





	 



	We have not generated any revenues and have
	limited capital resources. To date, the Company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated any cash from
	operations. Our current cash balance is not sufficient to sustain our operations for any period of time. Unless the company begins
	to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, we may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such
	liquidity and solvency problems may force us to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative
	sources of funds are available to the Company in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this offering. We require a
	minimum amount of $50,000 in net proceeds from this offering to satisfy operating requirements for the next twelve months.


	 


	 




	If our estimates related to expenditures
	and cash flow from operations are erroneous, or we are unable to sell additional equity securities, our business could fall short
	of expectations and you may lose your entire investment.




	 


	Our financial success is dependent in part
	upon the accuracy of our management's estimates of expenditures and cash flow from operations. If such estimates are erroneous
	or inaccurate, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could, in a worst-case scenario, result in the failure
	of our business and you losing your entire investment.


	 




	Our business may be harmed by future intellectual property
	right claims or disputes.




	 


	We may receive in the future, communications
	alleging that certain items listed or sold through our company or within one of our applications or a digital storefront infringe
	third-party copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights. These and future claims could result
	in increased costs of doing business through legal expenses, adverse judgment or settlement or require us to change our business
	practices in expensive ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that require us to change our business
	practices or otherwise increase our costs.


	 




	The laws and
	regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with
	these laws and regulations could harm our business.




	 


	We are subject to
	federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users, which
	laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  The U.S. government, including
	the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting
	information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices.   Various government and consumer agencies
	have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices.   


	 


	If we do not follow
	existing laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators, with respect to privacy-related matters,
	or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices, even if unfounded, it could damage our reputation and operating
	results.


	 


	All of potential games
	or software programs we choose to acquire will likely be subject to our privacy policy and a terms of service.  If we
	fail to comply with a posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy-related laws and regulations, including with respect to
	the information we collect from users of our games, it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others,
	which could harm our business.  In addition, interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry
	is often unclear.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country,
	or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with
	these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Further, if we
	fail to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data, it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and
	ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.


	 


	In the area of information
	security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for
	personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum
	information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  Costs to comply with these
	laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation.  Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these
	laws may subject us to significant liabilities.  


	 




	18




	 




	Security measures
	that we put in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees, customers and partners could be breached
	due to cyber-attacks initiated by third party hackers, employee error or malfeasance, or otherwise.  Because the techniques
	used to obtain unauthorized access, to disable or degrade service or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized
	until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  Any
	breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in
	significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data, which
	could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.


	 


	 




	We may be liable if third parties misappropriate our customers'
	personal information.




	 


	If third parties are able to penetrate our
	network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers' personal information or credit card information, or if we give third
	parties improper access to our customers' personal information or credit card information, we could be subject to liability. This
	liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims.
	This liability could also include claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes.


	 


	These claims could result in litigation. Liability
	for misappropriation of this information could adversely affect our business. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state
	agencies have been investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal information. We could incur additional
	expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate our
	privacy practices.


	We rely on encryption and authentication technology
	licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential
	information such as customer credit card numbers. We cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries
	in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we
	use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could harm our reputation, business,
	prospects, financial condition and results of operations. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate
	proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources
	to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. We cannot assure you that our security
	measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not harm our business, prospects,
	financial condition and results of operations.



	 





	If we fail to
	maintain and enhance our capabilities for porting games to a broad array of mobile devices, particularly those running the Android
	operating system, our revenues and financial results could suffer. 




	 


	We will derive the
	majority of our revenues from the sale of virtual goods within our games for smartphones and tablets that run Apple’s iOS
	or Google’s Android operating system.  Unlike the Apple ecosystem in which Apple controls both the device (iPhone,
	iPod Touch and iPad) and the storefront (Apple’s App Store), the Android ecosystem is highly fragmented since a large number
	of OEMs manufacture and sell Android-based devices that run a variety of versions of the Android operating system, and there are
	many Android-based storefronts in addition to the Google Play Store.  For us to sell our games to the widest possible
	audience of Android users, we must comport our games to a significant portion of the more than 1,000 Android-based devices that
	are commercially available, many of which have different technical requirements.  Since the number of Android-based smartphones
	and tablets shipped worldwide is growing significantly, it is important that we maintain and enhance our porting capabilities,
	which could require us to invest considerable resources in this area.  These additional costs could harm our business,
	operating results and financial condition.  In addition, we must continue to increase the efficiency of our porting processes
	or it may take us longer to port games to an equivalent number of devices, which would negatively impact our margins.  If
	we fail to maintain or enhance our porting capabilities, our revenues and financial results could suffer.



	 





	We depend upon third-party servicers
	to deliver our products to our customers on a timely and consistent basis.





	 




	We will rely
	upon multiple third parties for the development and enhancement of our portfolio of products. A deterioration in our relationship
	with any one of these third parties could decrease our ability to track shipments, cause shipment delays, and increase our shipping
	costs and the number of damaged products.




	Because
	we may not have a written long-term agreement with any of these third parties, we cannot be sure that these relationships will
	continue on terms favorable to us, if at all. If our relationships with these third parties are terminated or impaired or if these
	third parties are unable to deliver products for us, whether through labor shortage, slow down or stoppage, deteriorating financial
	or business condition or for any other reason, we would be required to use alternative servicers. We may be unable to engage alternative
	carriers on a timely basis





	19




	 




	or upon terms favorable to us. Changing servicers
	would likely have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.


	 


	 




	Real or perceived errors, failures
	or bugs in our software could impact our reputation, and as a result, adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.




	Because the
	technology that we acquire or develop for our mobile applications is complex, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur, especially
	when new versions or updates of our applications are released. Any errors, failures or bugs that impact the usability of our applications
	may cause customer dissatisfaction. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs, including installation errors or policies established
	by our customers, could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance, and loss of competitive position.
	Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions,
	delays or cessation of sales, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating
	results and growth prospects.


	 



	 





	Risks Related to Our Common Stock




	 




	Due to the lack of a current public market for our stock,
	investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase




	 


	Prior to this Offering, no public trading market
	existed for the Company’s securities. There can be no assurance that a public trading market for the Company’s common
	stock will develop or that a public trading market, if develop, will be sustained. The common stock sold pursuant to this prospectus
	will be freely tradable, however will not be eligible for quotation on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. We intend, upon the
	effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, to engage a market maker to apply for quotation
	on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.


	 


	There can be no assurance that a market maker
	will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. Thus, it is anticipated
	that there will be little or no market for the Shares until the Company is eligible to have its common stock quoted on the OTC
	Electronic Bulletin Board and as a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder. Because
	there is none and may be no public market for the Company’s stock, the Company may not be able to secure future equity financing
	which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.


	 


	Furthermore, when and if the Company’s
	common stock is eligible for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, there can also be no assurance as to the depth or
	liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares.


	 


	As a result, investors could find it more difficult
	to trade, or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of, the stock as compared to securities that are traded on the NASDAQ
	trading market or on an exchange. Moreover, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any Shares purchased hereunder.


	 




	Investors may have difficulty in reselling
	their shares due to the lack of market or state Blue Sky laws.




	 


	Our common stock is currently not quoted on
	any market. No market may ever develop for our common stock, or if developed, may not be sustained in the future.


	 


	The holders of our shares of common stock and
	persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant
	state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful in having the
	Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities to be a
	limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits
	a "manual exemption." This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being
	registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state.


	 


	 


	However, it is not enough for the security
	to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's
	balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent
	fiscal year of operations.  We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information.  Furthermore,
	the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading




	20




	 




	transactions, making it unavailable for issuers
	selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service,
	Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals.


	 


	A smaller number of states declare that they
	“recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions
	and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South
	Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.


	Accordingly, our shares should be considered
	totally illiquid, which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares.



	 





	We will be subject to penny stock regulations
	and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.




	 


	The SEC has adopted regulations which generally
	define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise
	price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions.  We anticipate that our common stock will become a
	“penny stock”, and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”.
	This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established
	customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser
	and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the
	ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the
	secondary market.


	 


	For any transaction involving a penny stock,
	unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the
	SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer
	and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent
	disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.


	 


	We do not anticipate that our common stock
	will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule,
	we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from
	participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.


	 




	Sales of our common stock under Rule
	144 could reduce the price of our stock.




	 



	There are zero
	(0) shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates and 5,000,000 shares held by affiliates that Rule 144 of the Securities Act
	of 1933 defines as restricted securities.




	1,000,000 newly
	issued shares may be registered in this offering, however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions
	of Rule 144.  In general, persons holding restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period
	of at least six months, may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and
	must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price.  The availability for sale of substantial
	amounts of common stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities.



	 




	Because we do not have an audit or compensation
	committee, shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors, none of which are independent, to perform these functions.




	 


	We do not have an audit or compensation committee
	comprised of independent directors.  Indeed, we do not have any audit or compensation committee.  These functions
	are performed by the board of directors as a whole.  No members of the board of directors are independent directors.  Thus,
	there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning
	management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.


	 


	 




	Our Chief Executive Officer and Director
	owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect
	certain corporate actions


	.


	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Tom
	Mahoney, owns all of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, currently, and after the offering, he will possess a significant
	influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions.
	Their ownership and control may also have the effect of




	21




	 




	delaying or preventing a future change in control,
	impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender
	offer.


	 




	There may not be funds available for
	net income because our Chief Executive Officer and Director maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and
	perquisites.




	 


	Our CEO Tom Mahoney, owns all of our outstanding
	voting securities. As a result, there may not be funds available for net income because he maintains significant control and can
	determine his own salary and perquisites.


	 




	We may, in the future, issue additional
	shares of common stock, which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.




	 


	Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the
	issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock.  As of the date of this prospectus the Company had 5,000,000
	shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 95,000,000 shares of common stock. The future
	issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders.
	We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions
	or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse
	effect on any trading market for our common stock.


	 




	We are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes
	us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights.




	 


	We may offer to sell our common stock to investors
	pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state
	securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon
	our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may not seek any legal opinion
	to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we may elect to
	relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investor themselves.


	 


	If any such offering did not qualify for such
	exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible that if
	an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those states where
	the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification
	provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful in
	seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally,
	if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties
	imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies.


	 




	Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions
	of Wyoming state law hinder a potential takeover of the Company.




	 


	Though not now, we may be or in the future
	we may become subject to Wyoming’s control share law. A corporation is subject to Wyoming’s control share law if it
	has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Wyoming, and it does business
	in Wyoming or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which
	means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise
	the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than
	one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power
	may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.


	The effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only
	such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a
	special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by
	the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once
	those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring
	person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the
	buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share
	law. If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or
	more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of
	voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder’s shares.




	22




	 




	 


	Wyoming’s control share law may have
	the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation.


	In addition
	to the control share law, Wyoming has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Wyoming
	corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes
	an “interested stockholder,” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance.
	For purposes of Wyoming law, an “interested stockholder” is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or
	indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate
	or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
	of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business
	combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use
	the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of
	the corporation and its other stockholders.


	The effect of Wyoming’s
	business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the Company from doing so if it cannot
	obtain the approval of our board of directors.


	 




	There is no current established trading
	market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop, purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their
	shares.




	 


	There is currently no established public trading
	market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained.  While
	we intend to seek a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, there can be no assurance that any such trading market will develop, and
	purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so. No market makers have committed
	to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so.


	 




	Because we do not have an escrow account
	or trust account for our investor's subscriptions, if we file for bankruptcy protection or are forced into bankruptcy protection,
	investors will lose their entire investment.




	 


	Invested funds for this offering will not be
	placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy
	is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy
	laws. As such, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for the sourcing
	and sale of promotional products. 


	 


	.




	The offering price
	of $0.20 per share is arbitrary.





	The
	Offering price of $0.20 per share has been arbitrarily determined by our management and does not bear any relationship to the assets,
	net worth or projected earnings of the Company or any other generally accepted criteria of


	value.





	We have no firm commitments
	to purchase any shares.





	We
	have no firm commitment for the purchase of any shares. Therefore there is no assurance that a trading market will develop or be
	sustained. The Company has not engaged a placement agent or broker for the sale of the shares. The Company may be unable to identify
	investors to purchase the shares


	.



	 




	Because we are a “shell company” the holders of
	our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on Rule 144 and we cannot file registration statements
	under Section 5 of the Securities Act using a Form S-8, until we cease being a “shell company”




	 


	We are a 

	“shell company”

	 as
	that term is defined by the applicable federal securities laws.  Specifically, because of the nature and amount of our assets
	and our very limited operations, pursuant to applicable federal rules, we are considered a 

	“shell company”

	.
	 Applicable provisions of Rule 144 specify that during that time that we are a 

	“shell company”

	 and
	for a period of one year thereafter, holders of our restricted securities can not sell those securities in reliance on Rule 144.
	This restriction may have potential adverse effects on future efforts to form additional capital through unregistered offerings.
	Another implication of us being a shell company is that we cannot file registration statements under Section 5 of the Securities
	Act using a Form S-8, a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee
	benefit plan. As result, one year after we cease being a shell company, assuming we are current in our reporting requirements with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission and have filed current

	“Form 10 information”

	 with the SEC reflecting
	our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than 12 months, holders of our restricted securities
	may then sell those securities in reliance on Rule 144 (provided, however, those holders satisfy all of the




	23




	 





	applicable requirements
	of that rule). For us to cease being a 

	“shell company”

	 we must have more than nominal operations and
	more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents. 

	Shares
	purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares if and when applicable restrictions
	against resale expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. 


	 


	 




	A low market price
	would severely limit the potential market for our common stock.





	Our
	common stock is expected to trade at a price substantially below $5.00 per share, subjecting trading in the stock to certain SEC
	rules requiring additional disclosures by broker-dealers. These rules generally apply to any non-NASDAQ equity security that has
	a market price share of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions (a “penny stock”). Such rules require
	the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated
	therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established
	customers and institutional or wealthy investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability
	determination


	for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent
	to the transaction prior to the sale. The broker –


	dealer also must disclose
	the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is
	the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market.
	Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to
	the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information
	on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements could discourage
	broker-


	dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock.





	Because we do not intend to pay any cash
	dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.




	 


	We intend to retain any future earnings to
	finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the
	foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they
	sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired.


	 




	Opt-in right for emerging growth company




	 


	We have elected to use the extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under


	 


	Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows
	us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies
	until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable
	to companies that comply with public company effective dates.



	 





	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth
	Company.




	As a company with less than $1.0 billion in
	revenue during its last fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long
	as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory
	requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies.  These provisions include:


	 




	 



	-




	A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management's Discussion and Analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal controls over financial reporting;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; an





	 




	 



	-




	reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company's executive compensation arrangements





	 




	24




	 




	An emerging growth company is also exempt from
	Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report
	on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Similarly, as
	a Smaller Reporting Company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and our independent registered public accounting
	firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until such time
	as we cease being a Smaller Reporting Company.


	  


	Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an
	emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act
	for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
	of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.  We have elected to take
	advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.  Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to
	those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.


	 


	We may use these provisions until the last
	day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering. However, if certain events
	occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a 

	“large accelerated filer,”

	 our
	annual gross revenue exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we
	will cease to be anemerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period.


	 




	You may have limited access to information
	regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the SEC could be automatically suspended under certain
	circumstances.  




	 


	 


	As of effectiveness of our registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part, we will be required to file periodic reports with the SEC which will be immediately available
	to the public for inspection and copying (see “Where You Can Find More Information” elsewhere in this prospectus).
	 


	 


	Except during the year that our registration
	statement becomes effective, these reporting obligations may (in our discretion) be automatically suspended under Section 15(d)
	of the Exchange Act if we have less than 300 shareholders and do not file a registration statement on Form 8A (which we have no
	current plans to file).  If this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective, we will no longer
	be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted.
	 After this registration statement on Form S-1 becomes effective, we will be required to deliver periodic reports to security
	holders.


	 


	However, we will not be required to furnish
	proxy statements to security holders and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report
	their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Previously, a company with
	more than 500 shareholders of record and $10 million in assets had to register under the Exchange Act.  However, the JOBS
	Act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from 500 to either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not "accredited investors"
	(or 2,000 persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies).  The JOBS Act excludes securities received by employees
	pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold.  This means that access
	to information regarding our business and operations will be limited.


	 




	Upon effectiveness of this registration
	statement, we will be subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which does not require
	a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting companies.




	 


	Upon effectiveness of this registration statement,
	we will be subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a Section 15(d) filer,
	we will be required to file quarterly and annual reports during the fiscal year in which our registration statement is declared
	effective; however, such duty to file reports shall be suspended as to any fiscal year, other than the fiscal year within which
	such registration statement became effective, if, at the beginning of such fiscal year the securities of each class are held of
	record by less than 300 persons.  In addition, as a filer subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we are not required
	to prepare proxy or information statements; our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations;
	we will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules; our officers, directors, and more than ten (10%) percent
	shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company; that these persons will
	not be subject to the short-swing profit recovery provisions of the Exchange Act; and that more than five percent (5%)
	holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities.
	As such, shareholders will not have access to




	25




	 




	certain material information which would otherwise
	be required if it was a fully reporting company pursuant to an Exchange Act registration


	 




	If we are not required to continue filing
	reports under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the future, for example because we have less than three hundred
	shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective, and we do
	not file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A, our common shares (if listed or quoted) would no longer be eligible for quotation,
	which could reduce the value of your investment.




	 



	As a result of
	this offering as required under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission as required under Section 15(d). However, if in the future we are not required to continue filing reports
	under Section 15(d), for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal
	year in which this registration statement is declared effective, and we do not file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A upon the
	occurrence of such an event, our common stock can no longer be quoted on the OTC Markets OTC Link, which could reduce the value
	of your investment.  Of course, there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the requirements to be able to cease filing
	reports under Section 15(d), in which case we will continue filing those reports in the years after the fiscal year in which this
	registration statement is declared effective.  Filing a registration statement on Form 8-A will require us to continue to
	file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC.  In addition, our officers,
	directors and 10% stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity.


	 




	 



	 






	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten
	basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.20. The
	total offering amount is $200,000. We do not intend to employ any material amount of the contemplated offering to discharge any
	current or future indebtedness of the Company. Moreover, we do not intend to use any proceeds of the offering to acquire any significant
	assets of or acquire any entity.


	The following table sets forth the uses
	of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There

	The above figures represent only estimated
	costs. This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business
	conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
	status of and results from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
	proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes,
	and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will
	need to secure additional funding for the fully implement our business plan.


	 


	In the event we are not successful in
	selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:




	 



	-




	for general administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the SEC;





	 




	 



	-




	for office lease expenses and office equipment;





	 




	 



	-




	for sales and marketing;





	 




	 



	-




	for salaries for our Chief Executive Officer and the hiring of additional full-time employees; and





	 




	 



	-




	for consultants and developers’ salaries and wages.





	Our current corporate offices are located at
	1360 Little Duck Circle, Gulf Breeze, FL 32563. If we are able to raise sufficient capital through this offering, we will seek
	to lease a larger, dedicated space at no more than $2,500 per month.



	 




	DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE



	Our management has determined the offering
	price for the common shares being sold in this offering. The price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined. The
	offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. The factors considered
	were:




	 



	-




	Our status as a developmental stage, “startup” company;





	 




	 



	-




	Prevailing market conditions, including the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;





	 




	 



	-




	Our forecasted future prospects; and





	 




	 



	-




	Our current capital structure.





	Therefore, the public offering price of the
	shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices that may
	prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock. You cannot be sure that a public market for
	any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering
	price in this offering. Such offering price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value, such as book value
	or earnings per share. Because we have no significant operating history, the price of our common stock is not based on past earnings,
	nor is the price of our common stock indicative of the current market value of the assets owned by us. No valuation or appraisal
	has been prepared for our business and potential business expansion. Our common stock is presently not traded on any market or
	securities exchange and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market. You cannot be sure that a public market
	for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering
	price in this offering.



	 


	 





	DILUTION



	If you purchase any of the shares offered by
	this prospectus, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price
	per share and the post-offering net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution
	results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable
	to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock. As of February 29, 2016, our net tangible book value was $(4,158)
	or $(0.000832) per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets
	(excluding deferred offering costs) less total liabilities, divided by 5,000,000, the number of shares of common stock outstanding
	at February 29, 2016.


	 


	The following table sets forth as of February
	29, 2016, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholder and
	by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 25%,

	of offering expenses, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $.20 per share of common stock.

	Assuming the Issuer sells the entire offering
	of 1,000,000 shares, after giving effect to the sale of common shares in this offering, and after deducting underwriting discounts
	and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our post-offering net tangible book value as of February 29, 2016
	would be $170,842, or $0.028 per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in the post-offering net tangible book value
	of $.029 per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the post-offering net tangible book value of approximately
	$.17 per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this offering. We determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted
	net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock.



	 





	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	This Prospectus relates to the sale of 1,000,000
	common shares.


	 


	We will sell the common shares ourselves and
	do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one
	has agreed to buy any of our common shares. This prospectus permits our officers and directors to sell the common shares directly
	to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any common shares they may sell. There is no plan or
	arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the common shares with a broker or dealer. Our officers and directors
	will sell the common shares and intend to offer them to friends, family members and business acquaintances. There is no minimum
	amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common shares will go into escrow, trust or another
	similar arrangement.


	 


	The common shares are being offered by Tom
	Mahoney, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director. Mr. Tom Mahoney will be relying on the safe harbor in Rule 3a4-1
	of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell the common shares. No sales commission will be paid for common shares sold by Tom
	Mahoney. Mr. Mahoney is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer.


	 


	Additionally, Mr. Mahoney primarily performs
	substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Mr. Mahoney has not
	been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding 12 months and they have not participated
	in selling an offering of securities for




	28




	 




	 


	any issuer more than once every 12 months other
	than in reliance on paragraph (a)4(i) or (a)4(iii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	The offering will terminate upon the earlier
	to occur of: (i) the sale of all 1,000,000 shares being offered, or (ii) 180 days after this registration statement is declared
	effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	There are no finders in this offering.


	 


	Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common stock
	is below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock will be subject to the "penny stock" rules and regulations. Broker-dealers
	who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the Commission’s regulations concerning the
	transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to:


	 


	- Make a suitability determination
	prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser;


	- Receive the purchaser’s
	written consent to the transaction; and


	- Provide certain written
	disclosures to the purchaser.


	 


	These requirements may restrict the ability
	of broker/dealers to sell our common stock, and may affect the ability to resell our common stock.



	 


	 


	 






	Market Information




	 


	There is no established public trading market
	for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may not be sustained. A shareholder in all likelihood,
	therefore, will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resales.
	Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular
	trading market develops.


	 




	OTC Electronic Bulletin Board Considerations




	 


	To be quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
	Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. We anticipate that
	after this registration statement is declared effective, market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities
	will thereafter trade on the OTC Bulletin Board.


	 


	The OTC Electronic Bulletin Board is separate
	and distinct from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin Board. The SEC’s order handling rules, which apply to NASDAQ-listed securities, do not apply to securities quoted
	on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.


	 


	Although the NASDAQ stock market has rigorous
	listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers, and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards, the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin Board has no listing standards. Rather, it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system, files the
	application, and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files. FINRA cannot deny an application
	by a market maker to quote the stock of a company. The only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer
	be current in its reporting requirements with the SEC.


	 


	Although we anticipate listing on the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock, investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it
	is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market, it initially will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board rather than on NASDAQ.
	Investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed. Trading activity in general
	is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with NASDAQ-listed securities.


	 


	Investors must contact a broker-dealer to trade
	OTC Electronic Bulletin Board securities. Investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service. For bulletin board
	securities, there only has to be one market maker.


	 


	 


	Bulletin board transactions are conducted almost
	entirely manually. Because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board, they are conducted via
	telephone. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this




	29




	 




	process may result in a significant increase
	in the time it takes to execute investor orders. Therefore, when investors place market orders - an order to buy or sell a specific
	number of shares at the current market price - it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the
	lapse of time between placing a market order and getting execution.


	 



	Because bulletin
	board stocks are usually not followed by analysts, there may be lower trading volume than for NASDAQ-listed securities.




	There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.




	 





	Blue Sky Law Considerations




	 


	The holders of our shares of common stock and
	persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant
	state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful in having the
	Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities to be a
	limited one. There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. We intend to seek coverage
	and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a "manual exemption”.
	This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing
	the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the
	security to be listed in a recognized manual.


	 



	The listing entry
	must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement
	for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. We may not be able to
	secure a listing containing all of this information. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption restricted to
	secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals
	are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports,
	and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals”
	but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize
	the manual exemption: AL, CA, IL, KY, LA, MT, NH, NY, PA, TN and VA


	.


	We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other
	states which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders

	.





	 





	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	 


	The following description as a summary of the
	material terms of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws have been
	filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.


	 




	Common Stock




	 


	We are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares
	of common stock with $0.001 par value per share. As of the date of this registration statement, there were 5,000,000 shares of
	common stock issued and outstanding held by one (1) shareholder, our Chief Executive Officer and Director.


	 


	Each share of common stock entitles the holder
	to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of shareholders. The holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively.
	Accordingly, the shareholders of our common stock who hold, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the total voting rights
	can elect all of our directors and, in such event, the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of
	such directors.


	 


	 


	The vote of the holders of a majority of the
	issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize, affirm, ratify or consent to
	such act or action, except as otherwise provided by law.


	 


	Holders of common stock are entitled to receive
	ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We have not paid any
	dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of our business.
	Any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things,
	our future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.


	 


	Holders of our common stock have no preemptive
	rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. Upon our liquidation, dissolution
	or windup, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to




	30




	 




	share ratably in the net assets legally available
	for distribution to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities. There are not any provisions in our
	Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control.


	 


	Upon completion of the offering, Cathedral
	Stock Transfer will act as the registrant's transfer agent.


	 




	Preferred Stock




	 


	By resolution of our
	majority shareholder, we may, without any further vote or action by our shareholders, amend our articles of incorporation to authorize
	and issue, subject to limitations prescribed by law, shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more
	classes or class. With respect to any classes or class, the Board may determine the designation and the number of shares, preferences,
	limitations and special rights, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and liquidation
	preferences. Because of the rights that may be granted, the issuance of preferred stock may delay, defer or prevent a change of
	control. Prior to this offering, we had no shares of preferred issued and outstanding.



	 






	Dividend Policy




	 


	We have never paid or declared any cash dividends
	on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend
	to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business. Any future determination
	to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including our results
	of operations, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other
	factors our board of directors deems relevant.




	 




	 



	 






	Share Eligible for Future Sale




	 


	Prior to this offering, there was no public
	market for our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability
	of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common
	stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to
	raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.


	  


	The 5,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding
	after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only
	if they have been registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.



	 





	Implication of the Applicability of Rule
	144




	 


	 


	Sales under the Rule 144 by our affiliates
	or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements
	and to the availability of current public information about us.


	 


	There are zero (0) shares of our common stock
	held by non-affiliates and five million (5,000,000) shares held by affiliates that Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 defines
	as restricted securities. Pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Rule 144”), a “shell
	company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely
	of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.


	 


	As such, because we have nominal assets and
	minimal operations, we are still considered a “shell company” pursuant to Rule 144 and as such, sales of our securities
	pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until we have ceased to be a “shell company” and we are subject to Section
	13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least
	the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to Rule 144; and a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the
	date “Form 10 information” (i.e., information similar to that which would be found in a Form 10 Registration Statement
	filing with the SEC

	 

	has been filed with the Commission reflecting the Company’s status as a non-“shell
	company.”

	Penny Stock Considerations




	 


	Our shares will be "penny stocks",
	as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00.
	Thus, our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in
	certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone
	other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's
	written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt.


	 


	In addition, under the penny stock regulations,
	the broker-dealer is required to:


	 




	 



	-




	Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;





	 




	 



	-




	Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;





	 




	 



	-




	Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer's account, the account's value, and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and





	 




	 



	-




	Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account.





	 


	Because of these regulations, broker-dealers
	may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our Common Stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders
	or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market, and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in
	the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if our
	securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease
	in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will,
	in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.

	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS




	 




	Overview:




	 


	The Company was incorporated under the laws
	of the State of Wyoming on August 4, 2015. We are a developmental stage company principally involved in the business of locating,
	acquiring, and turning around undervalued assets within the mobile gaming and patented small technologies sector. To identify potential
	acquisitions, we intend to look for assets that have not been marketed to the general public yet, have the ability to generate
	interest from the public, and have the potential to be monetized within a short time horizon. Since inception, we have generated
	an accumulated deficit in the amount $4,692.


	 




	Dessert Crush Saga:




	 


	Our initial acquisition, a mobile application
	called Dessert Crush Saga, has completed development. All source codes have been fully developed, and the product is ready for
	release. It is currently available on the iTunes App Store, and once we begin marketing the product, will be available in other
	marketplaces as well.


	 




	Industry Overview






	32




	 




	 


	The growth of the mobile entertainment market
	is being shaped by an intersection of trends in the wireless communications and entertainment industries since wireless carriers
	provide the primary marketing and distribution channel for mobile games and branded content owners provide the licensing relationships
	that facilitate creating a large and diverse portfolio of recognizable games


	 


	The mobile game market differs substantially
	from the traditional console game market. Mobile games typically have significantly lower development and distribution costs and
	longer life cycles than console games. Console game sales depend upon the product cycles of the consoles themselves, with large
	generational shifts between versions of each of the major console platforms every few years. In contrast, the mobile platform is
	characterized by a gradual evolution of features and capabilities in the many new handsets introduced each year by a large number
	of manufacturers and carriers. Consumers typically use their console games within the confines of their homes, while mobile games
	are available in all the settings where consumers take their mobile handsets. Furthermore, console games are usually developed
	for a few console platforms at most, which means that the development costs are mostly associated with the original creation and
	development of the game. However, once developed, mobile games may need to be ported to more than 1,000 different handset models,
	many with different technological requirements. Therefore, the ability to port mobile games quickly and cost effectively can be
	a competitive differentiator among mobile game publishers and a barrier to entry for other potential market entrants.


	 


	The networked nature of mobile games allows
	publishers the opportunity to improve the profitability of a game through decisions on porting, pricing, localization and marketing.
	Some games, especially those tied to films, television shows or console games with specific “day-and-date” launch requirements,
	ideally are launched simultaneously on a global basis with a large number of carriers. Other games may be launched in stages by
	regions or by carriers. These games require initial launch on fewer handsets than games with global “day-and-date”
	launch requirements. Games released in stages offer the opportunity to improve profitability by adjusting porting and marketing
	support costs based upon the initial success of the game.




	Growth Strategy




	The Company’s growth strategy involves
	active review of targeted mobile applications that have high-value elements and low barriers to acquisition. For example, Red Fish
	Holdings’ first acquisition was guided by the recent uptrend in production and popularity of match-three puzzle games within
	the mobile gaming sector. The high-value component being the quality and style of game-play. Vigilant research into ongoing trends,
	both operational and product trends as well as developing trends in marketing and revenue generating strategies will guide future
	growth.


	 


	Once targets are acquired, the Company will
	attempt to market the products into less expensive markets or less saturated markets than U.S.–only markets or social-media
	based platforms and markets like Facebook. Additionally, the Company will seek to expand market visibility of each application
	by ensuring compliance with listing and hosting requirements by Android digital fronts such as Google Play.


	 


	 


	Most mobile application offerings will follow
	a free-to-play model in which users may download the application and play for free with an option to upgrade to a premium version
	or engage in in-app purchases to extend or enhance game play. Such a strategy will seek to grow the user-base of each product offering
	and overall visibility of Red Fish Holdings within the mobile game markets and digital store fronts.



	 





	Market Opportunity:




	The 2015 Global Games Market Report by
	market research and predictive analytics firm Newzoo estimates the annual revenue in the global games market to be $91.5 billion.
	Newzoo further estimates that the worldwide games market will reach $113.3 billion by 2018. This represents a 2014 to 2018 

	Compound
	Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 

	of +7.9%. The market for (smart) phones and tablets will rise from $30.0 billion this year to
	$44.2 billion in 2018, ultimately taking 39% of the global games market. In 2015, China and the US are neck and neck for number
	one market, with China expected to outgrow the US by the smallest of margins: $22.2 billion versus $22.0 billion.


	 


	The Computer Screen (PC/Mac) with $41.2 billion
	will account for 36% of the market by 2018 and will remain the most revenue generating screen, growing at a robust CAGR of +6.9%
	driven primarily by PC/MMO games. The Entertainment Screen (TV/Console, VR) with $26.8 billion will have 24% of the market by 2018,
	down from 27% in 2015. Both the Computer Screen and the Entertainment Screen will lose a small portion of their share to the continuously
	growing Personal Screen (Phones, Smartwatches). In 2018, the Personal Screen with $30.2 billion will account for 27% of the pie,
	leaving 13% for the Floating Screen (Tablets, Handhelds). The decline of the handheld console market (CAGR of -22.5%) will be offset
	by the robust growth of tablet revenues (CAGR of +17.1%), resulting in the Floating Screen maintaining its market share




	33




	 




	towards 2018. It was estimated that in 2015,
	digital game revenues were going to account for 78% of the global market totaling $70.9 billion, up from a 74% share in 2014.


	 




	Target Market and Marketing Strategy


	:


	In order to effectively and efficiently market
	our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications in an effort to acquire new users, we will utilize a multi-faceted
	approach as follows:


	 



	-


	              


	Outreach to various technology, business, and gaming blogs and online publications.




	-


	              


	Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Cross Platform Advertising.




	-


	              


	Trade shows and other industry gatherings



	 


	The combination of these three marketing
	approaches will, in theory, provide optimal coverage for user acquisition. By utilizing three different approaches, we aim to keep
	our User Acquisition Cost at a lower average price than we would if we utilized only one or two strategies. In addition to keeping
	our User Acquisition Cost low, using multiple different approaches will allow us to better reach our target market of 14 –
	38 year olds as different segments of the target market are accessible via different technologies and advertising media. The three
	approaches are further outlined below:


	 


	Blog Outreach:




	 



	-




	Online blogs offer immense marketing opportunities. We will be able to specifically target blogs that write about Technology, Business, and Gaming. By contacting these bloggers to write a review about our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming appliactions, we can reach specific groups of people that might become potential customers at a lower price and at a much more effective rate than some other forms of advertising such as radio spots or newspaper advertisements.





	 


	Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Cross Platform
	Advertising:




	 



	-




	Pay-Per-Click (PPC) is a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. One of the most popular forms of PPC, search engine advertising, allows advertisers to bid for ad placement in a search engine’s sponsored links when someone searches on a keyword that is related to their business offering. Cross Platform advertising, in this case, is extending advertising and marketing efforts to mobile devices for inclusion in ‘in-app’ advertising. By utilizing both of these approaches, we can once again make an effort to keep customer acquisition cost lower by a) only paying for actual ‘clicks’ instead of impressions, and b) placing our advertising directly in front of people by placing advertising in apps on mobile devices.





	  


	Trade Shows and Industry Gatherings:




	 



	-




	By attending industry trade shows and industry gatherings we will be able to showcase our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications to our peers in the technology and gaming industries as well as raise awareness for future business to business (B2B) partnerships. B2B partnerships will offer opportunities for both new and existing companies in our industry to develop new products that will integrate seamlessly with our software platform. Partnerships such as these and others will offer our company even greater visibility to customers.





	 


	 






	Competition




	 


	Our primary industry competitors include Digital
	Chocolate, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, Hands-On Mobile, I-play, Namco and THQ, with Electronic Arts having the largest
	market share of any company in the mobile games market. In the future, likely competitors include major media companies, traditional
	video game publishers, content aggregators, mobile software providers and independent mobile game publishers. Wireless carriers
	may also decide to develop, internally or through a managed third-party developer, and distribute their own mobile games. If carriers
	enter the mobile game market as publishers, they might refuse to distribute some or all of our games or might deny us access to
	all or part of their networks.




	34




	 




	 


	The development, distribution and sale of mobile
	games is a highly competitive business. For end users, we compete primarily on the basis of brand, game quality and price. For
	carriers, we compete for deck placement based on these factors, as well as historical performance and perception of sales potential
	and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on
	royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth
	and relationships with carriers. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.


	 


	Some of our competitors’ and our potential
	competitors’ advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:


	 


		• 	significantly greater revenues
	and financial resources;


	 


		• 	stronger brand and consumer
	recognition regionally or worldwide;


	 




	 



	•




	the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;





	 




	 



	•




	more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;





	 




	 



	•




	pre-existing relationships with brand owners or carriers that afford them access to intellectual property while blocking the access of competitors to that same intellectual property;





	 


		• 	greater resources to make acquisitions;


	 


		• 	lower labor and development
	costs; and


	 


		• 	broader global distribution
	and presence.


	 


	Further, our capital resources limit the number
	of games that we can develop and market, and any inability to predict successfully the appropriate level of marketing investment
	in each game could result in lower earnings than we anticipate.


	 


	 




	Research & Development




	 


	Red Fish Holdings is not currently engaged
	in any research. Development of the apps, beyond what is currently available in our portfolio, will commence in the coming months.



	 





	Intellectual Property




	 


	The Company itself does not hold any intellectual
	property, besides for the use of its trade name.


	 




	Government Regulation




	 



	We do
	not believe we will require any government approval to sell our products.

	However, our services are subject to federal and
	state consumer protection laws within various jurisdictions throughout the world and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive
	trade practices. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct
	of our business.



	 






	Employees




	 


	We have one employee, our Chief Executive Officer
	Tom Mahoney. Mr. Mahoney spends at least 80 hours a month on the affairs of the company. We will hire necessary personnel based
	on an as-needed basis only and on a per-contract basis to be compensated directly from revenues

	.




	 






	Legal Proceedings






	35




	 




	 


	We know of no existing or pending legal proceedings
	against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of
	our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material
	interest adverse to our interest.



	 






	Properties




	 


	Our principal offices are located at 1360
	Little Duck Cir. Gulf Breeze, FL 32563. Mr. Mahoney personally owns this space and allows the company to operate out of it at
	no cost.


	 


	 



	DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS,
	AND CONTROL PERSONS



	 


	The board of directors elects our executive
	officers annually. A majority vote of the directors who are in office is required to fill vacancies. Each director shall be elected
	for the term of one year, and until her successor is elected and qualified, or until her earlier resignation or removal. Our directors
	and executive officers are as follows:


	 






	Name




	 




	Age




	 




	Position







	Tom Mahoney



	 



	55



	 



	Chief Executive Officer, Director





	 



	Tom Mahoney, Chief Executive Officer



	Tom Mahoney is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.


	 


	Thomas N. Mahoney, 55 years old, graduated
	with a B.A. in economics from San Diego State University in 1984. Mr. Mahoney acquired his series 7 NASD license and worked for
	Prudential-Bache Securities (now Prudential Securities) from 1985-1990. He was managing director for the MCM Group, a venture
	capital firm in La Jolla, CA helping finance and organize start-ups. Mr. Mahoney then worked for Amber Securities in Taipei, Taiwan
	from 1998-2000 to help run an overseas hedge fund. Upon arriving back from Asia, Mr. Mahoney was Managing Director for Equititrend
	Advisors from 2001-2013 and Carmel Advisors LLC from 2013-2014 providing investor relations and corporate finance to large and
	varied number of public companies.


	 


	 




	Code of Ethics Policy




	We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal
	executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.



	 





	Board Composition




	 


	Our Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors
	shall consist of no more than three (3) directors. Each director of the Company serves until his successor is elected and qualified,
	subject to removal by the Company’s majority shareholders. Each officer shall hold their offices for such terms and shall
	exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, and shall hold his office until
	his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation or removal.




	 






	Potential Conflicts of Interest





	Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been
	performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors
	and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management
	decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.




	Director Independence





	Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material
	relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his




	36




	 




	responsibilities. As a result of this
	review, our board of directors determined that our directors do not meet the independence requirements, according to the applicable
	rules and regulations of the SEC.




	Corporate Governance




	There have been no changes in any state
	law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having no nominating
	committee for that purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert. Based on the
	fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs.




	Family Relationships




	None.




	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings




	 


	No officer, director, or persons nominated for such positions,
	promoter or significant employee has been involved in the last ten years in any of the following:




	 



	•




	Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time,





	 




	 



	•




	Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses),





	 




	 



	•




	Being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities,





	 




	 



	•




	Being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.





	 




	 



	•




	Having any government agency, administrative agency, or administrative court impose an administrative finding, order, decree, or sanction against them as a result of their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity.





	 




	 



	•




	Being the subject of a pending administrative proceeding related to their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity.





	 




	 



	•




	Having any administrative proceeding been threatened against you related to their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity.







	 






	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



	 


	Since inception, we have not paid any compensation
	to our officers or directors. We may elect to award a cash bonus to key employees, directors, officers and consultants based on
	meeting individual and corporate planned objectives.


	 


	We do not have any standard arrangements by
	which directors are compensated for any services provided as a director. No cash has been paid to the directors in their capacity
	as such.



	 





	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
	OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT



	 


	The following tables set forth the ownership,
	as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of
	our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge,
	the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any
	pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.


	 


	The information presented below regarding beneficial
	ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
	is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial
	owner" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose
	or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed




	37




	 




	to own beneficially any security as to which
	such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise
	of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the
	same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number
	of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire
	voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares
	as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used
	for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable
	community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment
	power with respect to the shares shown. The business address of the shareholders is 1360 Little Duck Cir. Gulf Breeze, FL 32563

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
	OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	The following discussion of our financial condition
	and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial
	information included in this Form S-1. Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical
	facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky.


	 


	These risks and uncertainties include international,
	national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to
	successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes
	in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or
	suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business
	disruptions; the ability to attract and retain

	qualified personnel; the ability to protect
	technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filing
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	Although the forward-looking statements in
	this Registration Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors
	currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties,
	the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.
	You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we
	attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of
	operations and prospects.


	 




	Overview




	 


	We are a developmental stage company principally
	involved in the business of marketing and developing mobile gaming applications to the public. Since inception, we have generated
	no revenue against total expenses of $4,692 for a net loss in the amount of ($4,692). Our expenses are primarily attributed to
	general and administrative expenses as well as those related to the organization of the Company and this offering. We have generated
	an accumulated deficit in the amount of ($4,692) for the period ending February 29, 2016.


	 




	Plan of Operations




	 


	 


	Our plan of operations for the next twelve
	(12) months is as follows:


	 



	Execute capital raise: Months 3




	 



	Estimated Cost: $26,021


	 



	Acquire, develop and launch mobile applications,
	mobile gaming applications and website: Months 6-12



	 


	Acquire mobile applications and mobile gaming
	applications that are already in existence and under-value, hire contractor(s) to further develop our portfolio of mobile applications
	and mobile gaming applications, as well as launch new mobile applications and mobile gaming applications. Develop software and
	purchase appropriate hardware to maintain a network and server.


	 


	Estimated Cost: $100,000


	 



	Market mobile gaming applications: Months
	9-12



	 


	Marketing the mobile applications and mobile
	gaming applications that we develop is the key component of our growth strategy. This will involve developing and launching a multi-faceted
	online campaign that will incorporate the latest trends in online marketing: web content, ad targeting, and social media engagement.


	 


	Estimated Costs: $73,979


	 




	Results of Operations




	 



	Our cash balance
	is $143 as of the period ending February 29, 2016 with $5,035 in liabilities. Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited
	levels of operations for any period of time without further revenue or proceeds from this offering. We may utilize funds from Mr.
	Mahoney our Chief Executive Officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs,
	filing fees, and professional fees. Mr. Mahoney, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance
	or loan funds to the company. In order to sustain our operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum of $50,000
	of funding from this offering. After the initial twelve-month period we may need additional financing. We do not currently have
	any arrangements for additional financing.




	We
	incurred expenses of $4,692 which is mainly comprised of professional fees including: legal ($2,500) and accounting ($2,000) fees.
	This constitutes an aggregate loss of $4,692. The maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement
	our business plan.



	 




	39




	 




	If we do not receive any proceeds from the
	offering, we may be compelled to seek a loan from Mr. Mahoney, who has informally agreed to advance us funds. However, he has no
	formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company.


	 


	To meet our need for cash we are attempting
	to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this
	offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional
	cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations
	until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely.


	 




	Purchase and Sale of Equipment




	 


	We presently have no equipment.


	 




	Income & Operation Taxes




	 


	We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.


	 




	Net Loss




	 


	We incurred net losses of $4,692 for the period
	from inception to February 29, 2016.


	  




	Development Stage and Capital Resources




	 


	Since its inception, the Company has devoted
	substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and staff and raising capital.
	Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage. The Company has generated no revenues from operations and
	therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves.


	 


	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed
	with our plan of operation. In order to sustain our operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum of $50,000
	of funding from this offering. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 months
	financial requirement. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section
	of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation.


	 


	While we have no revenues as of this date,
	no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our full plan
	of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand per our business plan. The minimum amount of the
	offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs
	with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company
	will be approximately $25,000.


	 


	We are highly dependent upon the success of
	this offering, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources
	such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because
	we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high
	risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the
	terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities,
	or secure a loan, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment.


	 


	Additionally, the Company will have to meet
	all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s
	management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements,
	especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management
	could limit the amount of time management has to implement the business plan and may impede the speed of its operations.

	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION




	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant as provided
	in the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
	person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
	PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	The Board of Directors and Shareholders


	Red Fish Holdings Incorporated:


	I have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
	Red Fish Holdings Incorporated, (the “Company”) as of February 29, 2016 and the related statements of operations,
	stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the period of August 4, 2015 (Inception), though the period ended February 29, 2016.
	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on my audit.


	I conducted my audits in accordance with the standards
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. I was not engaged to perform
	an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. My audit included consideration of internal control over financial
	reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
	an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


	Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.


	In my opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Red Fish Holdings Incorporated as of February 29,
	2016 and the results of its operations and cash flows the period of August 4, 2015 (Inception) through the period ended February
	29, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
	statements, the Company has suffered losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial
	doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described
	in Note 9. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	RED FISH HOLDINGS







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 



	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION


	 



	 


	Red Fish Holdings is a Wyoming corporation
	(the “Company”), incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on August 4, 2015. The business plan of the Company
	is to acquire and develop mobile applications as well as assets in the small patented technologies industry.


	 



	Basis of Presentation




	 



	The Company maintains its accounting records
	on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).


	 


	These financial statements are presented in
	US dollars.


	 



	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES



	 



	The principal accounting policies are set
	out below, these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented, unless otherwise stated:



	 



	Fiscal Year End




	 



	The Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end
	of December 31.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.


	 



	Going concern



	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
	liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of February 29, 2016, the Company had a loss from operations of
	$4,692 and earned no revenues since inception and has a working capital deficit of $4,192. The Company intends to fund operations
	through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash
	requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company is dependent upon, among other
	things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems,
	management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.


	 


	These factors, among others, raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	Cash and equivalents include investments with
	initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that
	are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000.


	 



	Property, Plant and Equipment



	On August 30, 2015 the Company acquired Dessert
	Crush Saga, a mobile gaming application, for $700. The funds used to purchase the application were advanced to the Company by our
	Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Mahoney.


	 



	Accounts payable and accrued expenses



	Accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried
	at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year
	that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and
	services.


	 




	49




	 





	Earnings per share



	The Company computes net loss per share in
	accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
	(“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to
	common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is
	determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares, which comprise options granted to employees. As at February
	29, 2016, the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The Company measures assets and liabilities
	at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents
	the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction
	between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
	or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value
	on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.


	 


	The following are the hierarchical levels of
	inputs to measure fair value:


	- Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets
	for identical instruments;


	- Level 2: Other significant observable inputs
	(including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);


	- Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs
	(including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).


	 



	Contingent Liability



	Where contingent milestone payments are due
	to third parties the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.


	 



	Income taxes



	Income taxes are accounted for in accordance
	with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
	and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for
	deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
	be realized.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
	Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation ("ASUE
	2014-10"). The guidance is intended to reduce the overall cost and complexity associated with financial reporting for development
	stage entities without reducing the availability of relevant information. The Board also believes the changes will simplify the
	consolidation accounting guidance by removing the differential accounting requirements for development stage entities. As a result
	of these changes, there no longer will be any accounting or reporting differences in GAAP between development stage entities and
	other operating entities. For organizations defined as public business entities the presentation and disclosure requirements in
	Topic 915 will no longer be required starting with the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim
	periods therein. Early application is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial
	statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). The Company has
	elected to adopt this guidance as of August 4, 2015.


	 



	Share based payments



	 


	The Company accounts for the issuance of equity
	instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity
	instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments
	issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB. The
	measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment
	for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete.
	In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of
	the consulting agreement.

	NOTE 3 – RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING
	PRONOUNCEMENTS



	During the period ended February 29, 2016,
	the Company has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
	(Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to remove the
	inception to date information and all references to development stage.

	NOTE 9 – GOING CONCERN




	 



	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Currently, the Company has no operating history and has
	incurred an operating loss of $4,962, working capital deficit of $4,892 and as of February 29, 2016 the Company had an accumulated
	deficit of $4,962. These factor raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management
	believes that the Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company’s
	development efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for
	working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future. The conditions described above
	raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include
	any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
	that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND
	OFFICERS

	.


	 


	The Company's Articles
	of Incorporation provide that the Company shall indemnify any person who is or was a director to the maximum extent provided by
	statute. Pursuant to Wyoming Business Corporation Act (

	"WBCA"

	) Section 17-16-851, a corporation may indemnify
	a person made a party to a proceeding because he is or was a director against liability incurred in the proceeding if: (i) he conducted
	himself in good faith and reasonably believed that his conduct was in or at least not opposed to the corporation's best interests;
	and, (ii) in the case of a criminal proceeding, he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A corporation may
	not indemnify a director: (i) in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the director was adjudged
	liable to the corporation; or, (ii) in connection with any other


	proceeding charging
	improper personal benefit to him, whether or not involving action in his official capacity, in which he was adjudged liable on
	the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by him.


	 


	The Company's Articles
	of Incorporation provide that the Company shall indemnify any person who is or was an officer and not a director to the maximum
	extent provided by law, or to a greater extent if consistent with law and if provided by resolution of the Company's shareholders
	or directors, or in a contract. Pursuant to WBCA Section 17-16-856, a corporation may indemnify a current or former officer who
	is not a director to the extent, consistent with public policy, that may be provided by its articles of incorporation, bylaws,
	general or specific action of its board of directors or contract.

	UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	(a)(1) To file, during any period in which

	information in the registration statement;


	 


	(2) That, for the purpose of determining any
	liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
	relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial
	bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	(3) To remove from registration by means of
	a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	 


	(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability
	under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	 


	(i) 	If the registrant is subject to Rule
	430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration
	statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
	in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
	a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed
	incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to
	a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
	statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
	of first use.


	 


	(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability
	of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned
	registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement,
	regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such
	purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will
	be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:



	 


	 



	(i) 	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus
	of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii) 	Any free writing prospectus relating
	to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii) 	The portion of any other free writing
	prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided
	by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) 	Any other communication that is an
	offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 




	55




	 




	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to our directors, officer and controlling persons
	pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officer, or controlling
	persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officer, or controlling
	persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled
	by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




	 





	SIGNATURES



	 


	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
	Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto

	PROSPECTUS – SUBJECT TO COMPLETION
	DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2016



	 



	Red Fish Holdings, Inc.



	 



	Up to 1,000,000 Common Shares at $.20
	per Share



	 


	Red Fish Holdings, Inc. (“we”,
	“us”, or the “Company”) is offering for sale a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value
	$0.001 per share, at the price of $.20 per share.  There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering
	to close, and therefore we may receive no proceeds or very minimal proceeds from the offering.  The aggregate offering price
	of all securities sold under this prospectus may not exceed $200,000. The offering will commence on the effective date of this
	prospectus and will terminate on or before the six month period succeeding the effective date.


	We will sell the common shares ourselves
	and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no
	one has agreed to buy any of our common shares. The common shares will be sold by Mr. Thomas Mahoney, the Company’s Chief
	Executive Officer and Director. There is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of such
	common shares will go into escrow, trust or another similar arrangement. Because there is no minimum that must be raised from this
	offering, potential investors may be left holding shares in a company that has not received enough proceeds from the offering to
	cover offering expenses, pay for the expenses of being a reporting company, or begin operations. We will bear the all of the costs
	associated with this offering.


	This is our initial public offering.
	Our common stock is not listed for trading on any exchange or automated quotation system. We intend, upon the effectiveness of
	the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry
	Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application
	for quotation will be approved. Additionally, there can be no assurances that enough shares will be sold in this offering to create
	a market for our shares.


	 


	We were incorporated in the State of
	Wyoming on August 4, 2015. We are a developmental stage company, with limited operational history. Our business strategy is to
	acquire undervalued assets within the mobile application and mobile gaming industries as well as the small patented technologies
	industry and to develop and enhance their visibility through web-based and traditional marketing. Readers are encouraged to reference
	the section entitled “Business Operations” found on page ___ herein for additional information regarding our business.


	 


	Our auditors have indicated in their
	opinion on our financial statements as of and for the period from inception to October 31, 2015 that there exists substantial doubt
	as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, we are an early stage venture with limited operating history.

	As
	such, this offering is highly speculative and the common stock being offered for sale involves a high degree of risk and should
	be considered only be persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Readers are encouraged to reference the section
	entitled “Risk Factors” found on page ___ herein for additional information regarding the risks associated with our
	company and common stock



	 


	Please note that the Company is a “shell”
	company in accordance with Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, any securities sold in this offering
	can only be resold through registration under the Securities Act of 1933; Section 4(1), if available, for non-affiliates; or by
	meeting the following conditions of Rule 144(i): (a) the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased
	to be a shell company; (b) the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(D) of the
	Exchange Act of 1934; and the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed during
	the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form
	8-K reports; and at least one year has lapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission
	reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.

	A CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS



	This prospectus contains forward-looking
	statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
	by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”,
	“believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the
	negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements
	about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan,
	and the adequacy of our available cash resources.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
	statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Actual results
	may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements.  The economic environment within
	which we operate could materially affect our actual results.  Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking
	statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the volatility of real estate prices, the possibility that our marketing
	efforts will not be successful in identifying customers in need of our products and services, the Company’s need for and
	ability to obtain additional financing, and, other factors over which we have little or no control.


	 


	While these forward-looking statements,
	and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction
	of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions
	or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United
	States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.






	SUMMARY INFORMATION



	 


	As used in this prospectus, references
	to the “Company,” “we,” “our”, “us” or “Company Name” refer to Red
	Fish Holdings, Inc. unless the context otherwise indicated.


	 


	You should carefully read all information
	in the prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes, under the Financial Statements prior to making
	an investment decision.


	 






	The Company




	 





	Organization:




	We were incorporated under the laws
	of the State of Wyoming on August 4, 2015. Our principal office is located at 1360 Little Duck Cir. Gulf Breeze, FL 32563. Our
	telephone number is (858) 531-4361.


	 






	Capitalization:




	Our articles of incorporation provide
	for the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001. As of the date of this Prospectus there are 5,000,000
	shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Our articles of incorporation do not provide for the issuance of any preferred
	stock or other class of equity securities.


	 






	Management:




	Our Chief Executive Officer, Director
	and Secretary is Tom Mahoney. Tom Mahoney represents our lone employee. Mr. Mahoney is engaged in other business activities and
	thus expects to devote approximately 80 hours each month to the Company.


	 






	Controlling Shareholders:




	Our Chief Executive Officer, Director
	and Secretary, Tom Mahoney, is our lone shareholder having five million shares. Mr. Mahoney will continue to exercise significant
	control over the affairs of the Company following the offering.


	 











	6










	 






	 







	Shell Company Status:




	We are a 

	“shell company”

	 within
	the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we have nominal assets and nominal operations.  Accordingly,
	the securities sold in this offering can only be resold through registration under Section 5 the Securities Act of 1933, Section
	4(1), if available, for non-affiliates or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i).  A holder of our securities may not rely
	on the safe harbor from being deemed statutory underwriter under Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, as provided by Rule 144,
	to resell his or her securities. Only after we (i) are not a shell company, and (ii) have filed all reports and other materials
	required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter
	period that we may be required to file such reports and materials, other than Form 8-K reports); and have filed current 

	“Form
	10 information”

	 with the SEC reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of
	not less than 12 months, can our securities be resold pursuant to Rule 144.  

	“Form 10 information”

	 is,
	generally speaking, the same type of information as we are required to disclose in this prospectus, but without an offering of
	securities.  These circumstances regarding how Rule 144 applies to shell companies may hinder your resale of your shares of the
	Company.


	 






	Going Concern:




	Our independent auditor has expressed
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact that to date
	we have generated no revenues. Potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new venture,
	and the high rate of failure associated with this fact.


	 


	We have an accumulated deficit of ($4,658)
	and have not generated any revenues since inception. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future
	profitable operations from our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.






	 



	Our
	company and our officers, directors, any company promoter and their affiliates do not intend, once we are reporting, to use our
	company as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company.  We are not a blank check company, as such
	term is defined by Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as we have a specific business plan and we
	presently have no plans or intentions to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company, companies, entity or person

	 


	 






	Our Business




	 





	Plan of Operations:




	The Company plans to be primarily engaged
	in acquiring undervalued assets within the mobile application and mobile gaming industries as well as the small patented technologies
	industry and to develop and enhance their visibility through web-based and traditional marketing in an effort to generate revenue.


	 






	Historical Operations:




	Since inception, the Company has been
	negotiating acquisitions of mobile gaming applications. To date, the Company has added one (1) mobile gaming application, Dessert
	Crush Saga - on the iOS platform - to its portfolio. To date, the Company has generated an accumulated deficit of ($4,658) largely
	related to startup costs.


	 











	7










	 






	 







	Current Operations:




	The Company is currently working on developing its iOS mobile application and mobile gaming portfolio. This includes both evaluating opportunities for acquisitions as well as developing mobile applications “In house.”  The Company is seeking outside talent to further develop the flagship asset, a free-to-play mobile interactive match-three puzzle game called Dessert Crush Saga, with the focus on obtaining a sizeable user base and establishing user-based traction.

	Implications of being an Emerging
	Growth Company




	 


	We are an emerging growth company under
	the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:


	 






	1.


	The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of
	$200,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price
	Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;




	 






	2.


	The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the
	first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;




	 






	3.


	The date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $200,000,000
	in non-convertible debt; or




	 






	4.


	The date on which such issuer is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined
	in section 240.12b-2 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.




	 


	 


	As an emerging growth company we are exempt
	from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning
	the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess
	the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall,
	in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures
	for financial reporting.


	 


	As an emerging growth company we are also
	exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive
	compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.


	 


	We have elected to use the extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay
	the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until
	those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
	that comply with public company effective dates.

	RISK FACTORS



	In addition to other information provided
	in this prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any of
	our common stock.  All material risks are discussed in this section.


	 




	Risks Related to Our Company




	 




	Our having generated no revenues
	from operations makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates
	of our future performance.




	 


	As of October 31, 2015 we have generated
	no revenues and incurred a loss of ($4,658). As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results
	based upon our historical data.  Because of the related uncertainties, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and
	timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues and expenses.  If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable
	data, we may never become profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price. 


	 




	We may be unable to continue paying the costs of being
	a reporting public company.




	 



	The costs
	of being a public reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may be substantial and the Company




	may not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease
	being public in the future or require additional fundraising in order to remain in business. We estimate that in the future, costs
	for legal and accounting will be approximately $25,000 per year


	.



	 




	We are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes
	us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights.




	 


	We may offer to sell our common stock to investors
	pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state
	securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon
	our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may not seek any legal opinion
	to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we may elect to
	relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investor themselves.


	 


	If any such offering did not qualify for such
	exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible that if
	an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those states where
	the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification
	provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful in
	seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally,
	if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties
	imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies.


	 


	 




	Our auditor has indicated in its
	report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and
	if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.




	 


	Our auditor has indicated in its report
	that our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements
	do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate significant revenue
	or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.


	 







	11










	 








	Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws limit the
	liability of, and provide indemnification for, our officers and directors.




	 


	Our Certificate of Incorporation, generally
	limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the Company and its stockholders for breach of fiduciary
	duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve
	intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, provide indemnification for
	our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the Wyoming General Corporation Law against all expense, liability,
	and loss, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement reasonably
	incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, administrative
	or investigative (hereinafter a “Proceeding") to which the officer or director is made a party or is threatened to be
	made a party, or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of
	the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company whether the basis of the Proceeding is an alleged action in an
	official capacity as an officer or director, or in any other capacity while serving as an officer or director. Thus, the Company
	may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities
	incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the Company.  Such an indemnification payment might deplete the
	Company's assets. Stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of the Company
	should consult with independent legal counsel. It is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that exculpation from
	and indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
	is against public policy and therefore unenforceable.


	 




	We are dependent on the sale of
	our securities to fund our operations

	.



	 


	We are dependent on the sale of
	our securities to fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs.
	 Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of
	cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our equity
	or debt securities.


	 




	The Company may not be able to
	attain profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable.





	 



	The Company has limited capital resources.
	Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, the Company may experience
	liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing
	is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations.


	 




	Expenses required to operate as
	a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely
	affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.




	 


	Operating as a public company is more
	expensive than operating as a private company, including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting,
	investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned.  We may also be required to hire additional
	staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements.  We anticipate that the cost of SEC reporting will be approximately
	$25,000 annually.  Our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively
	affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.  If we fail to meet
	these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board, or,
	if we have secured a qualification, we may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the OTC Bulletin
	Board.  Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors
	will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly, annual reports and other required
	SEC reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming
	a non-reporting issuer.


	 




	Our lack of history makes evaluating our business difficult.




	 







	12










	 






	We have a limited operating history and we may not sustain
	profitability in the future.


	 


	To sustain profitability, we must:


	 







	-




	develop mobile applications for which there is significant consumer
	deamnd










	-




	compete with larger, more established competitors in the mobile appli










	-




	build, maintain, and enhance our portfolio of individual labels and
	overall brand recognition; and










	-




	adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments.





	 


	We may not be successful in accomplishing
	these objectives. Further, our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. Our prospects
	must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their
	early stages of development, particularly companies in highly competitive industries. The historical information in this report
	may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance.


	 



	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	Risks Related to Our Business



	 




	We operate in highly competitive
	and rapidly evolving technology markets, and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail
	to compete effectively in the future.




	 


	The mobile application market is highly
	competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based on brand name recognition, product quality, and purchasing convenience.
	Our business will likely face competition from other large corporations and regional investment groups. We have no direct competitors
	that compete within our business model, per se. However, we compete with many companies and investment groups that seek to purchase
	distressed and undervalued or underfunded mobile applications, software programs, and other small patentable technologies with
	the intention of maximizing its monetization potential. Moreover, the market for mobile games in particular is crowded with a large
	number of established and specialized companies.

	See

	Risks Related to Our Business - “The markets in which we operate
	are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.”


	 




	The business to consumer marketplace is highly competitive.
	If we cannot develop and promote confidence in 

	our Company

	 we may not be able to compete with our competitors,
	which would adversely affect our ability to general revenues.




	 


	We have many potential competitors in the business
	to consumer marketplace. In most instances, our competition is competent, experienced, and has greater financial, and marketing
	resources than we do at the present. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote
	greater resources to the development, promotion, and marketing of their services than are available to us. Our competitors may
	also offer a wider range of products and have greater brand recognition. They may have greater customer loyalty bases and these
	competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities. In addition, our competitors may be able to undertake
	more extensive promotional activities, and adopt more aggressive advertising campaigns than the Company.


	 


	 




	The markets
	in which we operate are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.

	 



	 


	Developing
	or enhancing development of, distributing, and selling mobile applications and mobile gaming applications is a highly competitive
	business marked by continuous introductions of new products as well as rapidly emerging platforms, technologies, and digital storefronts.  For
	players, we compete primarily on the basis of game







	13










	 






	quality,
	brand, and customer reviews.  We compete for promotional and storefront placements based on these factors, as well as
	our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, perception of sales potential, and relationships with
	licensors of brands, properties and other content.  For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and
	other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships
	with storefront owners. We also compete for experienced and talented employees and consultants.


	 


	We compete
	with a continually increasing number of public companies, including Activision, DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft,
	GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Nexon, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies,
	including Kabam, Machine Zone, Rovio, Storm 8/Team Lava, and Supercell.  In addition, we face competition from online
	game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets.  We could also face increased
	competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to
	us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook or Yahoo, choose to enter or
	expand into the game space or develop competing games.


	 


	In addition,
	given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry,
	we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and
	other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. The
	proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers
	and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.


	 


	Some of our competitors and our potential
	competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:


	 







	•




	significantly greater financial resources;










	•




	greater experience with the free-to-play games and more effective game
	monetization;










	•




	stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;










	•




	greater experience and effectiveness integrating community features
	into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users through social gamification;










	•




	the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader
	portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;










	•




	larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;










	•




	larger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console
	gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;










	•




	more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they
	can develop games without having to pay royalties;










	•




	lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;










	•




	greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and










	•




	broader global distribution and presence.





	 


	If we are unable to compete effectively
	or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we
	could lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.


	 




	Sales of and demand for our portfolio
	products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends.




	 


	Our success depends on our ability to
	anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into
	marketable product offerings. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge
	the market for our products, our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished
	goods inventory.


	 







	14










	 






	In response, we may be forced to increase
	our marketing promotions, provide mark-down allowances to our customers or liquidate excess merchandise, any of which could have
	a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. Our brand image may also suffer if customers believe that we are
	no longer able to offer innovative products, respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our products.


	 


	Since our free-to-play games can be
	downloaded and played for free, we have to succeed in generating a significant number of game installations and significant user-base
	growth.  However, we will rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenues derived from
	in-app purchases (as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers).  To significantly increase our revenues, we
	must increase the number of players who convert into a paying player by making in-app purchases, increase the amount that our paying
	players spend in our games and/or increase the length of time our players generally play our games.  We may encounter
	difficulties with game monetization (for example, developing a sufficient quantity and variety of virtual goods to enable a relatively
	large scale of in-app purchases by an individual user) if we cannot predict consumer preferences and trends.


	 




	We will
	likely derive the majority of our revenues from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if either of these storefronts
	were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.




	 



	The
	majority of our smartphone revenues will likely be derived from Apple’s iOS platform with the significant majority of such
	revenues derived from in-app purchases.  We will try to generate the balance of our iOS-related revenues from offers
	and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent, sales of premium games.  




	 




	We
	will need to maintain a good relationship with Apple and Google, which can lead to our applications being featured on their storefronts
	when they were commercially released.  If we do not receive prominent featuring, users may find it more difficult to
	discover our games and we may not generate revenues from them.  We may also be required to spend significantly more on
	marketing campaigns to increase visibility of our products and generate substantial revenues on these platforms.  In
	addition, currently neither Apple nor Google charges a publisher when it features one of their apps.  If either Apple
	or Google were to charge publishers to feature an app, it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably.  Accordingly,
	any change or deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock
	price to decline

	.  


	 


	We will likely
	rely on the continued functioning of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.  In the past these digital storefronts
	have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality.  


	If either of
	these events recurs on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenues from these
	storefronts, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.  In addition, if these storefront
	operators fail to provide high levels of service, our players’ ability to access our games may be interrupted or players
	may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand.


	 




	We may
	publish games developed by third parties, which may expose us to a number of potential operational and legal risks.



	 




	 




	Our
	Company may plan on entering into relationships with developers of games, primarily in Asian and Eastern European markets, where
	we will localize and globally publish those games.   We may be required to provide third party developers with upfront
	license fees or non-recoupable minimum guarantees in order to obtain the rights to publish their games, and we may incur significant
	costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched.  




	 




	The
	games may not be commercially successful if they do not appeal to a Western audience, if our limited experience in publishing other
	developers’ games leads to unexpected results or for any other reason, which would negatively impact our operating results.  
	In addition, if any of the games created by third party developers


	with which we work
	or acquire infringe intellectual property owned by others, or otherwise violate any third party’s rights or any applicable
	laws and regulations, such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy, we would be exposed to potential legal risks by
	publishing these games

	.

	The operators
	of digital storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of
	our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others’

	 contracts with
	them



	.




	 


	We will likely
	distribute our free-to-play games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, for which the distribution terms and conditions
	are often 

	“click through”

	agreements that we are not able to negotiate.  For example, we are
	subject to each of Apple’s and Google’s standard click-through terms and conditions for application developers, which
	govern the promotion, distribution and operation of apps, including games, on their storefronts.  Either Apple or Google
	can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions with no prior notice to us.  


	 


	In addition,
	the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator.  Further, these
	storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the
	developer violates its standard terms and conditions.  For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting
	certain types of virtual currency-incentivized advertising offers in games sold on the Apple App Store.


	 


	Most recently,
	Apple has implemented certain restrictions related to games that include guns, including changing its game rating methodology,
	which has resulted in games that include gun violence receiving a 17+ rating, and prohibiting certain depictions of guns in game
	icons and other storefront art; these restrictions, could potentially negatively impact the number of people playing popular 

	“shooter”

	 games
	and the revenues we could generate from such assets, if we chose to acquire one.  


	 


	In addition,
	during the second quarter of 2014, Apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incentivized video advertising in
	games sold on the Apple App Store.  These incentivized video advertisements have attempted to take into account several
	pitfalls of the older ad-revenue models in place for mobile applications, however, the Apple Store has prohibited the use of such
	strategies because of its “unfair” effect on chart rankings and thus deemed it a violation of their terms. If Apple
	or Google, or any other key storefront operator, determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms
	and conditions, by a new interpretation or otherwise or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront, it would materially
	harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline.


	 




	Apple’s
	requirement that beginning 

	February 1, 2015 all new applications, and beginning June
	1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with
	the iOS 8 software development kit, could harm our business. 





	If we acquire
	an asset that is incompatible with Apple’s requirement, we may have to expend more resources to update and port such an acquisition.
	In the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple informed developers that beginning

	on February 1, 2015 all
	new applications, and beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must
	include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 software development kit.    If we fail to implement 64-bit
	support for any of our existing games or assets or those that will undergo redevelopment that we intend to launch, it would negatively
	impact our revenues in 2016 and potentially beyond.  In addition, due to the expense involved in supporting 64-bit development,
	we may have difficulty in locating and acquiring compatible assets to add to our portfolio which will adversely affect revenues
	more quickly than they otherwise would have.  Furthermore, building our games to support 64-bit development will increase
	the file size of our games, which could reduce the number of downloads of these games, particularly if we are unable to keep the
	size of the games below 100 megabytes, which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier’s
	wireless network.



	 




	If we fail to successfully promote
	and maintain our brand, our business could be materially adversely affected



	.




	 



	We believe that broad brand recognition
	and a favorable consumer perception of our brand identity and website are essential to our future success. Accordingly, we intend
	to initiate a substantial advertising and marketing campaign to establish our brand.


	 


	If we fail to successfully promote and
	maintain our brand, incur significant expenses in promoting our brand and fail to generate a corresponding increase in revenue
	as a result of our branding efforts, or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand name, our business
	could be materially adversely affected. In addition, even if







	16










	 






	brand
	identity and Website recognition increases, the number of new customers or the number of sales or average dollars per sale may
	not increase, which could negatively affect our financial performance.


	 


	We must complete the development of
	our website and continually improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our products and services in order to maintain
	our consumer base. We may not succeed in developing features, functions, products or services that end-consumers find attractive.
	This could reduce the number potential buyers using our website and materially adversely affect our business.


	 




	Because we have a limited history
	of operations we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.




	 


	As a development stage company, we have
	less than one year of operational history in our industry. Accordingly, our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the
	establishment of a new business enterprise, including access to capital, successful implementation of our business plan, and no
	revenue from operations. We cannot assure you that our intended activities or plan of operation will be successful or result in
	revenue or profit to us and any failure to implement our business plan may have a material adverse effect on the business of the
	Company.


	 




	If we fail to effectively manage
	our growth, our business, brand and reputation, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.





	 



	We may experience a rapid growth in
	operations, which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. As we
	continue to grow, we must effectively identify, integrate, develop and motivate new employees, and maintain the beneficial aspects
	of our corporate culture. To attract top talent, we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages. The risks of
	over-hiring or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability.


	 


	Additionally, if we do not effectively
	manage our growth, the quality of our services portfolio offerings could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, brand
	and reputation, results of operations and financial condition. If operational, technology and infrastructure improvements are not
	implemented successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures
	to address these issues. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management
	controls and our reporting systems and procedures.


	 


	This will require that we refine our
	information technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure
	that our employees effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers. These system enhancements and improvements
	will require significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources.
	If we fail to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and
	comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional
	expenses.



	 





	We depend heavily on key personnel,
	and turnover of key senior management could harm our business.




	 



	Our
	future business and results of operations depend, in significant part, upon the continued contributions of our Chief Executive
	Officer. If we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain
	skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete
	our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees
	in managing the product acquisition, marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover
	in the future

	.


	 




	Our management has not had experience
	in managing the day to day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may incur additional expenses associated with the
	management of our company.




	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Mahoney,
	is responsible for the operations and reporting of our company. The requirements of operating as a small public company are new
	to our management. This may require us to obtain







	17










	 






	outside
	assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also
	be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements. We anticipate that the costs associated
	with SEC requirements associated with going and staying public are estimated to be approximately $25,000 in connection with this
	registration statement and thereafter $25,000 annually. If we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future, our failure
	to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely
	affect our potential results of operations, cash flow and financial condition after we commence operations.


	 




	Our future results and reputation
	may be affected by litigation or other liability claims.




	 


	We have not procured a general liability
	insurance policy for our business. To the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by general liability,
	we would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or
	judgment against us. Adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our business or our securities.


	 




	If the
	use of smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase, our
	business could be adversely affected.




	 


	While the number
	of people using mobile Internet-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past
	few years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging, and it may not grow as we anticipate.  Our
	future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games.  The proliferation
	of mobile devices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile Internet-enabled
	devices as a platform for games.  In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our
	games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation
	platforms. 


	 




	Our business is subject to
	increasing governmental regulation. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.




	 


	We are subject
	to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business.  Not only are these laws constantly
	evolving, which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually
	being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.  In the United States, for
	example, numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of games.  Legislation
	has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors.  If
	such legislation is adopted, it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting
	the size of the potential market for our games.  


	 


	We may also
	be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations,
	which could be costly or delay the release of our games.  In particular, free-to-play games have been subject to such
	legislation and public policy concerns already. For example, the United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading issued new principles
	in January 2014 relating to in-app purchases in free-to-play games that are directed towards children 16 and under, which principles
	became effective in April 2014.  In response to a request made by the European Commission, Google has announced that
	it will no longer label free-to-play games as free in European Union countries.  Similarly, in the fourth quarter of
	2014, Apple changed its label for free-to-download applications from 

	“FREE”

	 to 

	“GET”

	 in
	the Apple App Store.  


	 


	The Federal
	Trade Commission has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to
	games that are marketed primarily to minors; the Federal Trade Commission recently reached settlement agreements with Apple and
	Google on this subject.  If the Federal Trade Commission issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app
	purchases, it would significantly impact our business strategy.  


	 


	Furthermore,
	the growth and development of free-to-play gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection
	laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of this
	industry will increase and that we will be required to devote resources to addressing such regulation.  For example,
	existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and







	18










	 






	banking
	institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods.  If that were to occur we may be required to seek
	licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital
	and other requirements which could significantly increase our operating costs.  


	 


	Finally, because
	our services may be available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with
	their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.



	 





	We may be subject to regulatory
	inquiries, claims, suits prosecutions which may impact our profitability.




	 


	Any failure or perceived failure by
	us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, in general, may subject us to regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions.
	We can give no assurance that we will prevail in such regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions on commercially reasonable
	terms or at all. Responding to, defending and/or settling regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions may be time-consuming
	and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business. A negative outcome in any of these
	proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services, potential liabilities or additional costs that
	could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.


	 




	We are subject to complex federal,
	state, local and other laws and regulations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
	of operations.




	 


	Our business is subject to various,
	and sometimes complex, laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations,
	we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities.
	We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations.


	 


	In addition, our costs of compliance
	may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to
	our operations. These costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
	Moreover, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 




	Any change to government regulation/administrative
	practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.




	 


	The laws, regulations, policies or current
	administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction,
	may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business.
	The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest
	groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate
	and/or our profitably.


	 




	We do not yet have substantial
	assets or revenues and are largely dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business. If we do not the sell
	shares in this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to complete our business or abandon them.





	 



	We have limited capital resources. To
	date, the Company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated sufficient cash from operations to be profitable.
	Unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, we may experience liquidity
	and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force us to cease operations if additional financing is not available.
	No known alternative sources of funds are available to the Company in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this offering.
	However, the Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for the
	next twelve months.

	If our estimates related to expenditures
	and cash flow from operations are erroneous, or we are unable to sell additional equity securities, our business could fall short
	of expectations and you may lose your entire investment.




	 


	Our financial success is dependent in
	part upon the accuracy of our management's estimates of expenditures and cash flow from operations. If such estimates are erroneous
	or inaccurate, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could, in a worst-case scenario, result in the failure
	of our business and you losing your entire investment.


	 




	Our business may be harmed by future intellectual property
	right claims or disputes.




	 


	We may receive in the future, communications
	alleging that certain items listed or sold through our company or within one of our applications or a digital storefront infringe
	third-party copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights. These and future claims could result
	in increased costs of doing business through legal expenses, adverse judgment or settlement or require us to change our business
	practices in expensive ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that require us to change our business
	practices or otherwise increase our costs.


	 




	The laws
	and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving, and our actual or perceived failure to comply
	with these laws and regulations could harm our business.




	 


	We are subject
	to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users,
	which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  The U.S. government,
	including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation
	over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices.   Various government
	and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices.   


	 


	If we do not
	follow existing laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators, with respect to privacy-related
	matters, or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices, even if unfounded, it could damage our reputation and
	operating results.


	 


	All of potential
	games or software programs we choose to acquire will likely be subject to our privacy policy and a terms of service.  If
	we fail to comply with a posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy-related laws and regulations, including with respect
	to the information we collect from users of our games, it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or
	others, which could harm our business.  In addition, interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming
	industry is often unclear.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country
	to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying
	with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Further,
	if we fail to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data, it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services
	and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.


	 


	In the area
	of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security
	breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption
	of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  Costs to comply
	with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation.  Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply
	with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.  


	 


	Security measures
	that we put in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees, customers and partners could be breached
	due to cyber-attacks initiated by third party hackers, employee error or malfeasance, or otherwise.  Because the techniques
	used to obtain unauthorized access, to disable or degrade service or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized
	until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  Any
	breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in
	significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data, which
	could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.







	20










	 






	 




	We may be liable if third parties misappropriate our
	customers' personal information.




	 


	If third parties are able to penetrate
	our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers' personal information or credit card information, or if we give
	third parties improper access to our customers' personal information or credit card information, we could be subject to liability.
	This liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud
	claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes.


	 


	These claims could result in litigation.
	Liability for misappropriation of this information could adversely affect our business. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission
	and state agencies have been investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal information. We could incur
	additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate
	our privacy practices.


	We rely on encryption and authentication
	technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential
	information such as customer credit card numbers. We cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries
	in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we
	use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could harm our reputation, business,
	prospects, financial condition and results of operations. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate
	proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources
	to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. We cannot assure you that our security
	measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not harm our business, prospects,
	financial condition and results of operations.



	 





	If we
	fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for porting games to a broad array of mobile devices, particularly those running
	the Android operating system, our revenues and financial results could suffer. 




	 


	We will derive
	the majority of our revenues from the sale of virtual goods within our games for smartphones and tablets that run Apple’s
	iOS or Google’s Android operating system.  Unlike the Apple ecosystem in which Apple controls both the device (iPhone,
	iPod Touch and iPad) and the storefront (Apple’s App Store), the Android ecosystem is highly fragmented since a large number
	of OEMs manufacture and sell Android-based devices that run a variety of versions of the Android operating system, and there are
	many Android-based storefronts in addition to the Google Play Store.  For us to sell our games to the widest possible
	audience of Android users, we must comport our games to a significant portion of the more than 1,000 Android-based devices that
	are commercially available, many of which have different technical requirements.  Since the number of Android-based smartphones
	and tablets shipped worldwide is growing significantly, it is important that we maintain and enhance our porting capabilities,
	which could require us to invest considerable resources in this area.  These additional costs could harm our business,
	operating results and financial condition.  In addition, we must continue to increase the efficiency of our porting processes
	or it may take us longer to port games to an equivalent number of devices, which would negatively impact our margins.  If
	we fail to maintain or enhance our porting capabilities, our revenues and financial results could suffer.



	 





	We depend upon third-party servicers
	to deliver our products to our customers on a timely and consistent basis.





	 




	We
	will rely upon multiple third parties for the development and enhancement of our portfolio of products. A deterioration in our
	relationship with any one of these third parties could decrease our ability to track shipments, cause shipment delays, and increase
	our shipping costs and the number of damaged products.


	Because we
	may not have a written long-term agreement with any of these third parties, we cannot be sure that these relationships will continue
	on terms favorable to us, if at all. If our relationships with these third parties are terminated or impaired or if these third
	parties are unable to deliver products for us, whether through labor shortage, slow down or stoppage, deteriorating financial or
	business condition or for any other reason, we would be required to use alternative servicers. We may be unable to engage alternative
	carriers on a timely basis or upon terms favorable to us. Changing servicers would likely have a negative effect on our business,
	operating results and financial condition.



	 







	21










	 








	Real or perceived errors, failures
	or bugs in our software could impact our reputation, and as a result, adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.




	Because the
	technology that we acquire or develop for our mobile applications is complex, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur, especially
	when new versions or updates of our applications are released. Any errors, failures or bugs that impact the usability of our applications
	may cause customer dissatisfaction. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs, including installation errors or policies established
	by our customers, could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance, and loss of competitive position.
	Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions,
	delays or cessation of sales, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating
	results and growth prospects.


	 



	 





	Risks Related to Our Common Stock




	 




	Due to the lack of a current public market for our
	stock, investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase




	 


	Prior to this Offering, no public trading
	market existed for the Company’s securities. There can be no assurance that a public trading market for the Company’s
	common stock will develop or that a public trading market, if develop, will be sustained. The common stock sold pursuant to this
	prospectus will be freely tradable, however will not be eligible for quotation on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. We intend,
	upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, to engage a market maker to apply for
	quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.


	 


	There can be no assurance that a market
	maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC
	Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. Thus, it is
	anticipated that there will be little or no market for the Shares until the Company is eligible to have its common stock quoted
	on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board and as a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder.
	Because there is none and may be no public market for the Company’s stock, the Company may not be able to secure future equity
	financing which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.


	 


	Furthermore, when and if the Company’s
	common stock is eligible for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, there can also be no assurance as to the depth or
	liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares.


	 


	As a result, investors could find it
	more difficult to trade, or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of, the stock as compared to securities that are
	traded on the NASDAQ trading market or on an exchange. Moreover, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any Shares purchased
	hereunder.


	 




	Investors may have difficulty
	in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state Blue Sky laws.




	 


	Our common stock is currently not quoted
	on any market. No market may ever develop for our common stock, or if developed, may not be sustained in the future.


	 


	The holders of our shares of common
	stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there
	may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful
	in having the Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities
	to be a limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication
	which permits a "manual exemption." This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state
	without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized
	by the state.


	 







	22










	 






	However, it is not enough for the security
	to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's
	balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent
	fiscal year of operations.  We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information.  Furthermore,
	the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers
	selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service,
	Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals.


	 


	A smaller number of states declare that
	they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any
	provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana,
	South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.


	Accordingly, our shares should be considered
	totally illiquid, which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares.



	 





	We will be subject to penny stock
	regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.




	 


	The SEC has adopted regulations which
	generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share
	or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions.  We anticipate that our common stock
	will become a “penny stock”, and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock
	Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other
	than established customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination
	for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule
	may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities
	in the secondary market.


	 


	For any transaction involving a penny
	stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared
	by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the
	broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required
	to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in
	penny stock.


	 


	We do not anticipate that our common
	stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock
	Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person
	from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.


	 




	Sales of our common stock under
	Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock.




	 



	There
	are zero (0) shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates and 5,000,000 shares held by affiliates that Rule 144 of the Securities
	Act of 1933 defines as restricted securities.


	1,000,000 newly issued shares may be registered
	in this offering, however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144.  In
	general, persons holding restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months,
	may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and must resell the shares
	in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price.  The availability for sale of substantial amounts of common
	stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities.



	 




	Because we do not have an audit
	or compensation committee, shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors, none of which are independent, to perform
	these functions.




	 


	We do not have an audit or compensation
	committee comprised of independent directors.  Indeed, we do not have any audit or compensation committee.  These
	functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole.  No members of the board of directors are independent directors.  Thus,
	there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning
	management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.

	Our Chief Executive Officer and
	Director owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders
	to effect certain corporate actions


	.


	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer and Director,
	Tom Mahoney, owns all of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, currently, and after the offering, he will possess a significant
	influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions.
	Their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation,
	takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer.


	 




	There may not be funds available
	for net income because our Chief Executive Officer and Director maintains significant control and can determine his own salary
	and perquisites.




	 


	Our CEO Tom Mahoney, owns all of our
	outstanding voting securities. As a result, there may not be funds available for net income because he maintains significant control
	and can determine his own salary and perquisites.


	 




	We may, in the future, issue additional
	shares of common stock, which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.




	 


	Our Articles of Incorporation authorize
	the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock.  As of the date of this prospectus the Company had 5,000,000
	shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 95,000,000 shares of common stock. The future
	issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders.
	We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions
	or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse
	effect on any trading market for our common stock.


	 




	We are subject to compliance with securities law, which
	exposes us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights.




	 


	We may offer to sell our common stock
	to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those
	of various state securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions
	depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may not seek any
	legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we
	may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investor themselves.


	 


	If any such offering did not qualify
	for such exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible
	that if an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those
	states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or
	qualification provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were
	successful in seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations.
	Additionally, if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines
	and penalties imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies.


	 




	Anti-takeover effects of certain
	provisions of Wyoming state law hinder a potential takeover of the Company.




	 



	Though
	not now, we may be or in the future we may become subject to Wyoming’s control share law. A corporation is subject to Wyoming’s
	control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Wyoming,
	and it does business in Wyoming or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling
	interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the
	acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i)
	one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability
	to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.


	The
	effect of the control share law is that the acquiring








	24










	 






	person, and those
	acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders
	of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights
	will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares
	of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares
	acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its
	shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed
	by the control share law. If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares
	with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor
	of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder’s shares.


	 



	Wyoming’s
	control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation.


	In
	addition to the control share law, Wyoming has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between
	Wyoming corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first
	becomes an “interested stockholder,” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in
	advance. For purposes of Wyoming law, an “interested stockholder” is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly
	or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate
	or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
	of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business
	combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use
	the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of
	the corporation and its other stockholders.


	The effect of Wyoming’s
	business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the Company from doing so if it cannot
	obtain the approval of our board of directors.



	 




	There is no current established
	trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop, purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling
	their shares.




	 


	There is currently no established public
	trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained.  While
	we intend to seek a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, there can be no assurance that any such trading market will develop, and
	purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so. No market makers have committed
	to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so.


	 




	Because we do not have an escrow account
	or trust account for our investor's subscriptions, if we file for bankruptcy protection or are forced into bankruptcy protection,
	investors will lose their entire investment.




	 


	Invested funds for this offering will not be
	placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy
	is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy
	laws. As such, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for the sourcing
	and sale of promotional products. 


	 


	.




	The offering price
	of $0.10 per share is arbitrary.





	The
	Offering price of $0.10 per share has been arbitrarily determined by our management and does not bear any relationship to the assets,
	net worth or projected earnings of the Company or any other generally accepted criteria of


	value.
	Given this it is possible that investors may suffer dilution in the value of shares purchased herein.





	We have no firm commitments
	to purchase any shares.





	We
	have no firm commitment for the purchase of any shares. Therefore there is no assurance that a trading market will develop or be
	sustained. The Company has not engaged a placement agent or broker for the sale of the shares. The Company may be unable to identify
	investors to purchase the shares


	.








	25










	 








	Because we are a “shell company” the holders of
	our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on Rule 144 and we cannot file registration statements
	under Section 5 of the Securities Act using a Form S-8, until we cease being a “shell company”




	 


	We are a 

	“shell
	company”

	 as that term is defined by the applicable federal securities laws.  Specifically, because of the nature
	and amount of our assets and our very limited operations, pursuant to applicable federal rules, we are considered a 

	“shell
	company”

	.  Applicable provisions of Rule 144 specify that during that time that we are a 

	“shell company”

	 and
	for a period of one year thereafter, holders of our restricted securities can not sell those securities in reliance on Rule 144.
	This restriction may have potential adverse effects on future efforts to form additional capital through unregistered offerings.
	Another implication of us being a shell company is that we cannot file registration statements under Section 5 of the Securities
	Act using a Form S-8, a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee
	benefit plan. As result, one year after we cease being a shell company, assuming we are current in our reporting requirements with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission and have filed current

	“Form 10 information”

	 with the SEC reflecting
	our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than 12 months, holders of our restricted securities
	may then sell those securities in reliance on Rule 144 (provided, however, those holders satisfy all of the applicable requirements
	of that rule). For us to cease being a 

	“shell company”

	 we must have more than nominal operations and
	more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents. 

	Shares
	purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares if and when applicable restrictions
	against resale expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. 


	 





	A low market price
	would severely limit the potential market for our common stock.





	Our
	common stock is expected to trade at a price substantially below $5.00 per share, subjecting trading in the stock to certain SEC
	rules requiring additional disclosures by broker-dealers. These rules generally apply to any non-NASDAQ equity security that has
	a market price share of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions (a “penny stock”). Such rules require
	the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated
	therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established
	customers and institutional or wealthy investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability
	determination


	for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent
	to the transaction prior to the sale. The broker –


	dealer also must disclose
	the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is
	the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market.
	Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to
	the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information
	on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements could discourage
	broker-


	dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock.




	 



	 


	 




	Because we do not intend to pay
	any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell
	them.




	 


	We intend to retain any future earnings
	to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in
	the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they
	sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired.


	 




	Opt-in right for emerging growth
	company




	 


	We have elected to use the extended
	transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under







	26










	 






	Section
	102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
	dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial
	statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.



	 





	Implications of Being an Emerging
	Growth Company.




	As a company with less than $1.0 billion
	in revenue during its last fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as
	long as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory
	requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies.  These provisions include:


	 







	-




	A requirement to have only two years of
	audited financial statements and only two years of related Management's Discussion and Analysis included in an initial public offering
	registration statement;










	-




	an exemption to provide less than five years
	of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement;










	-




	an exemption from the auditor attestation
	requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal controls over financial reporting;










	-




	an exemption from the adoption of new or
	revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;










	-




	an exemption from compliance with any new
	requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to
	the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial
	statements of the issuer; an










	-




	reduced disclosure about the emerging growth
	company's executive compensation arrangements





	 


	An emerging growth company is also exempt
	from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and
	report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Similarly,
	as a Smaller Reporting Company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and our independent registered public
	accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until
	such time as we cease being a Smaller Reporting Company.


	 


	As an emerging growth company, we are
	exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive
	compensation and golden parachutes.


	 


	Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides
	that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
	Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
	of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.  We have elected to take
	advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.  Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to
	those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.


	 


	We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the
	earliest of:


	 







	-




	the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering,










	-




	the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1 billion
	or more,










	-




	the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued
	more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or










	-




	as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common
	stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.





	 




	You may have limited access to
	information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the SEC could be automatically suspended
	under certain circumstances.  




	 







	27










	 






	As of effectiveness of our registration
	statement of which this prospectus is a part, we will be required to file periodic reports with the SEC which will be immediately
	available to the public for inspection and copying (see “Where You Can Find More Information” elsewhere in this prospectus).
	 


	 


	Except during the year that our registration
	statement becomes effective, these reporting obligations may (in our discretion) be automatically suspended under Section 15(d)
	of the Exchange Act if we have less than 300 shareholders and do not file a registration statement on Form 8A (which we have no
	current plans to file).  If this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective, we will no longer
	be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted.
	 After this registration statement on Form S-1 becomes effective, we will be required to deliver periodic reports to security
	holders.


	 


	However, we will not be required to
	furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to
	report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Previously, a company
	with more than 500 shareholders of record and $10 million in assets had to register under the Exchange Act.  However, the
	JOBS Act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from 500 to either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not "accredited
	investors" (or 2,000 persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies).  The JOBS Act excludes securities received
	by employees pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold.  This means
	that access to information regarding our business and operations will be limited.


	 




	Upon effectiveness of this registration
	statement, we will be subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which does not require
	a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting companies.




	 


	Upon effectiveness of this registration
	statement, we will be subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a Section
	15(d) filer, we will be required to file quarterly and annual reports during the fiscal year in which our registration statement
	is declared effective; however, such duty to file reports shall be suspended as to any fiscal year, other than the fiscal year
	within which such registration statement became effective, if, at the beginning of such fiscal year the securities of each class
	are held of record by less than 300 persons.  In addition, as a filer subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we are
	not required to prepare proxy or information statements; our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private
	regulations; we will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules; our officers, directors, and more than ten
	(10%) percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company; that these
	persons will not be subject to the short-swing profit recovery provisions of the Exchange Act; and that more than five
	percent (5%) holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions
	in the securities. As such, shareholders will not have access to certain material information which would otherwise be required
	if it was a fully reporting company pursuant to an Exchange Act registration


	 




	If we are not required to continue
	filing reports under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the future, for example because we have less than
	three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective,
	and we do not file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A, our common shares (if listed or quoted) would no longer be eligible for
	quotation, which could reduce the value of your investment.




	 



	As a result
	of this offering as required under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission as required under Section 15(d). However, if in the future we are not required to continue filing
	reports under Section 15(d), for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first
	fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective, and we do not file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A
	upon the occurrence of such an event, our common stock can no longer be quoted on the OTC Markets OTC Link, which could reduce
	the value of your investment.  Of course, there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the requirements to be able to
	cease filing reports under Section 15(d), in which case we will continue filing those reports in the years after the fiscal year
	in which this registration statement is declared effective.  Filing a registration statement on Form 8-A will require us to
	continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC.  In addition,
	our officers, directors and 10% stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading
	activity.

	The above figures represent only estimated
	costs. This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business
	conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
	status of and results from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
	proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes,
	and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will
	need to secure additional funding for the fully implement our business plan.


	 


	In the event we are not successful
	in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:







	-




	for general administrative expenses, including
	legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the SEC;










	29










	 











	-




	for office lease expenses and office equipment;










	-




	for sales and marketing;










	-




	for salaries for our Chief Executive Officer
	and the hiring of additional full-time employees; and










	-




	for consultants and developers’ salaries
	and wages.





	Our current corporate offices are located
	at 1360 Little Duck Circle, Gulf Breeze, FL 32563. If we are able to raise sufficient capital through this offering, we will seek
	to lease a larger, dedicated space at no more than $2,500 per month.



	 




	DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING
	PRICE



	Our management has determined
	the offering price for the common shares being sold in this offering. The price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined.
	The offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. The factors
	considered were:







	-




	Our status as a developmental stage, “startup”
	company;










	-




	Prevailing market conditions, including
	the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;










	-




	Our forecasted future prospects; and










	-




	Our current capital structure.





	Therefore, the public offering price
	of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices
	that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock. You cannot be sure that a public market
	for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering
	price in this offering. Such offering price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value, such as book value
	or earnings per share. Because we have no significant operating history, the price of our common stock is not based on past earnings,
	nor is the price of our common stock indicative of the current market value of the assets owned by us. No valuation or appraisal
	has been prepared for our business and potential business expansion. Our common stock is presently not traded on any market or
	securities exchange and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market. You cannot be sure that a public market
	for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering
	price in this offering.



	 


	 


	 





	DILUTION



	If you purchase any of the shares offered by
	this prospectus, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price
	per share and the post-offering net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution
	results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable
	to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock. As of October 31, 2015, our net tangible book value was $(4,158)
	or $(0.000832) per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets
	(excluding deferred offering costs) less total liabilities, divided by 5,000,000, the number of shares of common stock outstanding
	at October 31, 2015.


	 


	The following table sets forth as of October
	31, 2015, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholder and
	by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering
	expenses, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $.20 per share of common stock.

	Assuming the Issuer sells the entire offering
	of 1,000,000 shares, after giving effect to the sale of common shares in this offering, and after deducting underwriting discounts
	and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our post-offering net tangible book value as of October 31, 2015
	would be $170,842, or $0.28 per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in the post-offering net tangible book value
	of $.029 per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the post-offering net tangible book value of approximately
	$.17 per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this offering. We determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted
	net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock.



	 





	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	This Prospectus relates to the sale of
	1,000,000 common shares.


	 


	We will sell the common shares ourselves
	and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no
	one has agreed to buy any of our common shares. This prospectus permits our officers and directors to sell the common shares directly
	to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any common shares they may sell. There is no plan or
	arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the common shares with a broker or dealer. Our officers and directors
	will sell the common shares and intend to offer them to friends, family members and business acquaintances. There is no minimum
	amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common shares will go into escrow, trust or another
	similar arrangement.


	 


	The common shares are being offered
	by Tom Mahoney, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director. Mr. Tom Mahoney will be relying on the safe harbor in
	Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell the common shares. No sales commission will be paid for common shares
	sold by Tom Mahoney. Mr. Mahoney is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer.


	 


	Additionally, Mr. Mahoney primarily
	performs substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Mr. Mahoney
	has not been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding 12 months and they have not
	participated in selling an offering of securities for







	31










	 






	any
	issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on paragraph (a)4(i) or (a)4(iii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	The offering will terminate upon the
	earlier to occur of: (i) the sale of all 1,000,000 shares being offered, or (ii) 180 days after this registration statement is
	declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	There are no finders in this offering.


	 


	Under the rules of the Securities and
	Exchange Commission, our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common
	stock is below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock will be subject to the "penny stock" rules and regulations.
	Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the Commission’s regulations
	concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to:


	 


	- Make a suitability
	determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser;


	- Receive the purchaser’s
	written consent to the transaction; and


	- Provide certain
	written disclosures to the purchaser.


	 


	These requirements may restrict the
	ability of broker/dealers to sell our common stock, and may affect the ability to resell our common stock.



	 






	Market Information




	 


	There is no established public trading
	market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may not be sustained. A shareholder in
	all likelihood, therefore, will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for
	public resales. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans
	unless a regular trading market develops.


	 




	OTC Electronic Bulletin Board
	Considerations




	 


	To be quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
	Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. We anticipate that
	after this registration statement is declared effective, market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities
	will thereafter trade on the OTC Bulletin Board.


	 


	The OTC Electronic Bulletin Board is
	separate and distinct from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the
	OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. The SEC’s order handling rules, which apply to NASDAQ-listed securities, do not apply to securities
	quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.


	 


	Although the NASDAQ stock market has
	rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers, and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards, the
	OTC Electronic Bulletin Board has no listing standards. Rather, it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system,
	files the application, and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files. FINRA cannot deny an
	application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company. The only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that
	the issuer be current in its reporting requirements with the SEC.


	 


	Although we anticipate listing on the
	OTC Electronic Bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock, investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled
	because it is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market, it initially will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board rather
	than on NASDAQ. Investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed. Trading
	activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with NASDAQ-listed securities.


	 


	Investors must contact a broker-dealer
	to trade OTC Electronic Bulletin Board securities. Investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service. For bulletin
	board securities, there only has to be one market maker.







	32










	 






	 


	Bulletin board transactions are conducted
	almost entirely manually. Because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board, they are conducted
	via telephone. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time
	it takes to execute investor orders. Therefore, when investors place market orders - an order to buy or sell a specific number
	of shares at the current market price - it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse
	of time between placing a market order and getting execution.


	 



	Because
	bulletin board stocks are usually not followed by analysts, there may be lower trading volume than for NASDAQ-listed securities.


	There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin Board.




	 





	Blue Sky Law Considerations




	 


	The holders of our shares of common
	stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there
	may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful
	in having the Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities
	to be a limited one. There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. We intend to
	seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a "manual exemption”.
	This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing
	the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the
	security to be listed in a recognized manual.


	 



	The
	listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and
	loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. We may
	not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption
	restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted
	manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance
	Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities
	manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not
	expressly recognize the manual exemption: AL, CA, IL, KY, LA, MT, NH, NY, PA, TN and VA

	.

	We
	currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified
	before they can be resold by our shareholders

	.





	 





	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	 


	The following description as a summary
	of the material terms of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws have
	been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.


	 




	Common Stock




	 


	We are authorized to issue 100,000,000
	shares of common stock with $0.001 par value per share. As of the date of this registration statement, there were 5,000,000 shares
	of common stock issued and outstanding held by one (1) shareholder, our Chief Executive Officer and Director.


	 


	Each share of common stock entitles
	the holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of shareholders. The holders are not permitted to vote their
	shares cumulatively. Accordingly, the shareholders of our common stock who hold, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the
	total voting rights can elect all of our directors and, in such event, the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be
	able to elect any of such directors.


	 







	33










	 






	The vote of the holders of a majority
	of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize, affirm, ratify or consent
	to such act or action, except as otherwise provided by law.


	 


	Holders of common stock are entitled
	to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We have
	not paid any dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development
	of our business. Any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon,
	among other things, our future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.


	 


	Holders of our common stock have no
	preemptive rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. Upon our liquidation,
	dissolution or windup, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for
	distribution to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities. There are not any provisions in our Articles
	of Incorporation or our Bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control.


	 


	Upon completion of the offering, Cathedral
	Stock Transfer will act as the registrant's transfer agent.


	 




	Preferred Stock




	 


	By resolution of our
	majority shareholder, we may, without any further vote or action by our shareholders, amend our articles of incorporation to authorize
	and issue, subject to limitations prescribed by law, shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more
	classes or class. With respect to any classes or class, the Board may determine the designation and the number of shares, preferences,
	limitations and special rights, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and liquidation
	preferences. Because of the rights that may be granted, the issuance of preferred stock may delay, defer or prevent a change of
	control. Prior to this offering, we had no shares of preferred issued and outstanding.



	 






	Dividend Policy




	 


	We have never paid or declared any cash
	dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
	We intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business. Any future
	determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including
	our results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable
	law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.




	 







	Share Eligible for Future Sale




	 


	Prior to this offering, there was no
	public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the
	availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts
	of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future
	ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.


	 


	We have authorized an aggregate of 100,000,000
	shares of our common stock. Of these shares, only the 1,000,000 to be registered in this offering will be freely tradeable without
	restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless those shares are purchased by our affiliates, as that term
	is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.


	 


	The remaining 5,000,000 shares of common
	stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws. Restricted securities may be sold in the
	public market only if they have been registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the
	Securities Act.



	 





	Implication of the Applicability
	of Rule 144




	 







	34










	 






	Sales under the Rule 144 by our affiliates
	or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements
	and to the availability of current public information about us.


	 


	There are zero (0) shares of our common stock
	held by non-affiliates and five million (5,000,000) shares held by affiliates that Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 defines
	as restricted securities. Pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Rule 144”), a “shell
	company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely
	of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.


	 


	As such, because we have nominal assets and
	minimal operations, we are still considered a “shell company” pursuant to Rule 144 and as such, sales of our securities
	pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until we have ceased to be a “shell company” and we are subject to Section
	13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least
	the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to Rule 144; and a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the
	date “Form 10 information” (i.e., information similar to that which would be found in a Form 10 Registration Statement
	filing with the SEC

	 

	has been filed with the Commission reflecting the Company’s status as a non-“shell
	company.”


	 




	Penny Stock Considerations




	 


	Our shares will be "penny stocks",
	as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00.
	Thus, our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in
	certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone
	other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's
	written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt.


	 


	In addition, under the penny stock regulations,
	the broker-dealer is required to:


	 







	-




	Deliver, prior to any transaction involving
	a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless
	the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;










	-




	Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer
	and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;










	-




	Send monthly statements disclosing recent
	price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer's account, the account's value, and information regarding the
	limited market in penny stocks; and










	-




	Make a special written determination that
	the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction, prior
	to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account.





	 


	Because of these regulations, broker-dealers
	may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our Common Stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders
	or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market, and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in
	the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if our
	securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease
	in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will,
	in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.




	 




	 







	INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS




	 


	The financial statements for the period
	from inception to October 31, 2015 included in this prospectus have been audited by K. Brice Toussaint, CPA who is a certified
	public accounting firm, to the extent and for the periods set forth in our report and are incorporated herein in reliance upon
	such report given upon the authority of said firm as

	experts
	in auditing and accounting. There have not been any changes in or disagreements with this firm on accounting and financial disclosure
	or any other matter.


	 


	The legality of the shares offered under
	this registration statement is being passed upon by Adam S. Tracy, Esq., Securities Compliance Group, Ltd., 2100 Manchester Road,
	Suite 615, Wheaton, IL 60187 (888) 978-9901. Mr. Tracy does not own any shares of the company.




	 




	 







	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS




	 


	The Company was incorporated under the
	laws of the State of Wyoming on August 4, 2015. We are a developmental stage company principally involved in the business of locating,
	acquiring, and turning around undervalued assets within the mobile gaming and patented small technologies sector. Since inception,
	we have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount $4,658.


	 




	Industry Overview




	 


	The growth of the mobile entertainment
	market is being shaped by an intersection of trends in the wireless communications and entertainment industries since wireless
	carriers provide the primary marketing and distribution channel for mobile games and branded content owners provide the licensing
	relationships that facilitate creating a large and diverse portfolio of recognizable games


	 


	The mobile game market differs substantially
	from the traditional console game market. Mobile games typically have significantly lower development and distribution costs and
	longer life cycles than console games. Console game sales depend upon the product cycles of the consoles themselves, with large
	generational shifts between versions of each of the major console platforms every few years. In contrast, the mobile platform is
	characterized by a gradual evolution of features and capabilities in the many new handsets introduced each year by a large number
	of manufacturers and carriers. Consumers typically use their console games within the confines of their homes, while mobile games
	are available in all the settings where consumers take their mobile handsets. Furthermore, console games are usually developed
	for a few console platforms at most, which means that the development costs are mostly associated with the original creation and
	development of the game. However, once developed, mobile games may need to be ported to more than 1,000 different handset models,
	many with different technological requirements. Therefore, the ability to port mobile games quickly and cost effectively can be
	a competitive differentiator among mobile game publishers and a barrier to entry for other potential market entrants.


	 


	The networked nature of mobile games
	allows publishers the opportunity to improve the profitability of a game through decisions on porting, pricing, localization and
	marketing. Some games, especially those tied to films, television shows or console games with specific “day-and-date”
	launch requirements, ideally are launched simultaneously on a global basis with a large number of carriers. Other games may be
	launched in stages by regions or by carriers. These games require initial launch on fewer handsets than games with global “day-and-date”
	launch requirements. Games released in stages offer the opportunity to improve profitability by adjusting porting and marketing
	support costs based upon the initial success of the game.




	Growth Strategy




	The Company’s growth strategy
	involves active review of targeted mobile applications that have high-value elements and low barriers to acquisition. For example,
	Red Fish Holdings’ first acquisition was guided by the recent uptrend in production and popularity of match-three puzzle
	games within the mobile gaming sector. The high-value component being the quality and style of game-play. Vigilant research into
	ongoing trends, both operational and product trends as well as developing trends in marketing and revenue generating strategies
	will guide future growth.


	 


	Once targets are acquired, the Company
	will attempt to market the products into less expensive markets or less saturated markets than U.S.–only markets or social-media
	based platforms and markets like Facebook. Additionally, the Company will seek to expand market visibility of each application
	by ensuring compliance with listing and hosting requirements by Android digital fronts such as Google Play.


	 







	36










	 






	Most mobile application offerings will
	follow a free-to-play model in which users may download the application and play for free with an option to upgrade to a premium
	version or engage in in-app purchases to extend or enhance game play. Such a strategy will seek to grow the user-base of each product
	offering and overall visibility of Red Fish Holdings within the mobile game markets and digital store fronts.



	 





	Market Opportunity:




	The 2015 Global Games Market Report by
	market research and predictive analytics firm Newzoo shows that the worldwide games market will reach $113.3 billion
	by 2018. This represents a 2014 to 2018 

	Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 

	of +7.9%. The market for (smart) phones
	and tablets will rise from $30.0 billion this year to $44.2 billion in 2018, ultimately taking 39% of the global games market.
	In 2015, China and the US are neck and neck for number one market, with China expected to outgrow the US by the smallest of margins:
	$22.2 billion versus $22.0 billion. 


	 


	The Computer Screen (PC/Mac) with $41.2
	billion will account for 36% of the market by 2018 and will remain the most revenue generating screen, growing at a robust CAGR
	of +6.9% driven primarily by PC/MMO games. The Entertainment Screen (TV/Console, VR) with $26.8 billion will have 24% of the market
	by 2018, down from 27% in 2015. Both the Computer Screen and the Entertainment Screen will lose a small portion of their share
	to the continuously growing Personal Screen (Phones, Smartwatches). In 2018, the Personal Screen with $30.2 billion will account
	for 27% of the pie, leaving 13% for the Floating Screen (Tablets, Handhelds). The decline of the handheld console market (CAGR
	of -22.5%) will be offset by the robust growth of tablet revenues (CAGR of +17.1%), resulting in the Floating Screen maintaining
	its market share towards 2018. It was estimated that in 2015, digital game revenues were going to account for 78% of the global
	market totaling $70.9 billion, up from a 74% share in 2014.








	Target Market and Marketing Strategy


	:


	In order to effectively and efficiently
	market our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications in an effort to acquire new users, we will utilize a
	multi-faceted approach as follows:


	 



	-


	              


	Outreach to various technology, business, and gaming blogs and online
	publications.




	-


	              


	Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Cross Platform Advertising.




	-


	              


	Trade shows and other industry gatherings



	 


	The combination of these three
	marketing approaches will, in theory, provide optimal coverage for user acquisition. By utilizing three different approaches, we
	aim to keep our User Acquisition Cost at a lower average price than we would if we utilized only one or two strategies. In addition
	to keeping our User Acquisition Cost low, using multiple different approaches will allow us to better reach our target market of
	14 – 38 year olds as different segments of the target market are accessible via different technologies and advertising media.
	The three approaches are further outlined below:


	 


	Blog Outreach:







	-




	Online blogs offer immense marketing opportunities. We will be able
	to specifically target blogs that write about Technology, Business, and Gaming. By contacting these bloggers to write a review
	about our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming appliactions, we can reach specific groups of people that might become
	potential customers at a lower price and at a much more effective rate than some other forms of advertising such as radio spots
	or newspaper advertisements.





	 


	Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and
	Cross Platform Advertising:







	-




	Pay-Per-Click (PPC) is a model of internet marketing in which advertisers
	pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. One of the most popular forms of PPC, search engine advertising, allows advertisers
	to bid for ad placement in a search engine’s sponsored links when someone searches on a keyword that is related to their
	business offering. Cross Platform advertising, in this case, is extending advertising and marketing efforts to mobile devices for
	inclusion in ‘in-app’ advertising. By utilizing both of these approaches, we can once again make an effort to keep
	customer acquisition cost lower by a) only paying for actual ‘clicks’ instead of impressions, and b) placing our advertising










	37










	 






	directly
	in front of people by placing advertising in apps on mobile devices.


	 


	Trade Shows and Industry
	Gatherings:







	-




	By attending industry trade shows and industry gatherings we will
	be able to showcase our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications to our peers in the technology and gaming
	industries as well as raise awareness for future business to business (B2B) partnerships. B2B partnerships will offer opportunities
	for both new and existing companies in our industry to develop new products that will integrate seamlessly with our software platform.
	Partnerships such as these and others will offer our company even greater visibility to customers.





	 


	 






	Competition




	 


	Our primary industry competitors include
	Digital Chocolate, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, Hands-On Mobile, I-play, Namco and THQ, with Electronic Arts having the
	largest market share of any company in the mobile games market. In the future, likely competitors include major media companies,
	traditional video game publishers, content aggregators, mobile software providers and independent mobile game publishers. Wireless
	carriers may also decide to develop, internally or through a managed third-party developer, and distribute their own mobile games.
	If carriers enter the mobile game market as publishers, they might refuse to distribute some or all of our games or might deny
	us access to all or part of their networks.


	 


	The development, distribution and sale
	of mobile games is a highly competitive business. For end users, we compete primarily on the basis of brand, game quality and price.
	For carriers, we compete for deck placement based on these factors, as well as historical performance and perception of sales potential
	and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on
	royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth
	and relationships with carriers. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.


	 


	Some of our competitors’ and our
	potential competitors’ advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:


	 


		• 	significantly greater
	revenues and financial resources;


	 


		• 	stronger brand and consumer
	recognition regionally or worldwide;


	 






	•


	the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and
	non-mobile products;




	 






	•


	more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having
	to pay royalties;




	 






	•


	pre-existing relationships with brand owners or carriers that afford them access to intellectual
	property while blocking the access of competitors to that same intellectual property;




	 


		• 	greater resources to
	make acquisitions;


	 


		• 	lower labor and development
	costs; and


	 


		• 	broader global distribution
	and presence.


	 


	Further, our capital resources limit
	the number of games that we can develop and market, and any inability to predict successfully the appropriate level of marketing
	investment in each game could result in lower earnings than we anticipate.

	Research & Development




	 


	Red Fish Holdings is not currently engaged
	in any research. Development of the apps, beyond what is currently available in our portfolio, will commence in the coming months.



	 





	Intellectual Property




	 


	The Company itself does not hold any
	intellectual property, besides for the use of its trade name.


	 




	Government Regulation




	 



	We
	do not believe we will require any government approval to sell our products.


	However,

	our
	services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws within various jurisdictions throughout the world and regulations
	prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and
	could interfere with the conduct of our business.



	 






	Employees




	 



	We
	have one employee, our Chief Executive Officer Tom Mahoney. Mr. Mahoney spends at least 80 hours a month on the affairs of the
	company. We will hire necessary personnel based on an as-needed basis only and on a per-contract basis to be compensated directly
	from revenues

	.



	 






	Legal Proceedings




	 


	We know of no existing or pending legal
	proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in
	which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party
	or has a material interest adverse to our interest.



	 






	Properties




	 


	Our principal offices are located at
	1360 Little Duck Cir. Gulf Breeze, FL 32563. The


	 


	 



	DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS,
	AND CONTROL PERSONS



	 


	The board of directors elects our executive
	officers annually. A majority vote of the directors who are in office is required to fill vacancies. Each director shall be elected
	for the term of one year, and until her successor is elected and qualified, or until her earlier resignation or removal. Our directors
	and executive officers are as follows:

	Tom Mahoney, Chief Executive Officer



	Tom Mahoney is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.


	 


	Thomas N. Mahoney, 55 years old, graduated
	with a B.A. in economics from San Diego State University in 1984. Mr. Mahoney acquired his series 7 NASD license and worked for
	Prudential-Bache Securities (now Prudential Securities) from 1985-1990. He was managing director for the MCM Group, a venture capital
	firm in La Jolla, CA helping finance and organize start-ups. Mr. Mahoney then worked for Amber Securities in Taipei, Taiwan from
	1998-2000 to help run an overseas hedge fund. Upon arriving back from Asia, Mr. Mahoney was Managing Director for

	Equititrend
	Advisors from 2001-2013 providing investor relations and corporate finance to large and varied number of public companies.


	 




	Code of Ethics Policy




	We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to
	our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing
	similar functions.



	 





	Board Composition




	 


	Our Bylaws provide that the Board of
	Directors shall consist of no more than three (3) directors. Each director of the Company serves until his successor is elected
	and qualified, subject to removal by the Company’s majority shareholders. Each officer shall hold their offices for such
	terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, and shall hold his
	office until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation or removal.




	 






	Potential Conflicts of Interest





	Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been
	performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors
	and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management
	decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.




	Director Independence





	Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material
	relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. As
	a result of this review, our board of directors determined that our directors do not meet the independence requirements, according
	to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.




	Corporate Governance




	There have been no changes in
	any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having
	no nominating committee for that purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert.
	Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business
	and needs.




	Family Relationships




	None.




	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings




	 


	No officer, director, or persons nominated for such
	positions, promoter or significant employee has been involved in the last ten years in any of the following:






	•


	Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either
	at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time,








	•


	Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and
	other minor offenses),








	•


	Being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent
	jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting her involvement in any type of business,
	securities or banking activities,

	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



	 


	Since inception, we have not paid any
	compensation to our officers or directors. We may elect to award a cash bonus to key employees, directors, officers and consultants
	based on meeting individual and corporate planned objectives.


	 


	We do not have any standard arrangements
	by which directors are compensated for any services provided as a director. No cash has been paid to the directors in their capacity
	as such.



	 





	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
	OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT



	 


	The following tables set forth the ownership,
	as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of
	our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge,
	the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any
	pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.


	 


	The information presented below regarding
	beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial
	owner" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose
	or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the
	right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible
	security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The
	percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially
	owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment
	power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such
	person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such
	percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property
	laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect
	to the shares shown. The business address of the shareholders is1360 Little Duck Cir. Gulf Breeze, FL 32563

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
	ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	The following discussion of our financial
	condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other
	financial information included in this Form S-1. Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that
	are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain
	and risky.


	 


	These risks and uncertainties include
	international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth;
	our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations
	and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant
	customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development
	plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk
	of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filing with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission.


	 


	Although the forward-looking statements
	in this Registration Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and
	factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties,
	the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements.
	You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we
	attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of
	operations and prospects.


	 




	Overview




	 


	We are a developmental stage company
	principally involved in the business of marketing and developing mobile gaming applications to the public. Since inception, we
	have generated no revenue against total expenses of $4,658 for a net loss in the amount of ($4,658). Our expenses are primarily
	attributed to general and administrative expenses as well as those related to the organization of the Company and this offering.
	We have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount of ($4,658) for the period ending October 31, 2015.


	 




	Plan of Operations




	 







	42










	 






	Our plan of operations for the next
	twelve (12) months is as follows:


	 



	Execute capital raise: Months 3




	 



	Estimated Cost: $26,021


	 



	Acquire, develop and launch mobile
	applications, mobile gaming applications and website: Months 6-12



	 


	Acquire mobile applications and mobile
	gaming applications that are already in existence and under-value, hire contractor(s) to further develop our portfolio of mobile
	applications and mobile gaming applications, as well as launch new mobile applications and mobile gaming applications. Develop
	software and purchase appropriate hardware to maintain a network and server.


	 


	Estimated Cost: $100,000


	 



	Market mobile gaming applications:
	Months 9-12



	 


	Marketing the mobile applications and
	mobile gaming applications that we develop is the key component of our growth strategy. This will involve developing and launching
	a multi-faceted online campaign that will incorporate the latest trends in online marketing: web content, ad targeting, and social
	media engagement.


	 


	Estimated Costs: $73,979


	 




	Results of Operations




	 



	Our
	cash balance is $177 as of the period ending October 31, 2015 with $5,035 in liabilities. Our cash balance is not sufficient to
	fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time without further revenue or proceeds from this offering. We may utilize
	funds from Mr. Mahoney our Chief Executive Officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay
	for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Mr. Mahoney, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation
	to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require
	a minimum of $1,000,000 of funding from this offering. After the initial twelve month period we may need additional financing.
	We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.


	We
	incurred expenses of $4,658 which is mainly comprised of professional fees including: legal ($2,500) and accounting ($2,000) fees.
	This constitutes an aggregate loss of $4,658. The maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement
	our business plan.



	 


	If we do not receive any proceeds from
	the offering, we may be compelled to seek a loan from Mr. Mahoney, who has informally agreed to advance us funds. However, he has
	no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company.


	 


	To meet our need for cash we are attempting
	to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this
	offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional
	cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations
	until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely.


	 




	Purchase and Sale of Equipment




	 


	We presently have no equipment.


	 




	Income & Operation Taxes




	 


	We are subject to income taxes in the
	U.S.


	 







	43










	 








	Net Loss




	 


	We incurred net losses of $4,658 for
	the period from inception to October 31, 2015


	 




	Controls and Procedures




	 


	We are not currently required to maintain
	an effective system of internal controls. We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not completed an assessment, nor have
	our auditors tested our systems of internal controls.


	 


	Because it will take time, management
	involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory
	requirements and market expectations for our operations, we may incur significant expense in meeting our public reporting responsibilities,
	particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also
	take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting.


	 


	Once our management’s report on
	internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required
	under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning our operations
	while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting.


	 




	Development Stage and Capital
	Resources




	 


	Since its inception, the Company has
	devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and staff and raising
	capital. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage. The Company has generated no revenues from operations
	and therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves.


	 


	We are attempting to raise funds to
	proceed with our plan of operation. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $1,000,000. We cannot
	guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 months financial requirement. If we are successful,
	any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise
	at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation.


	 


	While we have no revenues as of this
	date, no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our full
	plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand per our business plan. The minimum amount of
	the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material
	costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public
	company will be approximately $25,000.


	 


	We are highly dependent upon the success
	of this offering, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources
	such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because
	we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high
	risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the
	terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities,
	or secure a loan, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment.


	 


	Additionally, the Company will have
	to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s
	management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements,
	especially that of Section 404 of the







	44










	 






	Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to
	implement the business plan and may impede the speed of its operations.

	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION
	ON INDEMNIFICATION




	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant as provided
	in the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
	person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such.

	REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
	PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	KBT


	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholder
	of


	Redfish Holdings, Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying
	balance sheet of Redfish Holdings, Inc. (“the Company”) as of October 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations,
	changes in stockholder's deficit and cash flows for the period from Inception (August 4, 2015) through October 31, 2015. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audit in accordance
	with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
	estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides
	a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Redfish Holdings, Inc. as of October 31,
	2015 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period described above in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
	assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
	not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs and has a working capital deficit. As of October 31, 2015, the
	Company does not have sufficient cash resources to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also
	described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of this uncertainty.

	RED FISH HOLDINGS







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 



	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS
	AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 



	 


	Red Fish Holdings is a Wyoming corporation
	(the “Company”), incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on August 4, 2015. The business plan of the Company
	is to acquire and develop mobile applications as well as assets in the small patented technologies industry.


	 



	Basis of Presentation




	 



	The Company maintains its accounting
	records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S.
	GAAP”).


	 


	These financial statements are presented
	in US dollars.


	 



	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	The principal accounting policies
	are set out below, these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented, unless otherwise stated:



	 



	Fiscal Year End




	 



	The Corporation has adopted a fiscal
	year end of December 31.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.


	 



	Going concern



	The accompanying financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
	the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of October 31, 2015, the Company had a loss from operations
	of $4,658 and earned no revenues since inception and has a working capital deficit of $4,858. The Company intends to fund operations
	through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash
	requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company is dependent upon, among
	other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these
	problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.


	 


	These factors, among others, raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	Cash and equivalents include investments
	with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions
	that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000.


	 



	Property, Plant and Equipment



	On August 30, 2015 the Company acquired
	Dessert Crush Saga, a mobile gaming application, for $700. The funds used to purchase the application were advanced to the Company
	by our Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Mahoney.


	 







	53










	 







	Accounts payable and accrued expenses



	Accounts payable and accrued expenses
	are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the
	financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of
	these goods and services.


	 



	Earnings per share



	The Company computes net loss per share
	in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per
	share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable
	to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
	is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares, which comprise options granted to employees. As at October
	31, 2015, the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The Company measures assets and liabilities
	at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents
	the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction
	between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
	or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value
	on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.


	 


	The following are the hierarchical levels
	of inputs to measure fair value:


	- Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets
	for identical instruments;


	- Level 2: Other significant observable
	inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);


	- Level 3: Significant unobservable
	inputs (including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).


	 



	Contingent Liability



	Where contingent milestone payments
	are due to third parties the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.


	 



	Income taxes



	Income taxes are accounted for in accordance
	with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
	and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for
	deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
	be realized.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
	Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation ("ASUE
	2014-10"). The guidance is intended to reduce the overall cost and complexity associated with financial reporting for development
	stage entities without reducing the availability of relevant information. The Board also believes the changes will simplify the
	consolidation accounting guidance by removing the differential accounting requirements for development stage entities. As a result
	of these changes, there no longer will be any accounting or reporting differences in GAAP between development stage entities and
	other operating entities. For organizations defined as public business entities the presentation and disclosure requirements in
	Topic 915 will no longer be required starting with the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim
	periods therein. Early application is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial
	statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). The Company has
	elected to adopt this guidance as of August 4, 2015.


	 



	Share based payments








	54










	 






	The Company accounts for the issuance
	of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the
	equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments
	issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB. The
	measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment
	for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete.
	In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of
	the consulting agreement.


	 



	NOTE 3 – RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING
	PRONOUNCEMENTS



	During the period ended October 31,
	2015, the Company has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
	(Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to remove the
	inception to date information and all references to development stage.

	UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	(a)(1) To file, during any period in
	which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to:


	 


	(i) 	Include any prospectus required
	by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	 


	(ii) 	To reflect in the prospectus
	any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment
	thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration
	statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of
	securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum
	offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of
	this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate
	offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.


	 


	(iii) 	To include any material information
	with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such
	information in the registration statement;


	 


	(2) That, for the purpose of determining
	any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
	relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial
	bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	(3) To remove from registration by means
	of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	 


	(4) That, for the purpose of determining
	liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	 


	(i) 	If the registrant is subject
	to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other
	than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to
	be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that
	no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated
	or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will,
	as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the
	registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior
	to such date of first use.

	(5) That, for the purpose of determining
	liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The
	undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration
	statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or
	sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser
	and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	 


	(i) 	Any preliminary prospectus or
	prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii) 	Any free writing prospectus
	relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii) 	The portion of any other free
	writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities
	provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) 	Any other communication that
	is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to our directors, officer and controlling persons
	pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officer, or controlling
	persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officer, or controlling
	persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled
	by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy

	to vote may at any time peremptorily terminate the term of office of all or any of the directors by vote at a meeting called for
	such purpose or by a written statement filed with the secretary or, in his absence, with any other officer. Such removal shall
	be effective immediately, even if successors are not elected simultaneously and the vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting
	therefrom shall be filled only by the stockholders.


	 


	A vacancy or vacancies
	in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any directors, or if the authorized
	number of directors be increased, or if the stockholders fail at any annual or special meeting of stockholders at which any director
	or directors are elected to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at that meeting.

	a director or directors at any time to fill any vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors. If the Board of Directors accepts

	a successor to take office when the resignation is to become effective.


	 


	No reduction of the authorized
	number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of his term of office.

	number of directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as hereinafter
	provided. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is
	present shall be regarded as the act of the Board of Directors, unless a greater number be required by law, or by the Articles
	of Incorporation. Any action of a majority, although not at a regularly called meeting, and the record thereof, if assented to
	in writing by all of the other members of the Board shall be as valid and effective in all respects as if passed by the Board in
	regular meeting.


	 


	Section 8.	A quorum of the directors may
	adjourn any directors meeting to meet again at a stated day and hour; provided, however, that in the absence of a quorum, a majority
	of the directors present at any directors meeting, either regular or special, may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed
	for the next regular meeting of the Board.

	a majority of the members or alternate members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority
	of the members or alternate members at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the committee.

	Section 13.	If required by the Board of
	Directors, he shall give the corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the Board
	of Directors for the faithful performance of the duties of his office and for the restoration to the corporation, in case of his
	death, resignation, retirement or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind
	in his possession or under his control belonging to the corporation.


	 


	Section 14.	The

	Assistant Treasurer

	in the order of their seniority, unless otherwise determined by the President or the Board of Directors, shall, in the absence
	or disability of the Treasurer, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Treasurer. They shall perform such other duties
	and have such other powers as the President or the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe.


	 


	ARTICLE IX


	CERTIFICATES OF STOCK


	 


	Section 1.	Every stockholder shall be entitled
	to have a certificate signed by the President or a Vice-President and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary
	or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the corporation. If the corporation
	shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the designations, preferences and
	relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the various classes of stock or series thereof and the qualifications,
	limitations or restrictions of such rights, shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which
	the corporation shall issue to represent such stock.


	 


	Section 2.	If a certificate is signed (a)
	by a transfer agent other than the corporation or its employees or (b) by a registrar other than the corporation or its employees,
	the signatures of the officers of the corporation may be facsimiles. In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature
	has been placed upon a certificate shall cease to be such officer before such certificate is issued, such certificate may be issued
	with the same effect as though the person had not ceased to be such officer. The seal of the corporation, or a facsimile thereof,
	may, but need not be, affixed to certificates of stock.


	 


	Section 3.	The Board of Directors may direct
	a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation
	alleged to have been lost or destroyed upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock
	to be lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion
	and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed certificate or certificates,
	or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or give the corporation a bond in such
	sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged
	to have been lost or destroyed.


	 


	Section 4.	Upon surrender to the corporation
	or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for share duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,
	assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation, if it is satisfied that all provisions of the laws
	and regulations applicable to the corporation regarding transfer and ownership of shares have been complied with, to issue a new
	certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.


	 


	Section 5.	The Board of Directors may fix
	in advance a date not exceeding sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders,
	or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion
	or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining the consent of stockholders for any purpose,
	as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any such meeting, and any adjournment
	thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, or to give such consent, and in such case, such stockholders, and
	only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the date so fixed, shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such
	meeting, or any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise
	such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the corporation
	after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.


	 


	Section 6.	The corporation shall be entitled
	to recognize the person registered on its books as the owner of shares to be the exclusive owner for all purposes including voting
	and dividends, and the corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or
	shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided
	by the laws of Wyoming.


	 


	ARTICLE X


	GENERAL PROVISIONS


	 


	Section 1.	Dividends upon the capital stock
	of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors
	at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of the capital stock,
	subject to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.


	 


	Section 2.	Before payment of any dividend,
	there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time
	to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends
	or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation or for such other purpose as the directors shall think conducive
	to the interest of the corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.


	 


	Section 3.	All checks or demands for money
	and notes of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors
	may from time to time designate.


	 


	Section 4.	The fiscal year of the corporation
	shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.

	seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any manner reproduced.


	 


	ARTICLE XI


	INDEMNIFICATION


	 


	Every person who was or is a party or is threatened
	to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suitor proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
	by reason of the fact that he or a person of whom he is the legal representative is or was a director or officer of the corporation
	or is or was serving at the request of the corporation or for its benefit as a director or officer of another corporation, or as
	its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest
	extent legally permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Wyoming from time to time against all expenses, liability
	and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered
	by him in connection therewith. The expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
	proceeding must be paid by the corporation as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or
	proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined
	by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Such right of indemnification
	shall be a contract right which may be enforced in any manner desired by such person. Such right of indemnification shall not be
	exclusive of any other right which such directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and, without limiting
	the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to their respective rights of indemnification under any bylaw, agreement,
	vote of stockholders, provision of law or otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article.


	 


	The Board of Directors may cause the corporation
	to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was
	serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership,
	joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred in any such capacity or
	arising out of such status, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person.


	 


	The Board of Directors may from time to time
	adopt further Bylaws with respect to indemnification and may amend these and such Bylaws to provide at all times the fullest indemnification
	permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Wyoming.


	 


	ARTICLE XII


	AMENDMENTS


	 


	Section 1.	The Bylaws may be amended by
	a majority vote of all the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders,
	provided notice of intention to amend shall have been contained in the notice of the meeting.


	 


	Section 2.	The Board of Directors by a majority
	vote of the whole Board at any meeting may amend these bylaws, including Bylaws adopted by the stockholders, but the stockholders
	may from time to time specify particular provisions of the Bylaws which shall not be amended by the Board of Directors.

	Re: Opinion of Counsel – Registration Statement on Form S-1


	 


	To the Board of Directors:


	 


	I have been engaged as counsel to Red
	Fish Holdings, Inc. in connection with the preparation and filing of a registration statement on Form S-1. The
	registration statement covers the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of 1,000,000 common shares, par value
	$0.001, to be sold by Red Fish Holdings, Inc. a Wyoming corporation.


	 


	In connection with the opinion contained herein,
	I have examined the registration statement, the articles of incorporation and bylaws, the minutes of meetings of its board of directors,
	as well as all other documents necessary to render an opinion. In my examination, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural
	persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original
	documents of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.


	 


	Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion
	that the 1,000,000 common shares being sold pursuant to the registration statement are duly authorized and will be, when issued
	in the manner described in the registration, legally and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.


	 


	The opinion opines upon the laws of the State
	of Wyoming and reported judicial decisions interpreting those laws. This opinion does not address or relate to any specific state
	securities laws. I assume no duty to communicate with the registrant in respect to any matter that comes to my attention after
	the date of effectiveness of the registration statement.


	 


	I further consent to the use of this opinion
	as an exhibit to the registration statement and to the reference to my firm in the prospectus made part of the registration statement.


	 


	Yours very truly,


	 


	/s/ Adam S. Tracy

	CONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	 


	I have reviewed the entire S-1 filing statement for Red Fish Holdings.


	 


	We have also analyzed the analytical sections
	and their conclusions as derived from the Audited Financial Statements. We are in agreement as to their correctness as presented
	in this document. We hereby consent to the use in their initial Registration Statement pertaining to the registration of 1,000,000
	shares of common stock of Red Fish Holdings of our Audit Report dated December 22, 2015 with respect to the financial statements
	of Red Fish Holdings as of October 31, 2015 and for the period of the Company’s Inception (August 4, 2015), through October
	31, 2015. We also consent to the reference to us as “Experts” in the above referenced Registration Statement.
