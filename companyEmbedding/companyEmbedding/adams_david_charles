Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Georgia:













Does David Charles Adams carry a valid contracting license?



As of July 1, 2008 a majority of contractors performing residential or general contracting work over $2500 must have a professional license issued by the Georgia Secretary of State.
David Charles Adams currently holds license LSIT001047 (Land Surveyor In Training), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Georgia?



A licensed contractor in Georgia must have 2 years of experience, and pass a Georgia business and law exam. A contractor is required to take 3 hours of continuing education each year to maintain a license.











Your liability risk when hiring David Charles Adams



Georgia state law requires licensed contractors to carry general liability as well as workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring David Charles Adams



Georgia does not require contractors to obtain a surety bond. Consumers can file a complaint with the Georgia Governor's office of consumer protection.











What else should I know before hiring David Charles Adams



Licensed contractors in Georgia are required to pass a criminal background check.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Georgia, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner. Choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
