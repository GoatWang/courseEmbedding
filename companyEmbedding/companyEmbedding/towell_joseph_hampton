Restricted Stock Award Dated March 15, 2012 and Executed on April 13, 2012:  Awarded under 2008 Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders May 22, 2008 and pursuant to the Company's 2012 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan.





(2)



Awarded shares can be earned and vest in two tranches and earned shares vest upon the completion of 2-years of service after the earned date for the respective tranche.  However, no Restricted Stock shall be vested prior to the earliest date permitted by Section 111(b)(3)(D) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.  Tranche 1 begins 2012 and a level of the shares, up to half of the awarded amount, has to be earned in a one-year performance period (2012) followed by two additional years of service; thus, shares earned in 2012 will vest at the end of 2014.  Tranche 2 begins in 2012 with 2012 as a year of service, 2013 a year of performance followed by two additional years of service.  Shares earned in 2013 vest at the end of 2015.  No more than the total awarded amount can be earned and vested.
