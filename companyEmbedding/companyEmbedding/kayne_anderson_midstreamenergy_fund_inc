Objective

KMF is a closed-end fund whose investment objective is to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on making quarterly cash distributions to its stockholders. KMF invests principally in securities of companies in the Midstream/Energy Sector, consisting of: (a) Midstream MLPs, (b) Midstream Companies, (c) Other MLPs and (d) Other Energy Companies. KMF anticipates that the majority of its investments will consist of equity investments in Midstream MLPs and Midstream Companies.



Investment Merits

Midstream Opportunities
- Opportunity to invest across the full value chain for the Midstream Sector through investments in Midstream Master Limited Partnerships ("MLPs") and Midstream Companies- Midstream Sector generates attractive risk-adjusted returns and has stable characteristics- Development of "unconventional reserves" is changing the North American energy industry, driving the need for new Midstream assets and creating significant growth opportunities for the Midstream sector
Attractive Fund Structure
- KMF issues a Form 1099 (no K-1).- Suitable for IRAs, foundations and tax-exempt accounts, because unlike direct holdings in MLPs, KMF does not generate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI).- KMF is a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) and, as such, does not pay income taxes at the fund level.
Access to Private Investments
KMF provides access to private investment opportunities not available to retail investors.

Quarterly Distributions per Share
 
View the complete Distribution History for KMF.

Information on Tax Character of Distributions
Our distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income (a portion of which may be qualified dividends) or capital gains. Distributions of our ordinary income plus net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. If our distributions exceed our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a return of capital to our common stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s basis in our common stock, and then the amount distributed in excess of such stockholder’s basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Common stockholders will receive a Form 1099 from us and will recognize ordinary income only to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Because the cash distributions received from the MLPs in our portfolio are expected to exceed the earnings and profits associated with owning such MLPs, a portion of our distributions may be paid from sources other than our current and accumulated earnings and profits. The table below summarizes the tax character of our distributions since inception. Sample Form 1099-DIV for each year can be found at www.kaynefunds.com/kmf/tax-information.

This table illustrates the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund's common shares beginning on the inception date with all distributions reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). Ending values as of the dates shown in the table. Performance does not reflect transaction fees or broker commissions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.





1) Payable on 7/14/17 (ex-date 7/6/17) for the quarter ended 5/31/17. (See “Information on Tax Character of Distributions” on page 2.)2) Assumes that distributions have been reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP).
 
3) As of May 31, 2017, this estimate is based on our estimated earnings and profits for fiscal 2017. The final determination of the tax character of our distributions will be made after our fiscal year-end when we can determine our actual earnings and profits for the full year. The final tax status of our distributions is dependent on our earnings and profits (including gains and losses on the sale of securities) for the remainder of our fiscal year and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.
This material shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale is not permitted. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. An investment in the fund could suffer loss. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown based on market fluctuations from the end of the reported period. Before making an investment in the fund, you should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the fund, which, together with and other important information are included in the fund's most recent prospectus and other filings with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objectives will be attained. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares, and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

	Each director serves a three-year term until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the designated year and until his or her successor has been duly elected and
	qualified.






	Pursuant to the terms of each Companys mandatory redeemable preferred stock (the
	Preferred Stock), the holders of Preferred Stock are entitled as a class, to the exclusion of the holders of the Companys common stock (the Common Stock), to elect two directors of the Company (the Preferred
	Directors). The KMF Board has designated William L. Thacker and Albert L. Richey as the Preferred Directors, and the KED Board has designated James C. Baker and Terry A. Hart as the Preferred Directors. The terms of the Preferred Stock for
	each Company further provide that the remaining nominees shall be elected by holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock voting together as a single class. Of those designated as Preferred Directors, Mr. Hart is the sole Preferred Director whose
	term is expiring at this years Annual Meeting.

	Table of Contents




	The following tables set forth the nominees and each remaining
	directors name and year of birth; position(s) with each Company and length of time served; principal occupations during the past five years; and other directorships held during the past five years. The address for the nominees and directors is
	811 Main Street, 14



	th



	Floor, Houston, TX 77002.




	The term Independent Director is used to refer to a director who is not an interested person, as
	defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), of the Company, of Kayne Anderson or of the Companys underwriters in offerings of its securities from time to time as defined in the 1940 Act. None of the
	Independent Directors nor any of their immediate family members, has ever been a director, officer or employee of Kayne Anderson or its affiliates. Kevin S. McCarthy, James C. Baker and Terry A. Hart are interested persons or
	Interested Directors by virtue of their employment relationships with Kayne Anderson.




	The Board of Directors of
	each Company has adopted a mandatory retirement policy. No director may be nominated or stand for re-election if that director would have his or her 72nd birthday before the stockholders meeting at which that director would be elected. Once
	elected, a director may complete his or her term even if that director turns 72 during such term.




	For information regarding
	each Companys executive officers and their compensation, please refer to Information About Executive Officers and Compensation Discussion and Analysis.




	In addition to serving on the Boards of Directors of KMF and KED, Mr. McCarthy also serves on the Board of Directors of Kayne
	Anderson MLP Investment Company (KYN) and Kayne Anderson Energy Total Return Fund, Inc. (KYE). KYN, KYE, KMF and KED are closed-end investment companies registered under the 1940 Act that are advised by KAFA.

	and the valuation of the Companys securities in accordance with such procedures. The Valuation Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Companies website
	(www.kaynefunds.com).

	Nominating, Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee

	(Nominating Committee).    The Nominating Committee
	is responsible for appointing and nominating Independent Directors to the Board. Each Nominating Committee member is independent under the applicable NYSE listing standards. The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter
	adopted and approved by the Board (the Nominating Committee Charter), a copy of which is available on the Companies website (www.kaynefunds.com). The Nominating Committee has not established specific, minimum qualifications that
	must be met by an individual for the Committee to recommend that individual for nomination as a director. The Nominating Committee expects to seek referrals for candidates to consider for nomination from a variety of sources, including current
	directors, the Companys management, investment adviser and counsel, will consider nominees properly recommended by







	 




	12








	Table of Contents






	 





	stockholders, and may also engage a search firm to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating candidates. As set forth in the Nominating Committee Charter, in evaluating
	candidates for a position on the Board, the Committee considers a variety of factors, including, as appropriate:






	 





	 




	




	 





	the candidates knowledge in matters relating to the investment company or to the energy industry;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any experience possessed by the candidate as a director or senior officer of public companies;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the candidates educational background;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the candidates reputation for high ethical standards and personal and professional integrity;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any specific financial, technical or other expertise possessed by the candidate, and the extent to which such expertise would complement the
	Boards existing mix of skills and qualifications;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the candidates perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the Board, including the candidates ability and commitment to
	attend meetings regularly and work collaboratively with other members of the Board;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the candidates ability to qualify as an independent director for purposes of the 1940 Act, the candidates independence from the
	Companys service providers and the existence of any other relationships that might give rise to a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	such other factors as the Nominating Committee determines to be relevant in light of the existing composition of the Board and any anticipated
	vacancies or other transitions (e.g., whether or not a candidate is an audit committee financial expert under the federal securities laws).







	The Nominating Committee also considers diversity, including gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience, skills and viewpoints in identifying nominees for director. The
	Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board and the Nominating Committee believe that it is important that the Board members represent diverse skills, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.




	Prior to making a final recommendation to the Board, the Nominating Committee of each Company may conduct personal interviews
	with the candidates it believes to be the most qualified.




	If there is no vacancy on the Board, the Board will not actively
	seek recommendations from other parties, including stockholders. When a vacancy on the Board occurs and nominations are sought to fill such vacancy, the Nominating Committee may seek nominations from those sources it deems appropriate in its
	discretion, including the Companys stockholders.




	The Nominating Committee considers nominees
	properly recommended by stockholders. To submit a recommendation for nomination as a candidate for a position on the Board of either Company, stockholders of such Company shall mail the recommendation to the Secretary of the Company at 811 Main
	Street, 14



	th



	Floor, Houston, TX 77002. Such recommendation
	shall include the following information: (a) evidence of stock ownership of the person or entity recommending the candidate; (b) a full description of the proposed candidates background, including his or her education, experience,
	current employment, and date of birth; (c) names and addresses of at least three professional references for the candidate; (d) information as to whether the candidate is an interested person in relation to the Company, as such
	term is defined in the 1940 Act, and such other information that may be considered to impair the candidates independence; and (e) any other information that may be helpful to the Nominating Committee in evaluating the candidate.




	Any such recommendation must contain sufficient background information concerning the candidate to enable the Companys
	Nominating Committee to make a proper judgment as to the candidates qualifications. If a recommendation is received with satisfactorily completed information regarding a candidate

	Table of Contents




	during a time when a vacancy exists on the Board or during such other time as the Nominating Committee is accepting recommendations, the recommendation will be forwarded to the Chair of the
	Nominating Committee and will be evaluated in the same manner as other candidates for nomination. Recommendations received at any other time will be kept on file until such time as the Nominating Committee is accepting recommendations, at which
	point they may be considered for nomination.

	INFORMATION ABOUT EACH DIRECTORS QUALIFICATIONS,






	EXPERIENCE, ATTRIBUTES OR SKILLS





	The Board of each Company believes that each of its directors has the qualifications, experience, attributes and skills (Director Attributes) appropriate to their continued service as
	directors of the Company in light of the Companys business and structure. Each of the directors has a demonstrated record of business and/or professional accomplishment that indicates that they have the ability to critically review, evaluate
	and access information provided to them. Certain of these business and professional experiences are set forth in detail in the tables above under Information Regarding Nominee and Directors. Each of the directors has served on the Boards
	of both Companies for a number of years. In addition, many of the directors have served as members of the board of other public companies, non-profit entities or other organizations. They therefore have substantial boardroom experience and, in their
	service to both Companies, have gained substantial insight as to the operation of the Companies and have demonstrated a commitment to discharging oversight duties as directors in the interests of stockholders.




	In addition to the information provided in the tables above, certain additional information regarding the directors and their Director
	Attributes is provided below. The information provided below, and in the tables above, is not all-inclusive. Many Director Attributes involve intangible elements, such as intelligence, integrity and work ethic, along with the ability to work with
	other members of the Board, to communicate effectively, to exercise judgment and to ask incisive questions, and commitment to stockholder interests. The Board of each Company annually conducts a self-assessment wherein the effectiveness of the Board
	and individual directors is reviewed. In conducting its annual self-assessment, each Board has determined that the directors have the appropriate attributes and experience to continue to serve effectively as directors of the Company.

	    Mr. McCarthy is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of both Companies. In this
	position, Mr. McCarthy has extensive knowledge of each Company, its operations, personnel and financial resources. Prior to joining Kayne Anderson in 2004, Mr. McCarthy was most recently global head of energy at UBS Securities LLC. In this

	Companys Audit Committee has considered the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to KAFA and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with KAFA that provides ongoing services to the Company that were not
	pre-approved by the Audit Committee and has determined that the provision of such non-audit services is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs independence.

	Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures





	Before the auditor for each Company is engaged by the Company to render audit, audit-related or permissible non-audit services to the
	Company, either: (a) the Audit Committee shall pre-approve such engagement; or (b) such engagement shall be entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee. Before any non-audit services may
	be provided by the auditor to Kayne Anderson or any entity in the investment company complex (i.e., the Company, Kayne Anderson and any entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with Kayne Anderson if such entity is an investment
	adviser or is engaged in the business of providing administrative, custodian, underwriting or transfer agent services to the Company or Kayne Anderson), if the nature of the services to be provided relate directly to the Companys operations or
	financial reporting, such non-audit services must be preapproved by the Audit Committee. Any pre-approval policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee must be detailed as to the particular service and not involve any delegation of the
	Audit Committees responsibilities to Kayne Anderson. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more of its members the authority to grant pre-approvals. The pre-approval policies and procedures shall include the requirement that the decisions
	of any member to whom authority is delegated under this provision shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Under certain limited circumstances, pre-approvals are not required if certain

	de minimis

	thresholds are not exceeded, as such thresholds are set forth by the Audit Committee and in accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations.




	For engagements with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Audit Committee of each Company approved in advance all audit services and non-audit services, if any, that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided to the
	Company and to Kayne Anderson (with respect to the Companys operations and financial reporting). None of the services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the Company or Kayne Anderson were pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to
	the pre-approval exception under Rule 2.01(c)(7)(i)(C) or Rule 2.01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. The Audit Committee has considered and concluded that the provision of non-audit services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to Kayne Anderson and
	any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Kayne Anderson that were not required to be preapproved by the Audit Committee is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs independence.










	JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT





	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board) of each of Kayne Anderson Midstream/Energy Fund, Inc. and Kayne Anderson Energy Development Company (each, a Company) is
	responsible for assisting the Board in monitoring (1) the accounting and reporting policies and procedures of the Company, (2) the quality and integrity of the Companys financial statements, (3) the Companys compliance
	with regulatory requirements, and (4) the independence and performance of the Companys independent auditors and any internal auditors. Among other responsibilities, the Audit Committee of each Company reviews, in its oversight capacity,
	the Companys annual financial statements with both management and the independent auditors, and the Audit Committee of each Company meets periodically with the independent auditors and any internal auditors to consider their evaluation of the
	Companys financial and internal controls. The Audit Committee of each Company also selects, retains and evaluates and may replace the Companys independent auditors and determines their compensation, subject to ratification of the Board,
	if required. The Audit Committee of each Company is currently composed of four directors. The Audit Committee of each Company operates under a written charter (the Audit Committee Charter) adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of
	which is available on the Companies website (www.kaynefunds.com). Each Audit Committee member is independent as defined by New York Stock Exchange listing standards.




	The Audit Committee of each Company, in discharging its duties, has met with and held discussions with management and the Companys
	independent auditors and any internal auditors. The Audit Committee

	Table of Contents




	of each Company has reviewed and discussed the Companys audited financial statements with management. Management has represented to the independent auditors that the Companys
	financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The Audit Committee of each Company has also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard
	No. 1301,

	Communications with Audit Committees,

	as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee of each Company has received the written disclosures and the letter from the Companys independent
	auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors communications with the Audit Committee of each Company concerning independence, and has discussed with the
	independent auditors the independent auditors independence. As provided in the Audit Committee Charter of each Company, it is not the Audit Committees responsibility to determine, and the considerations and discussions referenced above
	do not ensure, that the Companys financial statements are complete and accurate and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.




	Based on each Companys Audit Committees review and discussions with management and the independent auditors, the representations of management and the report of the independent auditors to
	each Companys Audit Committee, the Audit Committee of each Company has recommended that its Board include the audited financial statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form N-CSR for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 filed
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission.





	Submitted by the Audit Committee of each Company:





	William R. Cordes




	Barry R. Pearl




	Albert L. Richey




	William L. Thacker

	COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS





	Pursuant to an investment management agreement between each Company and KAFA (the Companies external manager), KAFA is responsible
	for supervising the investments and reinvestments of each Companys assets. KAFA, at its own expense, maintains staff and employs personnel as it determines is necessary to perform its obligations under the investment management agreement. Each
	Company pays various management fees to KAFA for the advisory and other services performed by KAFA under the investment management agreement.




	The executive officers who manage each Companys regular business are employees of KAFA or its affiliates. Accordingly, neither Company pays salaries, bonuses or other compensation to its executive
	officers. Neither Company has employment agreements with its executive officers. Neither Company provides pension or retirement benefits, perquisites, or other personal benefits to its executive officers. Neither Company maintains compensation plans
	under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance. Neither Company has arrangements to make payments to its executive officers upon their termination or in the event of a change in control of the Company.




	The investment management agreement for each Company does not require KAFA to dedicate specific personnel to fulfilling its obligation to
	the Company under the investment management agreement, or require KAFA personnel to dedicate a specific amount of time to the management of the Company. In their capacities as executive officers or employees of KAFA or its affiliates, they devote
	such portion of their time to the Companys affairs as required for the performance of KAFAs duties under the investment management agreement.




	The executive officers for both Companies are compensated by KAFA. The Companies understand that KAFA takes into account the performance of each Company as a factor in determining the compensation of
	certain of its senior managers, and such compensation may be increased depending on the Companys performance. In addition to compensation for services performed for each Company, certain of the executive officers receive compensation for
	services performed for KAFAs various investment funds. However, KAFA cannot segregate and identify that portion of the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to each Companys executive officers that relates exclusively to their
	services to each Company.

	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS





	The following tables set forth the number of shares of each Companys Common Stock and Preferred Stock (as of
	March 31, 2017) beneficially owned by each Companys current directors and executive officers as a group, and certain other beneficial owners, according to information furnished to each Company by such persons. Based on statements publicly
	filed with the SEC and other information obtained from such persons, as of March 31, 2017, no persons beneficially owned more than 5% of KMFs outstanding Common Stock and two persons beneficially owned more than 5% of KEDs
	outstanding Common Stock. As of March 31, 2017, KMF is aware of two persons who beneficially own more than 5% of its outstanding Preferred Stock, and KED is aware of one person who beneficially owns more than 5% of its outstanding Preferred
	Stock. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act and, unless indicated otherwise, includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities.

	For each Company as of March 31, 2017, the Independent Directors of both Companies and
	their respective immediate family members did not own beneficially or of record any class of securities of Kayne Anderson or any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Kayne Anderson. As of
	March 31, 2017, the Independent Directors of both Companies did not own beneficially or of record any class of securities of the underwriters of the offerings of either Companys Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any class of securities
	of any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such underwriters.




	As of
	March 31, 2017, certain officers and certain employees of Kayne Anderson, including all the executive officers of each Company, own, in the aggregate, approximately $6 million of KMFs Common Stock and approximately $4 million of
	KEDs Common Stock.







	SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE





	For each Company, Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act and Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act require the
	Companys directors and executive officers, investment adviser, affiliated persons of the investment adviser and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Companys equity securities to file Section 16(a) forms with
	the SEC and NYSE reporting their affiliation with the Company, their ownership and changes in their ownership of the Companys shares. Those persons and entities are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all
	Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of those Section 16(a) forms furnished to it, each Company believes that its directors and executive officers, KAFA, affiliated persons of KAFA, and any persons holding more than 10%
	of the Companys Preferred Stock have complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements during the last fiscal year. To the knowledge of each Companys management, no person owned beneficially more than 10% of the
	KMFs Common Stock and one person owned beneficially more than 10% of KEDs Common Stock during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016.

	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE






	Board Leadership Structure





	Each Companys business and affairs are managed under the direction of its Board, including the duties performed for the Company pursuant to its investment management agreement. Among other things,
	the Board of each Company sets broad policies for the Company, approves the appointment of the Companys investment adviser, administrator and officers, and approves the engagement, and reviews the performance of the Companys independent
	registered public accounting firm. The role of the Board of each Company and of any individual director is one of oversight and not of management of the day-to-day affairs of the Company.




	The Board of KMF currently consists of five directors, four of whom are Independent Directors. The Board of KED currently consists of
	seven directors, four of whom are Independent Directors. As part of each regular Board meeting for each Company, the Independent Directors meet separately from Kayne Anderson and, as part of at least one Board meeting each year, with the
	Companys Chief Compliance Officer. The Board of each Company reviews its leadership structure periodically as part of its annual self-assessment process and believes that its structure is appropriate to enable the Board to exercise its
	oversight of the Company.




	Under each Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Board of each Company may designate a
	Chairman to preside over meetings of the Board and meetings of stockholders, and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the Board. Neither Company has an established policy as to whether the Chairman of the Board shall be
	an Independent Director and believes that having the flexibility to designate its Chairman and reorganize its leadership structure from time to time is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.




	Presently, Mr. McCarthy serves as Chairman of the Board of each Company. Mr. McCarthy is an interested person of
	each Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, by virtue of his employment relationship with Kayne Anderson. Each Company believes that Mr. McCarthys history with the Company, familiarity with the Kayne Anderson investment platform and
	extensive experience in the field of energy-related investments qualifies him to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Each Board has determined that the composition of the Audit and Nominating Committees being Independent Directors only is an
	appropriate means to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from the Chairmans status as an interested person of the Company. Each Board believes that its Board leadership structure  having the Chief
	Executive Officer serve as Chairman of the Board and Audit and Nominating Committees comprised solely of Independent Directors  is the optimal structure for the Company at this time. Because the Chief Executive Officer has the most
	extensive knowledge of the various aspects of each Companys business and is directly involved in managing both the day-to-day operations and long-term strategy of each Company, each Board has determined that Mr. McCarthy is the most
	qualified individual to lead the Board and serve in the key position as Chairman. Each Board has also concluded that this structure allows for efficient and effective communication with the Board.




	Currently, neither Companys Board has a designated lead Independent Director. Instead, all of the Independent Directors play an
	active role serving on the Board. The Independent Directors constitute a majority of each Companys Board and are closely involved in all material deliberations related to the Company. The Board of each Company believes that, with these
	practices, each Independent Director has an equal stake in the Boards actions and oversight role and equal accountability to the Company and its stockholders.

	Board Role in Risk Oversight





	Each Companys Board oversees the services provided by Kayne Anderson, including certain risk management functions. Risk management is a broad concept comprised of many disparate elements (such as,
	for example, investment risk, issuer and counterparty risk, compliance risk, operational risk and business continuity risk). Consequently, Board oversight of different types of risks is handled in different ways, and the Board of each Company
	implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through Board committees. In the course of providing oversight, each Board and its committees receive reports on the Companys activities, including those related to the Companys
	investment portfolio and its financial accounting and reporting. Each Board also meets at least quarterly with the Companys Chief Compliance Officer, who reports on the compliance of the Company with the federal securities laws and the
	Companys internal compliance policies and procedures. The meetings of the Audit Committee of each Company with the Companys independent registered public accounting firm also contribute to Board oversight of certain internal control
	risks. In addition, each Board meets periodically with representatives of the Company and Kayne Anderson to receive reports regarding the management of the Company, including those related to certain investment and operational risks, and the
	Independent Directors of each Company are encouraged to communicate directly with senior management.




	Each Company believes
	that Board roles in risk oversight must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that the Boards existing role in risk oversight is appropriate. Management believes that each Company has robust internal processes in place and a strong internal
	control environment to identify and manage risks. However, not all risks that may affect a Company can be identified or processes and controls developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects, and some risks are beyond any control of
	the Company or Kayne Anderson, its affiliates or other service providers.





	Diversity in Nominees for Director





	The Nominating Committee of each Company evaluates candidates qualifications for Board membership. The Nominating Committee of each
	Company takes into account the diversity of a particular candidate and the overall diversity of the Board when considering and evaluating candidates for Director. While the Nominating Committee of each Company has not adopted a particular definition
	of diversity or a particular policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying candidates, when considering a candidates and the Boards diversity, the Nominating Committee generally considers the manner in which each
	candidates leadership, independence, interpersonal skills, financial acumen, integrity and professional ethics, educational and professional background, prior director or executive experience, industry knowledge, business judgment and specific
	experiences or expertise would compliment or benefit the Board and, as a whole, contribute to the ability of the Board to oversee the Company. The Nominating Committee of each Company may also consider other factors or attributes as it may determine
	appropriate in its judgment. The Nominating Committee of each Company believes that the significance of each candidates background, experience, qualifications, attributes or skills must be considered in the context of the Board as a whole. As
	a result, the Nominating Committee of each Company has not established any litmus test or quota relating to diversity that must be satisfied before an individual may serve as a director. Each Board believes that Board effectiveness is best evaluated
	at a group level, through its annual self-assessment process. Through this process, each Board considers whether the Board as a whole has an appropriate level of sophistication, skill and business acumen and the appropriate range of experience and
	background.





	Communications Between Stockholders and the Board of Directors





	Stockholders of either Company may send communications to the Companys Board. Communications should be
	addressed to the Secretary of each Company at 811 Main Street, 14



	th



	Floor, Houston, TX 77002. The Secretary of each Company will forward any communications received directly to that Companys Board.

	Table of Contents





	Code of Ethics





	Each Company has adopted a code of ethics, as required by federal securities laws, which applies to, among others, its directors and officers. Text-only versions of the code of ethics of each Company are
	available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs internet web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, copies of the code of ethics of each Company may be obtained from the Company free of charge at (877) 657-3863.










	OTHER MATTERS





	Each Companys Board knows of no other matters that are intended to be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the proxies named in the enclosed
	form of proxy will vote on those matters in their sole discretion.

	How Proxies Will Be Voted





	For each Company, all proxies solicited by the Board of Directors that are properly executed and received at or prior to the Annual Meeting, and that are not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting.
	Votes will be cast in accordance with the instructions marked on the enclosed proxy card. If no instructions are specified, the persons named as proxies will cast such votes in accordance with each Boards recommendations. The Companies know of
	no other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting. However, if other proposals are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the votes entitled to be cast by the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will cast such votes in their
	sole discretion.

	Table of Contents





	How to Vote





	If your shares in either Company are held in Street Name by a broker or bank, you will receive information regarding how to instruct your bank or broker to cast your votes. If you are a
	stockholder of record of either Company, you may authorize the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card to cast the votes you are entitled to cast at the meeting by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card. For
	either Company, stockholders of record or their duly authorized proxies may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. However, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you should still return your proxy card, which will ensure that your vote is
	cast should your plans change.





	Expenses and Solicitation of Proxies





	For each Company, the expenses of preparing, printing and mailing the enclosed proxy card, the accompanying notice and this proxy
	statement, tabulation expenses and all other costs in connection with the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. Each Company may also reimburse banks, brokers and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation
	material to the beneficial owners of the Companys shares. In order to obtain the necessary quorum at the meeting, additional solicitation may be made by mail, telephone, telegraph, facsimile or personal interview by each Companys
	representatives, Kayne Anderson, the Companys transfer agent, or by brokers or their representatives or by a solicitation firm that may be engaged by the Company to assist in proxy solicitations. If a proxy solicitor is retained by either
	Company, the costs associated with all proxy solicitation are expected to be approximately $5,000 for each Company. The Company will not pay any of its representatives or Kayne Anderson any additional compensation for their efforts to supplement
	proxy solicitation.





	Dissenters or Appraisal Rights





	Stockholders of either Company do not have dissenters or appraisal rights.





	Revoking a
	Proxy





	At any time before it has been voted, you may revoke your proxy for either Company by:
	(1) sending a letter revoking your proxy to the Secretary of the Company at 811 Main Street, 14



	th



	Floor, Houston, TX 77002; (2) properly executing and sending a later-dated proxy to the Secretary of the Company at the same address; or (3) attending the Annual Meeting, requesting return
	of any previously delivered proxy, and voting in person.





	Broker Non-Votes





	Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares held in street name does not give instructions to the broker holding
	the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed non-routine. Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to give voting instructions to the broker holding the shares. If the beneficial
	owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be routine, but cannot vote the shares with respect to non-routine matters. Under the rules and
	interpretations of the NYSE, non-routine matters are generally matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders. The ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm is
	generally considered to be routine, and brokers generally have discretionary voting power with respect to such proposal.





	Quorum and Adjournment





	For each Company, the presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
	(without regard to class) constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the Annual




	 




	30








	Table of Contents




	Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. For each Company, if a quorum is not present in person or
	by proxy at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the Annual Meeting may adjourn the meeting to a date not more than 120 days after the original Record Date without notice other than announcement at the Annual Meeting.







	INVESTMENT ADVISER





	KA Fund Advisors, LLC is the investment adviser for each Company. Its principal office is located at 811 Main Street,
	14



	th



	Floor, Houston, TX 77002.







	ADMINISTRATOR





	Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC (the Administrator) provides certain administrative services for each Company, including but not limited to preparing and maintaining books, records, and tax and
	financial reports, and monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements. The Administrator is located at 225 Pictoria Drive, Suite 450, Cincinnati, OH 45246.







	HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS





	The SEC has
	adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g. brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy
	statement and annual report addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as householding, potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.




	This year, for each Company, a number of brokers with account holders who are the Companys stockholders will be
	householding its proxy materials. These brokers will deliver a single copy of the proxy statement and other proxy materials to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless the brokers have received contrary instructions from the
	affected stockholders. If you have received notice from your broker that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent.
	If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate copy of proxy materials and annual report, please notify your broker. Stockholders of each Company sharing an address who currently
	receive multiple copies of proxy materials and annual report of either Company at the same addresses and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their brokers.

	STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS





	The Amended and Restated Bylaws currently in effect for each Company provide that in order for a stockholder to
	nominate a candidate for election as a director at an annual meeting of stockholders or propose business for consideration at such meeting, which nomination or proposal is not to be included in the Companys proxy statement, written notice
	containing the information required by the current Bylaws must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at 811 Main Street, 14



	th



	Floor, Houston, TX 77002, not later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the 120th day, and not earlier than the 150th day,
	prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the preceding years annual meeting;

	provided, however,

	that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the
	first anniversary of the date of the preceding years annual meeting (and in the case of the first annual meeting of stockholders), notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 150th day prior to the date of
	such annual meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the later of the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.




	Accordingly, a stockholder nomination or proposal for either Company intended to be considered at the 2018 Annual Meeting must
	be received by the Secretary of the Company on or after December 29, 2017 and prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Time on January 30, 2018. However, under the rules of the SEC, if a stockholder wishes to submit a proposal for possible inclusion in
	the 2018 proxy statement pursuant to Rule

	14a-8(e)

	of the 1934 Act, the Company must receive it not fewer than 120 calendar days before the anniversary of the date the proxy statement was released to
	stockholders for the previous years annual meeting. Accordingly, a stockholders proposal under Rule 14a-8(e) must be received by the Company on or before January 30, 2018 in order to be included in the proxy statement and proxy card
	for the 2018 Annual Meeting. All nominations and proposals must be in writing.
