SAN DIEGO and AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (Mast, NYSE MKT: MSTX) and Savara Inc. (Savara), a privately-held emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of rare respiratory diseases, today announced that the two companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which the stockholders of Savara would become the majority owners of Mast, and the operations of Mast and Savara would be combined. Subject to stockholder approval, the combined company will advance a pipeline of novel inhalation therapies for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical needs, featuring three product candidates, each in advanced clinical development.  













                Savara Inc.
              

 
 



The combined company pipeline will include: 

AeroVanc, an inhaled dry-powder vancomycin to treat chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) in preparation for a pivotal Phase 3 study 
Molgradex, an inhaled nebulized GM-CSF to treat pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) currently in Phase 2/3 development 
AIR001, an inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite solution to treat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) currently in Phase 2 development  

"Following an extensive review of strategic alternatives and a thorough process, the Mast Board of Directors chose to combine with Savara because we believe the proposed merger provides an attractive opportunity for our shareholders to obtain value appreciation from a diversified pipeline and positions the company for more rapid short- and long-term growth via a triad of late-stage clinical assets with important forthcoming milestones," stated Brian M. Culley, current Chief Executive Officer and Director of Mast Therapeutics. "We are excited for the prospects of the combined company and believe that Savara's management team is well equipped to advance the pipeline toward regulatory approvals and commercialization in the US and EU."
Rob Neville, Chairman and CEO of Savara added, "This merger is transformative for Savara and marks our second transaction in a year, each expanding Savara's pipeline of inhaled therapies for serious and life-threatening diseases. AeroVanc and Molgradex are orphan-designated product candidates in late-stage development, and we see Mast's AIR001 program potentially adding significant value to our pipeline with a modest capital outlay in 2017. We believe the favorable risk profile of our product candidates combined with their market potential provides a unique opportunity for Savara to become the next breakout company in orphan pulmonary diseases." 
Select Anticipated Upcoming Development Milestones

Initiate a pivotal Phase 3 study of AeroVanc for the treatment of MRSA in CF patients in Q3/2017. 
Announce top-line results from a registration-enabling Phase 2/3 study of Molgradex for the treatment of PAP currently ongoing for Europe and Japan in Q1/2018. 
Complete negotiations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the requirements for a pivotal clinical study of Molgradex in the U.S. in Q3/2017. 
Announce results from an ongoing 100-patient Phase 2 study of AIR001 for the treatment of HFpEF being conducted by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network in Q1/2018.

About the Proposed Merger
Under the terms of the merger agreement, pending stockholder approval of the transaction, Savara stockholders will receive newly issued shares of Mast common stock in exchange for their Savara stock. The exchange ratio was determined using a pre-transaction valuation of $115 million for Savara's business, based on its latest priced investment round and an acquisition of assets of Serendex Pharmaceuticals A/S, and $36.5 million for Mast's business, a premium to the 20-day volume weighted average share price of Mast. As a result, current Mast stockholders will collectively own approximately 24%, and Savara stockholders will collectively own approximately 76%, of the combined company on a pro-forma basis, subject to adjustment based on Mast's net cash balance and Mast's and Savara's capitalization at closing. 
The combined company, led by Savara's current management team, is expected to be named Savara Inc. and be headquartered in Austin, TX.  Prior to closing, Mast will seek stockholder approval to conduct a reverse split of its outstanding shares to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE MKT. The combined company is expected to trade on the NYSE MKT under a new ticker symbol. At closing, the combined company's board of directors is expected to consist of seven members, including five members of Savara's current board and two members of Mast's current board. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company. The transaction is expected to close by the second quarter of 2017, subject to approvals by the stockholders of Mast and Savara, and other customary closing conditions. 
Mast's financial advisor in the transaction is Roth Capital Partners. Canaccord Genuity Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Savara. DLA Piper LLP (US) is serving as legal counsel to Mast and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. is serving as legal counsel to Savara.
Conference Call and Webcast   Mast and Savara will hold a conference call Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time / 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time to discuss the proposed transaction.  Interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (855) 239-3120 from the U.S., (855) 669-9657 from Canada, and (412) 542-4127 from outside the U.S. and should request the Mast-Savara Conference Call.

We initially are developing MST-188 as a treatment for complications arising from sickle cell disease.   Learn more about MST-188.  	    AIR001   This page contains Forward Looking Statements.* AIR001 is a sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation via nebulizer. Nitrite is a direct vasodilator and can be recycled in vivo to form nitric oxide (NO) independent of the classical NO synthase (NOS) pathway. Nitrite mediated NO formation has several beneficial effects, including dilation of blood vessels and reduction of inflammation and undesirable cell growth. Generation of NO from sodium nitrite is not dependent upon endothelial function and is enhanced in the setting of tissue hypoxia and acidosis, conditions in which NOS activity typically is depressed. In early clinical studies, AIR001 demonstrated positive hemodynamic effects with reductions observed in right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as well as improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac output. We are developing AIR001 for treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a condition that affects millions in the U.S. and for which no proven therapeutic agent is available. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that HFpEF is a disease of NO deficiency. We are supporting two institution-sponsored Phase 2a studies in patients with HFpEF to evaluate acute hemodynamic effects of AIR001 and to evaluate its acute effects versus placebo on submaximal oxygen consumption and exercise hemodynamics.  How Does AIR001 Work?    AIR001 Inhalation Solution is sodium nitrite formulated with a phosphate buffer into an inhalation solution. Nitrite is a physiological signaling molecule with roles in intravascular endocrine nitric oxide (NO) production, hypoxic vasodilation, signaling, and cytoprotection after ischemia-reperfusion. Nitrite serves as the largest physiologic reservoir of NO and can be converted to NO independent of NO synthase (NOS) activity. In experimental models, nitrite use demonstrated improved remodeling both in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle. Hemodynamic effects include venodilation with reductions in right atrial pressures, pulmonary and systemic vasodilation with reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and left atrial pressures, and improved cardiac relaxation. In addition, recent clinical and nonclinical studies have demonstrated that nitrite can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion and decrease mitochondrial oxygen consumption through a mechanism distinct from that of NO, which may have utility in treating heart failure.    AIR001 Clinical Data    We obtained the AIR001 program through our acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2014. Prior to the acquisition, AIR001 had been tested in more than 120 healthy volunteers and patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension in three Phase 1 studies and in one Phase 2 study in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. While the Phase 2 study was prematurely terminated due to Aires’ capital constraints prior to the acquisition, preliminary data from the study are positive, showing improvements in hemodynamic parameters and in exercise capacity from baseline. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events and methemoglobin levels remained normal (< 1.5%), which distinguishes AIR001 from safety concerns associated with intravenously-administered nitrite. Data from these early clinical studies support continued clinical development of AIR001. Given the observed hemodynamic improvements of decreased right arterial pressure, decreased pulmonary capillary wedge (or left atrial pressure), as well as improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac lusitropic effects, AIR001 may benefit patients with exercise impairment due to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), for whom these are all desirable effects.      Potential Applications of AIR001 Hemodynamic improvements, improvements in pulmonary artery pressures, and cardiac lusitropic effects observed in earlier studies of AIR001 support AIR001’s potential to benefit patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We currently are pursuing clinical development of AIR001 for that patient population.   2013 Activities Event Timing Initiate tQT/QTc Study Completed Secure Orphan Designation for MST-188 for SCD in EU Completed Activate First Site in Phase 3 Study Completed File New Patent Applications Completed Dose First Subject in Phase 3 Study Completed Report data from tQT/QTc Study Q3 Completed and Primary Endpoints Met Request Orphan Designation for MST-188 for ALI in U.S. Q3 Completed and Designation Granted By FDA Initiate Nonclinical Proof-of-Concept Study in Heart Failure Q3 Completed and POC Data to be released Q1 '14  2014 Activities  Event Timing  Present Data From Nonclinical Proof-of-Concept Study In Heart Failure  Q1 '14  Data Released 01/06/14'Showed Significant Statistical Improvement"  Initiate Phase 2 Study in ALI Q1 '14 Initiated   Outcome of review of application for Unique Name Designation For Purified Poloxamer 188 From U.S. Adopted Names Counsel Q1 '14 Granted and Named VEPOLOXAMER  Open First Ex-U.S. Clinical Sites in Phase 3 Trial Q1 '14. Initiated and On Schedule  Submit Abstract with Heart Failure Study Biomarker Data to Major Medical Conference Q2 '14  Request Orphan Designation for ALI in EU Q2 '14  Application Submitted  Initiate Nonclinical POC Study in Stroke Q2 '14 Study Initiated  Initiate EPIC Sub-Study Q2 '14 Initiated On Schedule 06/14/14  Report Results from Phase 2 Study of AIR001 in PAH Q3 '14 Positive Top line Data released 9/8/14  Initiate study with Dept of Defense: MST-188 Resuscitation from major trauma '14 CRADA with US Military Initiated Q3 '14  Receive protocol from FDA for Phase 2 Heart Failure Study Q4'14 FDA Approves Heart Failure Study 12/9/14  2015 Event Schedule  Initiate dosing Phase2a study in AIR001 Q1 '15.  INITIATED 2/4/15  Nonclinical Study EMBOLIC STROKE Data Q1 '15:  POSITIVE DATA RELEASED 2/11/15  Report nonclinical data for repeat dose on Vepoloxamer in Heart Failure Q1 '15 POSITIVE DATA RELEASE 03/02/15  Phase 2 Study HEART FAILURE Initiate Enrollment Q2 '15 INITIATED 3/23/15  EPIC EXTENSION STUDY (Repeat Exposure) Initiate Enrollment 1st Half '15 INITIATED 5/26/15   Phase 2a Study of AIR001 (WHO GROUP 2) in HFpEF Preliminary Data 2nd Half '15  Phase 2 Study Heart Failure Interim Safety Analysis 2nd Half '15  EPIC STUDY COMPLETE ENROLLMENT Q4 '15  2016 EVENTS  EPIC Top Line Data Q1 2016          Video of Management of Mast Therapeutics $MSTX speaking about MST-188 for Sickle Cell Disease ,orphan drug  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI7inPOiyZM&feature=youtu.be  http://www.masttherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/EPIC-An-Ongoing-Pivotal-Phase-3-Study-in-Patients-with-Sickle-Cell-Disease-Aug-21-2013.      Schedule 13D and 13G filings submitted since 09/30/14      Filing Company Date of 			Filing Total Reported 			Shares Owned Shares Reported 			on 13F       Baker Bros LLC 12/31/14 4,774,434 4,774,434     BVF Inc. 3/31/15 7,241,600 7,241,600!

                Mast Therapeutics To Merge With Savara Inc. (MSTX)            


    By Shobhit Seth | January 9, 2017 — 11:20 AM EST    






Share


















































Mast Therapeutics Inc. (MSTX) is merging with privately held Savara Inc., a pharmaceutical company that develops therapies for rare respiratory diseases.
The San Diego, California-based Mast has three promising drugs in advanced stages of clinical development: AeroVanc, Molgradex and AIR001, which are expected to make a good fit for Savara’s product line.
AeroVanc and Molgradex hold orphan drug status, while Mast recently signed a pact with Royal Philips (PHG) for the AIR001 drug to be used for heart-failure patients using Philips' Adaptive Aerosol Delivery nebulizer. (For more, see Mast Therapeutics, Philips Sign Drug Pact.)
New Identity of the Merged Entity
The surviving entity will be named Savara Inc. It will be based in Austin, Texas, and will be led by Savara’s present management team. The new company’s board will have seven members, including five from Savara’s current board and two from Mast’s current board.
Savara stockholders will own around 76% of the combined entity, while Mast stockholders will own the remaining 24%. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter.
The new company will get listed on the NYSE with a new ticker symbol. To enable the deal closing, Mast will need to secure existing shareholders’ nod for executing a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares to fulfill the NYSE’s listing requirements.
Near-Term Focus
The key milestones in the near term for the combined entity will include the inception of a Phase 3 study in Q3 2017 of AeroVanc for treating chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis patients.
The merged company is awaiting the results of an ongoing European and Japanese Phase 2/3 study of Molgradex for treating pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), and plan to announce the results (during Q1 2018) from an ongoing Phase 2 study of AIR001 for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
The company will also attempt to secure nod from the U.S. Food And Drug Administration (FDA) for proceeding with a key clinical study of Molgradex during later part of 2017.
Against Friday’s closing price of $0.098 per share bringing Mast Pharmaceuticals' market cap to around $24.05 million, the company was valued at $36.5 million for the merger indicating more than 50% premium. Savara was valued at $115 million, based on its latest round of investments and an acquisition of assets of Serendex Pharmaceuticals. (For more, see Mast Therapeutics 3Q Loss Beats Street.)

(Mast, NYSE MKT: MSTX) and Savara Inc. (Savara), a privately-held emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of rare respiratory diseases, today announced that the two companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which the stockholders of Savara would become the majority owners of Mast, and the operations of Mast and Savara would be combined. Subject to stockholder approval, the combined company will advance a pipeline of novel inhalation therapies for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical needs, featuring three product candidates, each in advanced clinical development.  View photosThe combined company pipeline will include:AeroVanc, an inhaled dry-powder vancomycin to treat chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) in preparation for a pivotal Phase 3 studyMolgradex, an inhaled nebulized GM-CSF to treat pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) currently in Phase 2/3 developmentAIR001, an inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite solution to treat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) currently in Phase 2 development "Following an extensive review of strategic alternatives and a thorough process, the Mast Board of Directors chose to combine with Savara because we believe the proposed merger provides an attractive opportunity for our shareholders to obtain value appreciation from a diversified pipeline and positions the company for more rapid short- and long-term growth via a triad of late-stage clinical assets with important forthcoming milestones," stated Brian M. Culley, current Chief Executive Officer and Director of Mast Therapeutics. "We are excited for the prospects of the combined company and believe that Savara's management team is well equipped to advance the pipeline toward regulatory approvals and commercialization in the US and EU."Rob Neville, Chairman and CEO of Savara added, "This merger is transformative for Savara and marks our second transaction in a year, each expanding Savara's pipeline of inhaled therapies for serious and life-threatening diseases. AeroVanc and Molgradex are orphan-designated product candidates in late-stage development, and we see Mast's AIR001 program potentially adding significant value to our pipeline with a modest capital outlay in 2017. We believe the favorable risk profile of our product candidates combined with their market potential provides a unique opportunity for Savara to become the next breakout company in orphan pulmonary diseases."Select Anticipated Upcoming Development MilestonesInitiate a pivotal Phase 3 study of AeroVanc for the treatment of MRSA in CF patients in Q3/2017.Announce top-line results from a registration-enabling Phase 2/3 study of Molgradex for the treatment of PAP currently ongoing for Europe and Japan in Q1/2018.Complete negotiations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the requirements for a pivotal clinical study of Molgradex in the U.S. in Q3/2017.Announce results from an ongoing 100-patient Phase 2 study of AIR001 for the treatment of HFpEF being conducted by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network in Q1/2018.About the Proposed MergerUnder the terms of the merger agreement, pending stockholder approval of the transaction, Savara stockholders will receive newly issued shares of Mast common stock in exchange for their Savara stock. The exchange ratio was determined using a pre-transaction valuation of $115 million for Savara's business, based on its latest priced investment round and an acquisition of assets of Serendex Pharmaceuticals A/S, and $36.5 million for Mast's business, a premium to the 20-day volume weighted average share price of Mast. As a result, current Mast stockholders will collectively own approximately 24%, and Savara stockholders will collectively own approximately 76%, of the combined company on a pro-forma basis, subject to adjustment based on Mast's net cash balance and Mast's and Savara's capitalization at closing.The combined company, led by Savara's current management team, is expected to be named Savara Inc. and be headquartered in Austin, TX.  Prior to closing, Mast will seek stockholder approval to conduct a reverse split of its outstanding shares to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE MKT. The combined company is expected to trade on the NYSE MKT under a new ticker symbol. At closing, the combined company's board of directors is expected to consist of seven members, including five members of Savara's current board and two members of Mast's current board. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company. The transaction is expected to close by the second quarter of 2017, subject to approvals by the stockholders of Mast and Savara, and other customary closing conditions.Read MoreMast's financial advisor in the transaction is Roth Capital Partners. Canaccord Genuity Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Savara. DLA Piper LLP (US) is serving as legal counsel to Mast and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. is serving as legal counsel to Savara.Conference Call and Webcast   Mast and Savara will hold a conference call Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time / 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time to discuss the proposed transaction.  Interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (855) 239-3120 from the U.S., (855) 669-9657 from Canada, and (412) 542-4127 from outside the U.S. and should request the Mast-Savara Conference Call.

(NYSE MKT: MSTX) today provided an update related to its business strategy and the clinical development of its product candidates.The Company's cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities were $30.3 million at August 31, 2016.The Company will focus on clinical development of AIR001 (sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation) for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  Specifically, during 2016 and 2017, the Company will continue to support three ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical studies of AIR001 being conducted at prestigious research institutions.The Company has begun to wind down its vepoloxamer programs in sickle cell disease and heart failure and expects those activities will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. While furthering the development of AIR001 through the ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies, the Company is planning to initiate a process to evaluate partnership opportunities for its assets. As a result of cost savings anticipated by the termination of its vepoloxamer clinical programs and related operations and the prioritization of its AIR001 program, the Company estimates that its operating expenses for 2017 will be in the range of $9 to $10 million, excluding share-based compensation expense.  This anticipated level of spend reflects an approximate 70% reduction from estimated operating expenses for 2016 of approximately $32 to $34 million, excluding share-based compensation expense. The Company will make the $10 million prepayment on its debt facility triggered by the recently announced results of its Phase 3 study of vepoloxamer in early October 2016.  After that prepayment, the principal amount of the Company's debt will be approximately $3.5 million, which is scheduled to be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal and interest through January 1, 2019."Following a critical review of our pipeline and opportunities we have determined that a focus on AIR001 will provide for a strong foundation from which we will seek to return value to our stockholders," stated Brian M. Culley, the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  "However, these decisions likely will have a significant impact on our talented team members and I want to personally thank those who may be affected for their hard work, dedication and contributions to the vepoloxamer program."AIR001 Program Update  The Company will prioritize its AIR001 program with continued support for three separate, ongoing, investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical studies of AIR001.  Earlier this year, the Company reported positive top-line results from a blinded and randomized Phase 2a clinical study of AIR001 in HFpEF patients and detailed results were published on September 16, 2016 in Circulation Research, Volume 119, Issue 7 (available here). The Company will continue to support an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover Phase 2 study of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF being conducted by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (HFN) with support from a grant awarded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02742129)  Patient enrollment in this study is expected to complete before the end of 2017.  The majority of expenses for this 100-patient study are being funded by the HFN.The Company will continue to support an ongoing, investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical study of AIR001 in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with HFpEF. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01431313)  The Company previously reported positive interim results from the study, which results were presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference in May 2016 (poster available here).  Additional interim results from this Phase 2 study have been accepted for publication and are expected to be available in the coming weeks. The Company will continue to support an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF undergoing cardiac rehabilitation for exercise training to evaluate whether blinded treatment with AIR001 improves exercise capacity and hemodynamic reserve compared to placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02713126) Vepoloxamer Program Update  Concurrent with the wind-down of its vepoloxamer programs, which includes the termination and closure of all active clinical study sites in the EPIC extension study known as EPIC-E and the clinical pharmacokinetics study in individuals with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, the Company is in the process of analyzing additional data from the Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease known as EPIC and interim data from a Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in chronic heart failure and will assess opportunities to create value from this asset. The Company recently announced that it received a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Institute Of Neurological Disorders And Stroke of the National Institutes of Health to support investigation of vepoloxamer in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in experimental models of embolic stroke and the Company currently intends that work will continue as planned.  The Company is collaborating with leading stroke researchers at the Neuroscience Institute at Henry Ford Health System for the conduct of this preclinical study.  In addition, the Company expects that preclinical work being conducted by the U.S. military under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to evaluate vepoloxamer's potential as a resuscitation fluid following major trauma will continue. About AIR001  AIR001 is a sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation via nebulization. Nitrite is a direct vasodilator and can be recycled in vivo to form nitric oxide (NO) independent of the classical NO synthase (NOS) pathway. Nitrite mediated NO formation has several beneficial effects, including dilation of blood vessels and reduction of inflammation and undesirable cell growth. Generation of NO from sodium nitrite is not dependent upon endothelial function and is enhanced in the setting of tissue hypoxia and acidosis, conditions in which NOS activity typically is depressed. In early clinical studies, AIR001 demonstrated positive hemodynamic effects with reductions observed in right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as well as improvements in mean pulmonary artery pressures, cardiac output, and exercise tolerance as measured by six-minute walk distance. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF (n=26), the AIR001 treatment group showed a statistically significant decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise compared to the control group and AIR001 was generally well-tolerated.About Mast Therapeutics  Mast Therapeutics, Inc. is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego, California. The Company has two clinical-stage investigational new drugs, AIR001 and vepoloxamer.  AIR001, a sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation via nebulizer, is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  More information can be found on the Company's web site at www.masttherapeutics.com.  Mast Therapeutics™ and the corporate logo are trademarks of Mast Therapeutics, Inc.Read MoreForward Looking Statements  Mast Therapeutics cautions you that statements in this press release that are not a description of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words referencing future events or circumstances such as "expect," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," and "will," among others.  Examples of forward-looking statements in this press release include statements relating to the Company's development plans for its product candidates, the Company's business plans and objectives, and its anticipated operating expenses, results of operations and financial condition.  Forward-looking statements should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results because they involve the Company's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual performance and results to differ materially from expectations indicated by the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual performance or results to differ include, without limitation: the Company's need for additional funding to continue to operate as a going concern; risks associated with the Company's ability to manage operating expenses and obtain additional capital as needed; uncertainty related to the Company's ability to remain in compliance with the terms and conditions under its debt facility and risk that, in addition to the $10 million prepayment to be made in early October 2016, the Company may be required to repay its remaining outstanding debt obligations on an accelerated basis and/or at a time that could be detrimental to the Company's financial condition, operations and/or business strategy; the impact of significant reductions in the Company's operations on its ability to develop its product candidates or maintain compliance with laws and regulations relating to public companies; the Company's ability to maintain compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards and policies and to maintain the listing and trading of its common stock on that exchange; completion of a more detailed analysis of EPIC data and reporting of additional data from the study; uncertainties inherent in the conduct of clinical studies and the risk that the Company's product candidates may not demonstrate adequate safety, efficacy or tolerability in one or more clinical studies for approval by regulatory authorities; the potential for the Company to sell or license part or all of its assets; the potential for significant delays, reductions, or discontinuation of current and/or planned development activities if the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital as needed; the Company's lack of control over the ongoing, investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical studies of AIR001, including whether any of the studies will be completed on anticipated timelines, or at all; the Company's dependence on third parties to assist with important aspects of development of the Company's product candidates, including the conduct of its clinical studies, the manufacture and supply of its clinical trial material, and the conduct of regulatory activities, and the risk that such third parties may fail to perform as expected leading to delays in product candidate development and additional costs; the risk that the Company is not able to obtain and maintain effective patent coverage or other market exclusivity protections for its products, if approved, or that the use or manufacture of the Company's products may infringe the proprietary rights of others; and other risks and uncertainties more fully described in the Company's press releases and its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MSTX), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage therapies for sickle cell disease and heart failure, today reported top-line results from EPIC, a Phase 3 clinical study of its investigational new drug vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188) for the treatment of individuals with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).  The study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the mean duration of VOC (82 hours in the vepoloxamer group compared to 78 hours in the placebo group in the intent-to-treat population (p=0.09)).  There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the intent-to-treat population across the two secondary efficacy endpoints, rate of re-hospitalization for VOC and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome. Consistent with previously conducted studies, vepoloxamer was generally well tolerated with no statistically significant differences in treatment-related serious adverse events in the vepoloxamer group compared to the placebo group. No deaths occurred on the study.








"We are exceedingly disappointed with these top-line results. While clearly not the outcome we wanted, we believe the insights and data from the largest placebo-controlled clinical trial ever completed in sickle cell disease will substantially advance the understanding of vaso-occlusive crisis and the still maturing clinical science necessary to support the development of new therapeutics for this debilitating disease," stated Brian M. Culley, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. "We wish to reiterate our sincere appreciation for all of the patients, caregivers, and others who aided us in conducting this informative study."
"These analyses are limited to just top-line data, so in the coming weeks the Company intends to review the full data set from EPIC. In addition, we plan to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing heart failure trial of vepoloxamer. However, based on the data we've seen to date, we expect we will terminate all clinical development of vepoloxamer. Consequently, while we evaluate our options, we intend to significantly and immediately reduce our operating expenses and continue our efforts with AIR001, our lead asset in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which currently is the subject of a 100-patient phase 2 study expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2017," continued Mr. Culley.
Investor Conference Call The Company will hold a conference call tomorrow, September 21, 2016, at 8:00 a.m. ET / 5:00 a.m. PT to discuss the Phase 3 results.  Interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (855) 239-3120 from the U.S., (855) 669-9657 from Canada, and (412) 542-4127 from outside the U.S. and should request the Mast Therapeutics, Inc. Call.  A live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the Investors section of Mast's website at http://www.masttherapeutics.com/investors/events/. Replays of the webcast will be available on the Company's website for 30 days and a telephone replay will be available through September 28, 2016 by dialing (877) 344-7529 from the U.S., (855) 669-9658 from Canada, and (412) 317-0088 from elsewhere outside the U.S. and entering replay access code 10093117.
About the EPIC Study  The EPIC study was a randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial of vepoloxamer in individuals with sickle cell disease hospitalized for acute pain typical of vaso-occlusive crisis who required treatment with parenteral opioid analgesia. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vepoloxamer in reducing the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis, with the duration of crisis measured from the time of randomization to the time at which the patient received the last dose of parenteral opioid analgesia for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis prior to hospital discharge.  Vepoloxamer or placebo (0.45% saline) was administered intravenously as a 1 hour loading dose infusion (100 mg/kg), immediately followed by a continuous maintenance infusion (30 mg/kg/hr) for at least 12 hours and up to 48 hours.  Randomization was stratified by age (≥4 to <16 years or ≥16 to ≤65 years), use of hydroxyurea (yes or no), and pain score (measured using the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale at time of randomization: <8 or ≥8). The study was 90% powered to detect a 17% (16-hour) difference in treatment arms, with a statistical significance level of p=0.05 (assuming an average crisis duration of 96 hours in the control arm and a coefficient of variation > 50%).  Secondary efficacy endpoints were to compare the rates of re-hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis within 14 days of initial hospital discharge and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within 120 hours of randomization between the treatment and control groups.
A total of 388 patients, ages four to 46, were randomized in EPIC.  More than 75 study sites in 14 countries participated.  The average age was 15 years.  Patients under age 18 accounted for approximately 71% of total subjects.  Approximately 61% of patients were concurrently on hydroxyurea therapy.  
About Sickle Cell Disease and Vaso-Occlusive CrisisSickle cell disease is a chronic, genetic blood disorder that affects millions worldwide and an estimated 100,000 people in the United States, where it is classified as a rare, or orphan, disease.  The hallmark of sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive crisis, which results from obstruction of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells causing tissue ischemia and injury.  Vaso-occlusions can occur everywhere blood flows and lead to an accumulating disease burden in every organ system with the ultimate loss of vital organ function and significantly reduced lifespan.  Vaso-occlusive crisis is also characterized by intense and debilitating pain which can last for days and even weeks.  There are between 80,000 to 100,000 hospitalizations annually in the U.S. related to vaso-occlusive crisis and no FDA approved treatment to shorten its duration or reduce the risk of ischemic injury related to crisis.
About Mast Therapeutics Mast Therapeutics, Inc. is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego, California. The Company is developing two clinical-stage investigational new drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. Vepoloxamer, the Company's lead product candidate, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease and in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of patients with heart failure.  Enrollment in the Company's Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in patients with chronic heart failure is ongoing.  AIR001, the Company's second product candidate, is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Enrollment in Phase 2 studies of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF are ongoing, including a 100-patient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study in patients with HFpEF being conducted by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network.  More information can be found on the Company's web site at www.masttherapeutics.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
