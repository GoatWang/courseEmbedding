History[edit]




Public Service Logo






Alternate logo using more common PSE&G name, displayed on some pages on the PSEG website as of 2012


The Public Service Corporation was formed in 1903 by combining more than 400 gas, electric and transportation companies in New Jersey. It was renamed Public Service Electric and Gas Company in 1948. The transportation operations of PSE&G were purchased by New Jersey Transit in 1980, leaving PSE&G exclusively in the utility business.[4] In 1985, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) formed as a holding company, and in 1989 established Enterprise Diversified Holdings Inc. (now PSEG Energy Holdings), to begin consolidation of its unregulated businesses. In 2000, PSE&G split its unregulated national power generation assets to form PSEG Power, while PSE&G continued operating in New Jersey as a regulated gas and electric delivery company.[5]
In June 2005, the acquisition of PSEG by Exelon, a Chicago and Philadelphia based utility conglomerate, was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; however, the deal was never consummated and eventually dissolved after it became clear that it would not win state regulatory approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.[6]
In 2009, PSEG began installing solar panels on 200,000 utility poles in its service area in a project costing $773 million, the largest such project in the world.[7][8] The Solar 4 All project increased the capacity for renewable energy in New Jersey and was completed in 2013.[9] In addition, PSEG is building four solar farms in Edison, Hamilton, Linden, and Trenton.[10]

Operations[edit]




Kearny plant


PSE&G serves the population in an area consisting of a 2,600-square-mile (6,700 km2) diagonal corridor across the state from Bergen to Gloucester Counties.[15][16] PSE&G is the largest provider of gas and electric service, servicing 1.8 million gas customers and 2.2 million electric customers in more than 300 urban, suburban and rural communities, including New Jersey's six largest cities.
PSEG Nuclear operates three nuclear reactors at two facilities in Lower Alloways Creek Township. PSEG owns one reactor at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station and operates two reactors at Salem Nuclear Power Plant where PSEG Nuclear holds a 57 percent stake (in partnership with Exelon Corporation). Exelon also operates two reactors at Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station in a 50/50 joint venture with PSEG.[17]
PSEG Long Island provides electricity to 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula of Queens, part of New York City.[18] This system operates under an agreement with the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that owns the system, that went into effect January 1, 2014.[19] PSEG was selected to essentially privatize LIPA, taking over near complete control of the system including its brand name, whereas before this agreement only a number of functions were performed by the private sector and the system was operated under the LIPA name.
System information[edit]
PSEG's transmission line voltages are 500,000 volts, 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts and 138,000 volts with interconnections to utilities in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York. The company's subtransmission voltages are 69,000 volts and 26,000 volts. PSEG's distribution voltages are 13,000 volts and 4,160 volts.
Environmental record[edit]
In 2001, PSEG received The Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards in Coastal and Ocean Resource Management[20] in the category of Excellence in Business Leadership for its Estuary Enhancement Program.[21]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified PSEG as the 48th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly five million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[22] Major pollutants indicated by the study include manganese, chromium and nickel salts; sulfuric and hydrochloric acid.[23]

History[edit]

Alternate logo using more common PSE&G name, displayed on some pages on the PSEG website as of 2012


The Public Service Corporation was formed in 1903 by combining more than 400 gas, electric and transportation companies in New Jersey. It was renamed Public Service Electric and Gas Company in 1948. The transportation operations of PSE&G were purchased by New Jersey Transit in 1980, leaving PSE&G exclusively in the utility business.[4] In 1985, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) formed as a holding company, and in 1989 established Enterprise Diversified Holdings Inc. (now PSEG Energy Holdings), to begin consolidation of its unregulated businesses. In 2000, PSE&G split its unregulated national power generation assets to form PSEG Power, while PSE&G continued operating in New Jersey as a regulated gas and electric delivery company.[5]
In June 2005, the acquisition of PSEG by Exelon, a Chicago and Philadelphia based utility conglomerate, was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; however, the deal was never consummated and eventually dissolved after it became clear that it would not win state regulatory approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.[6]
In 2009, PSEG began installing solar panels on 200,000 utility poles in its service area in a project costing $773 million, the largest such project in the world.[7][8] The Solar 4 All project increased the capacity for renewable energy in New Jersey and was completed in 2013.[9] In addition, PSEG is building four solar farms in Edison, Hamilton, Linden, and Trenton.[10]

Operations[edit]




Kearny plant


PSE&G serves the population in an area consisting of a 2,600-square-mile (6,700 km2) diagonal corridor across the state from Bergen to Gloucester Counties.[15][16] PSE&G is the largest provider of gas and electric service, servicing 1.8 million gas customers and 2.2 million electric customers in more than 300 urban, suburban and rural communities, including New Jersey's six largest cities.
PSEG Nuclear operates three nuclear reactors at two facilities in Lower Alloways Creek Township. PSEG owns one reactor at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station and operates two reactors at Salem Nuclear Power Plant where PSEG Nuclear holds a 57 percent stake (in partnership with Exelon Corporation). Exelon also operates two reactors at Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station in a 50/50 joint venture with PSEG.[17]
PSEG Long Island provides electricity to 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula of Queens, part of New York City.[18] This system operates under an agreement with the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that owns the system, that went into effect January 1, 2014.[19] PSEG was selected to essentially privatize LIPA, taking over near complete control of the system including its brand name, whereas before this agreement only a number of functions were performed by the private sector and the system was operated under the LIPA name.
System information[edit]
PSEG's transmission line voltages are 500,000 volts, 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts and 138,000 volts with interconnections to utilities in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York. The company's subtransmission voltages are 69,000 volts and 26,000 volts. PSEG's distribution voltages are 13,000 volts and 4,160 volts.
Environmental record[edit]
In 2001, PSEG received The Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards in Coastal and Ocean Resource Management[20] in the category of Excellence in Business Leadership for its Estuary Enhancement Program.[21]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified PSEG as the 48th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly five million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[22] Major pollutants indicated by the study include manganese, chromium and nickel salts; sulfuric and hydrochloric acid.[23]

History[edit]

The Public Service Corporation was formed in 1903 by combining more than 400 gas, electric and transportation companies in New Jersey. It was renamed Public Service Electric and Gas Company in 1948. The transportation operations of PSE&G were purchased by New Jersey Transit in 1980, leaving PSE&G exclusively in the utility business.[4] In 1985, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) formed as a holding company, and in 1989 established Enterprise Diversified Holdings Inc. (now PSEG Energy Holdings), to begin consolidation of its unregulated businesses. In 2000, PSE&G split its unregulated national power generation assets to form PSEG Power, while PSE&G continued operating in New Jersey as a regulated gas and electric delivery company.[5]
In June 2005, the acquisition of PSEG by Exelon, a Chicago and Philadelphia based utility conglomerate, was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; however, the deal was never consummated and eventually dissolved after it became clear that it would not win state regulatory approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.[6]
In 2009, PSEG began installing solar panels on 200,000 utility poles in its service area in a project costing $773 million, the largest such project in the world.[7][8] The Solar 4 All project increased the capacity for renewable energy in New Jersey and was completed in 2013.[9] In addition, PSEG is building four solar farms in Edison, Hamilton, Linden, and Trenton.[10]

Operations[edit]




Kearny plant


PSE&G serves the population in an area consisting of a 2,600-square-mile (6,700 km2) diagonal corridor across the state from Bergen to Gloucester Counties.[15][16] PSE&G is the largest provider of gas and electric service, servicing 1.8 million gas customers and 2.2 million electric customers in more than 300 urban, suburban and rural communities, including New Jersey's six largest cities.
PSEG Nuclear operates three nuclear reactors at two facilities in Lower Alloways Creek Township. PSEG owns one reactor at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station and operates two reactors at Salem Nuclear Power Plant where PSEG Nuclear holds a 57 percent stake (in partnership with Exelon Corporation). Exelon also operates two reactors at Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station in a 50/50 joint venture with PSEG.[17]
PSEG Long Island provides electricity to 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula of Queens, part of New York City.[18] This system operates under an agreement with the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that owns the system, that went into effect January 1, 2014.[19] PSEG was selected to essentially privatize LIPA, taking over near complete control of the system including its brand name, whereas before this agreement only a number of functions were performed by the private sector and the system was operated under the LIPA name.
System information[edit]
PSEG's transmission line voltages are 500,000 volts, 345,000 volts, 230,000 volts and 138,000 volts with interconnections to utilities in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York. The company's subtransmission voltages are 69,000 volts and 26,000 volts. PSEG's distribution voltages are 13,000 volts and 4,160 volts.
Environmental record[edit]
In 2001, PSEG received The Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards in Coastal and Ocean Resource Management[20] in the category of Excellence in Business Leadership for its Estuary Enhancement Program.[21]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified PSEG as the 48th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly five million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[22] Major pollutants indicated by the study include manganese, chromium and nickel salts; sulfuric and hydrochloric acid.[23]

Short Interest Decreases By 11.4% For PEG
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 02/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,031,750 share decrease in total short interest for Public Service Enterprise Group Inc , to 7,988,900, a decrease of 11.44% since 01/31/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

The New #107 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component: Public Service Enterprise Group
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 01/31/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

Ex-Dividend Reminder: Public Service Enterprise Group, Westar Energy and Avangrid

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , on 6/7/17, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (Symbol: PEG), Westar Energy Inc (Symbol: WR), and Avangrid Inc (Symbol: AGR) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Public Service Enterprise Group Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.43 on 6/30/17, Westar Energy Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.40 on 7/3/17, and Avangrid Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.432 on 7/3/17. As a percentage of PEG's recent stock price of $44.98, this dividend works out to approximately 0.96%, so look for shares of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc to trade 0.96% lower - all else being equal - when PEG shares open for trading on 6/7/17. Similarly, investors should look for WR to open 0.75% lower in price and for AGR to open 0.95% lower, all else being equal.    Below are dividend history charts for PEG, WR, and AGR, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.   Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (Symbol: PEG)  :       Westar Energy Inc (Symbol: WR)  :         Avangrid Inc (Symbol: AGR)  :          In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 3.82% for Public Service Enterprise Group Inc, 3.01% for Westar Energy Inc, and 3.79% for Avangrid Inc.    In Monday trading, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc shares are currently off about 0.4%, Westar Energy Inc shares are trading flat, and Avangrid Inc shares are down about 0.3% on the day.
