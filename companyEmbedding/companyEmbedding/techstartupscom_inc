Cryptocurrency





Dear Floyd Mayweather, you’re why the SEC exists


					4 hours ago				
				 
					by John Mannes 
Dear Floyd Mayweather: While perusing Facebook, I chanced across your post drumming up interest in the upcoming Stox initial coin offering (ICO). I understand your motivations in wanting to diversify your portfolio of investments, but I caution that your actions are reckless and potentially financially damaging to you and your fans.

Gas pump card skimmer now phones home


					4 hours ago				
				 
					by John Biggs 
In an unsurprising move by credit card thieves, police have found a new credit card skimmer that sends stolen data via SMS. By tearing apart cheap phones, crooks are able to send credit card information to their location instantly without having to access the skimmer physically or rely on an open Bluetooth connection.
Brian Krebs received images of the skimmer from an unnamed source. They… Read More

Foxconn’s long con

5 hours ago by John Biggs 
The political press ate it up, alternatively excoriating the program for costing too much in tax breaks and crowing a win for Wisconsin’s conservative governor, Scott Walker.
I wouldn’t encourage either party to hold their breath.
Gou is in the habit of promising big and rarely delivering. Four years ago business journals crowed about a plan to bring a Foxconn flat screen… Read More

Life Bot’s new Alexa app can text you reminders, help with daily activities


					6 hours ago				
				 
					by Sarah Perez 
A new voice app from Life Bot wants to make it easier to use Amazon Alexa as a digital assistant, by aiding with your daily routines and learning your personal preferences. At launch, Life Bot’s Alexa app has a handful of tricks up its sleeve. But Life Bot’s longer-term ambition is to learn from its users, then be able to kick-off personalized workflows with a single voice command. Read More















Advertising Tech





Placecast launches new product to verify the location data in mobile ad campaigns


					6 hours ago				
				 
					by Anthony Ha 
Alistair Goodman, CEO of mobile marketing company Placecast, said location data is the “next frontier” when it comes to ad measurement and verification.
For example, Goodman pointed to a study by Factual and the Mobile Marketing Association that found that 40 percent of marketers are concerned about the quality of location data. He said there are a number of different… Read More

Stitch Fix has confidentially filed for an IPO


					7 hours ago				
				 
					by Matthew Lynley, Katie Roof 
Stitch Fix has filed confidentially for an initial public offering, setting itself up for another big test for the IPO market in the near future. This marks the beginning of the official beginning of the process ahead of the S-1 filing where the company will formally disclose its financials. Read More















Startups





CocuSocial is a marketplace for affordable cooking classes


					7 hours ago				
				 
					by Fitz Tepper 
CocuSocial was founded on a simple premise: traditional cooking classes, while fun, are usually way too expensive and intensive.
This means that many potential customers may be scared away by thinking they can’t afford a cooking class or it’s going to be geared towards participants with a higher skill set. And this is partially true – classes at places like Sur la Table can… Read More

Eero acqui-hires smart home management startup Thington


					9 hours ago				
				 
					by Ryan Lawler 
Mesh Wi-Fi router company Eero wants to provide an easy way for consumers to connect and connect with all the smart devices in their home. As it looks to build more intelligence around how those devices interact, the company has acqui-hired the team behind smart home management app Thington. Read More

HotelFlex lets you check in and out of a hotel at whatever time you want


					11 hours ago				
				 
					by Fitz Tepper 
Most would agree that the worst part of traveling is timing the hotel check in. Either you get off a redeye and have to figure out what to do all day while waiting to check in, or you arrive late at night and waste money paying for a room you didn’t get to use all day.
Enter HotelFlex. Part of Y Combinator’s summer 2017 batch, the startup wants to change the way hotels operate… Read More

Mattress startup Purple merges with NY shell company in $1.1 billion deal


					22 hours ago				
				 
					by Sarah Buhr 
Purple, a Utah-based mattress startup, announced today it will merge with Global Partner Acquisition Corp (GPAC) in a deal that would value the company at $1.1 billion. The new deal is known as a “reverse merger” and would result in Purple becoming a publicly traded company overnight, but without the formal IPO process. Read More

Dropbox is reportedly inching closer to a potential IPO


					yesterday				
				 
					by Matthew Lynley 
Dropbox may be taking another step in its very slow shuffle toward an IPO, and is now working with Goldman Sachs to prepare documents that could be filed as soon as this year, according to a report by Bloomberg. The company is expected to hire Goldman Sachs as the lead advisor of the IPO process, according to the report. Read More

Timekettle’s WT2 real-time translation earpieces enable ordinary conversation across language barriers


					yesterday				
				 
					by Devin Coldewey 









At TechCrunch’s event in Shenzhen last month, we had a chance to test out the WT2, a clever and ambitious device from startup TimeKettle. It’s a pair of wireless earpieces; each person in a multilingual conversation wears one, and they translate what’s said into the language spoken by each participant. Essentially it’s a Babel fish, though admittedly a rough draft of one. Read More

Patook wants to be Tinder for platonic friendships


					yesterday				
				 
					by Natasha Lomas 
Technology isn’t necessarily the best solution for forging new real life connections, whatever the collective marketing spiel of the web’s social giants likes to claim. But Patook is having a crack at the tricky feat of remotely sparking friendships, without inviting in the creeps… Read More

Net30 wants to fix the construction industry’s payments problem


					yesterday				
				 
					by Catherine Shu 
The invoicing and payments process in the commercial construction industry is broken. It takes a median of about 70 days to get paid, which means contractors are often stuck without enough working capital. Net30, a startup in Y Combinator’s current batch, wants to solve that problem.

UpCodes makes researching building regulations less exhausting for architects


					yesterday				
				 
					by Catherine Shu 
For architects, complying with building codes means navigating labyrinthine layers of regulations that vary between municipalities. Sorting through different codes and keeping track of updates is a daunting task and, in a worst-case scenario, a mistake can cost thousands or even millions of dollars to tear out and fix. Firms that can afford it hire building code consultants, but a startup… Read More

Peer5 raises $2.5M for its peer-to-peer approach to streaming video


					yesterday				
				 
					by Anthony Ha 
Peer5, which helps publishers stream video to large audiences, is announcing that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding.
I wrote about the startup earlier this year when it was part of Y Combinator. CEO Hadar Weiss said he raised the funding after YC Demo Day from investors including FundersClub, Oriza Ventures, Tank Hill Ventures, Leorsa Group, Ed Roman and Buddy Anheim.
In… Read More

Devialet announces surround sound TV speaker with Sky


					yesterday				
				 
					by Romain Dillet 
French speaker maker Devialet just announced a brand new speaker in partnership with British broadcasting company Sky. The Sky Soundbox is a single speaker designed for your TV. It’s roughly the size of a gaming console and it is supposed to produce surround-like sound.
This partnership is something brand new for the French startup. Most people know Devialet for its expensive… Read More

Cool Cousin’s social app for travellers raises $2M round, led by Elevator Fund


					yesterday				
				 
					by Mike Butcher 
Imagine if you could go to the profile of a friend of Foursquare and instead of scrolling through the long list of coffee shops they’d checked into in Berlin, you could simply click a button and add all their recommendations to your personal map in one go. That’s essentially the offering of Cool Cousin, an app and web site which is mining one of the last bastions of social media… Read More

Brolly, an ‘AI-driven’ insurance app, raises £1M seed round led by Valar Ventures and Pi Labs


					yesterday				
				 
					by Steve O'Hear 
Brolly, a U.K. ‘insurtech’ startup that offers an app to help you manage and purchase various insurance products, has raised £1 million in seed funding. Valar Ventures, the U.S.-based venture fund backed by Peter Thiel, led the round, with Pi Labs co-leading. Entrepreneur First (EF) also participated via the company builder’s £40 million “Next Stage Fund”. Read More

A running list of every company backed by the $93B SoftBank Vision Fund


					Jul 26, 2017				
				 
					by John Mannes 
When SoftBank announced the first close of its $93 billion Vision Fund back in May, it was hard to understand how the company would even manage to deploy so much capital in an already saturated ecosystem. For starters, it seemed like a good idea to keep a running list of all Vision Fund investments for reference. We will update this list on a regular basis. Read More

Tech Start-ups to Watch in 2011


Even online stalwarts like Amazon.com and eBay started out as start-ups once upon a time. Check out how these entrepreneurs are using technology to try to make their brands household names in 2011.

Light bulb moments happen frequently in the tech world. You might be driving home from a day job and think: what if I created a social network for dog owners? Or how could I capitalize on the iPhone's popularity and build my own app?
Unlike some other industries, costs for starting a tech company can inflate quickly -- for Web hosting, servers, and hiring a staff. Yet, these brand new tech start-ups took a brilliant idea and turned it into a fledgling company that is ready to take on the world. Here's how each business owner started their company, how the technology works, and their projections for success.
ThredUP
ThredUP started in October 2009 as the brainchild of James Reinhart (his official bio says he is the "Chief Knitwit"). Initially, the site allowed you to send in a shirt you didn't want anymore and receive a shirt in the mail at a low cost -- almost like a NetFlix for clothes. Reinhart says, around the time he and his wife were expecting their first child, he kept hearing from customers who wanted a service for swapping out kid's clothing. The site re-focused and revamped, then re-launched in April 2009. The idea is that you first pick a box of used clothing in the size your child needs and pay $5 plus shipping. Then, you pack up about 15 clothing items (ThredUP provides the box for free) and send that in. When someone else orders your box, you receive the clothes you picked initially. Reinhart says the company is considering a swap system for maternity clothes and just added discussion forum feature.
Thuuz.com
"Edge-of-your-seat" moments in sports are rare -- few football matches end in a nail-biter, and some college basketball games are total routs. Since most of us are too busy to watch these games live, and the latest DVRs can record hundreds of shows, it's easier to just record and forget them. Yet, knowing which games are worth watching and deliver the thrills is often difficult. Warren Packard realized this while watching a dull Chicago Bears game last fall, one that ended in a 10-6 defeat. During the game, he decided to figure out a way to cull only the best moments in recent sporting events, then post the details about the game online. For example, one posting instructs site visitors to watch only the last five minutes of an Georgia Bulldogs college game. His site, called Thuuz.com,uses an algorithm he invented that tracks up to 200 statistics in a game, such as long passes and touchdown runs. The site does not show any video clips or scores, but lists the portion of the game that is the most exciting with an overall rating about its entertainment value. This year, they plan it include soccer and NHL games.
Chocri
Sometimes, love can make you do some crazy things. It can also lead to some brilliant entrepreneurial ideas. About two years ago, German entrepreneur Franz Duge was selling chocolate fountains on eBay to make extra money as a college student. At the time, he couldn't find the right gift for his girlfriend, so he devised a way to order a chocolate bar made with custom ingredients and toppings. At the site, you can choose from four base chocolates and from 100 different toppings like basil and strawberry. Carmen Magar, who is the CEO for the US version of Chocri, says the company can produce as many as 50,000 custom bars per month -- and they are all handmade. She says one of the challenges they have is in scaling the company. "In order to scale up, we just received an investment from Ritter, which bought a third of our shares for a low seven digit figure. We are investing that in our production to automate more elements of the process to be able to scale more," says Magar.
Twisplays
Chris Anderson, the author of the book Free and Wired's editor-in-chief, says we're in a transition from physical atoms to digital bits. Don't tell that to Joshua Persky. The former NYC banker kept getting light bulb moments about an LED display that shows Twitter feeds. These 140-character messages can include weather info, status updates, sports scores, or anything you can find on Twitter. Persky had a banking client who created plasma TV advertising for a local bar. He is an MIT graduate so he already gets the technology, including networking aspects and costs. He also heard about another business that uses LED signs on vending machines and had seen Twitter feeds on massive signs in Times Square. He built a prototype Twisplay and friends on LinkedIn.com said they loved the idea. Persky said he had orders waiting before the product was even ready for launch. The displays measure 26"x4"x1.5" so they are small enough to sit in the back of a conference room or in your cubicle. To use them, you connect the display to your laptop, which provides the Internet connection. (Some models connect to a cell phone network.) "My business plan is to sell 1,000 signs by November 2011, putting Twisplays' revenues at $300,000 to $500,000. We just sold three customized ten-foot Twisplays to a social media restaurant in NYC and are in negotiations with a large telecom for a 100-site college campus network," says Persky.

There's never been a better time to launch a startup. With so many innovative tools in the marketplace, it's possible for even the smallest startup to gain access to big time resources. From marketing to sales to project management, there's a product or service for virtually any need.1. Slack (for Internal Communication)If you've never tried Slack, the wildly popular team collaboration app, then you're missing out. Slack is an intuitive app that lets teams collaborate and share without the delays and complications that are often associated with other forms of communication.Slack reduces internal email, consolidates communication into a single place, and makes it much easier to control remote or fragmented teams. All of this leads to increased productivity and engagement.2. Moz (for SEO and Analytics)For startups, there's always a lot of initial pressure to establish a strong SEO foundation. Typically this results in one of two decisions: (1) hire an outside SEO and pay a pretty penny, or (2) manually handle everything yourself and extend your workday by a few hours. Neither option sounds great, so many forget all about SEO. Unfortunately, this isn't the right choice, either.That's where Moz comes into play. Moz products decipher valuable data so that you can reach your full online potential. With products designed for search marketing, content marketing, and analytics, you can amplify your efforts and spend less time doing it.3. Optimizely (for Split Testing and Optimization)Part of the challenge of being a startup is that you aren't always completely certain what your target market wants (or even who your target market is). In terms of web design and development, this can leave you with lots of question marks. Optimizely helps you find some clarity through A/B testing and real-time analytics. It's the quickest way to hone in on what works.4. Google Analytics (for Website Analytics)Few tools are as powerful or necessary as Google Analytics. From tracking web traffic goals to optimizing user experiences, this powerful analytics platform gives you access to thousands of unique data points. And the best thing about it is the price tag: free!5. botkeeper (for Bookkeeping and Accounting)Your startup needs accurate financials and reporting to measure performance and make business decisions.  But doing it yourself or hiring a bookkeeper/outsourced firm costs time and money that you don't have.botkeeper allows you to automate your bookkeeping and includes a CPA for advice, quality control, and any of the custom nuances or questions that might come up. Pay your bills, invoice your customers, track expenses, perform reconciliations, and generate reports in the dashboard without having to lift a finger.6. Evernote (for Project Management)Evernote is a do-it-all app that can be used by your entire startup team to streamline productivity and enhance project management. There are thousands of different ways to use Evernote, but it's most commonly used for brainstorming ideas, taking notes, getting feedback, and sharing files. There are both free and paid options.8. Zenefits (for HR and Payroll)As your startup grows, HR will become increasingly important. With Zenefits, you can access everything online for better automation. Features include payroll, benefits, time and attendance tracking, compliance, management, and talent onboarding and recruiting. It's one of the easiest ways to consolidate your HR into a single platform. The best part about Zenefits is that it's totally free. They get paid by benefits providers, which means it's free for startups and businesses to use.8. Square (for Accepting Payments)If you sell physical products, Square is the service for you. While Square is perhaps best known for the small magstripe readers that can be attached to mobile devices to process transactions, it's also a full-service credit card processing solution for businesses. With square, you can accept virtually any payment from anywhere. It's great for startups that sell products online, in-store, and on the go.9. Buffer (for Social Media)Managing social media is a full-time job...unless you have Buffer. With Buffer, you can manage all of your social media accounts from a single platform. It lets you schedule content, post to multiple accounts at once, and even create powerful multimedia elements that boost engagement. Plans range from free for individuals to $399 for large agencies.10. RescueTime (for Productivity and Time Management)Find yourself getting distracted frequently throughout the day? Not sure how well you're spreading out your time across multiple tasks? RescueTime is here to help. This simple time management software helps you eliminate distractions and tracks the time you spend on certain applications and websites. As a result, you're better able to shape your daily schedule moving forward. There's a free version that lets you experience the basic functions, as well as a premium version for extended use.Arm Your Startup With the Right ToolsIn order to thrive in today's market, you need to arm your startup with the right products and services. When considering any product or service, make sure you're doing your due diligence, reading reviews, and studying the details. As a young startup, it's imperative that you take a cautious approach to aligning your business with any third party resource. Just as the right tool can help you move forward, the wrong one can set you back.With tools like these, you can quickly rise above the competition and scale your company into the business you want it to become. Keep these in mind as you carefully evaluate the needs of your business.

Call it a failure post-mortem. Nine out of 10 startups fail, which is why the failure post-mortem has become so common that it's practically a Silicon Valley cliché. Some of these essays are honest, enlightening, and brave. Others point fingers or issue backward non-apologies. Medium, the publishing platform, is the preferred medium.The proliferation of the failure post-mortem has helped create a bizarre cult of failure that seems wrong-headed. Celebrating failure (“Fail fast” goes the mantra) seems to let people off the hook for bad behavior. Upon closer inspection, it seems less misguided than necessary. Starting a high-growth business is a roller coaster. Founder-CEOs feel pressure to keep up the facade of success, even when things are actually falling apart behind the scenes. Only recently, after the tragic suicide of Jody Sherman, CEO of a startup called Ecomom, did the technology community begin to publicly acknowledge the problems with its “entrepreneur as hero” narrative. Publicly admitting to failure, and examining it, can take guts. It also distills the narrative to a case study from which other entrepreneurs can learn.CB Insights recently parsed 101 post-mortem essays by startup founders to pinpoint the reasons they believe their company failed. On Thursday the company crunched the numbers to reveal that the number-one reason for failure, cited by 42% of polled startups, is the lack of a market need for their product.That should be self-evident. If no one wants your product, your company isn’t going to succeed. But many startups build things people don’t want with the irrational hope that they'll convince them otherwise.The most prominent modern example of this phenomenon is the mobile phone. People dismissed it as a novelty in its early days. Obviously, cell phones are no longer a novelty. The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs famously said, “A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.” The problem is that entrepreneurs have taken that to heart. For every $19 billion company like Uber, the private transportation service, there are countless frivolous products that never catch on.Beyond the idea, there are more practical reasons startups fail. Polled founders also cited a lack of sufficient capital (29%), the assembly of the wrong team for the project (23%), and superior competition (19%) as top reasons for failure.The self-assessment lines up, for the most part, with what industry experts have said. Paul Graham, a partner at the Y Combinator startup accelerator, wrote in 2007 that startups usually die because they run out of money or a founder leaves.Steve Hogan, who runs a startup turn-around shop called Tech-Rx, says companies with founded by one person—that is, no partners—are most likely to fail. He ranks product demand, or a lack thereof, second. The existence of a co-founder helps avoid many of the reasons cited at the bottom of the CB Insights chart, he says, including disharmony, poor marketing, and the wrong team.Running out of cash does not cause a startup's failure, Hogan says—it's merely a symptom of another issue. Excluding instances of “stupid spending” or the inability to raise capital in the first place, startups tend to run out of cash when a CEO has overlooked all other indicators of failure. “Unfortunately, sometimes it's the only ‘symptom’ that the leadership sees,” he says.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
