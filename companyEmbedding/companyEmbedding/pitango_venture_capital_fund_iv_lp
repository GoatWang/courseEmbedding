Registration country: IsraelISIC Code: 6630Company type: Venture capital firm
Overview: Pitango Venture Capital began investing in Israeli entrepreneurs in 1993 under the name Polaris. The first fund was managed by Rami Kalish. In 1996, Rami Kalish teamed up with Chemi Peres, who was the managing director of the Mofet Israel Technology Fund, in order to raise Pitango Fund II. The second investment fund raised $125 million, the first Israel-originated fund to raise more than $100 million. Pitango's Fund II invested in 35 high tech companies-several of which were jointly funded by Eucalyptus Ventures. As a result of that successful co-investing relationship, the managing partners of the two firms merged, and began raising capital for a third independent fund. In early 2000, Fund III closed at $500 million, bringing the funds managed by Pitango to over $700 million. In 2004, the Pitango team successfully raised Pitango Venture Capital Fund IV, with committed capital in the amount of $300 million, bring the total funds managed by Pitango to over $1 billion.

History[edit]
The fund was founded as Polaris Venture Capital in 1993 by Rami Kalish, as part of a government initiative named the Yozma program ("Initiative" in Hebrew); which offered attractive tax incentives to any foreign venture-capital investments in Israel and offered to double any investment with funds from the government.[2]
In 1996, Kalish was joined by Chemi Peres, son of Israel former president Shimon Peres, to create Polaris Fund II, which raised more than $100 million, Polaris II invested in 35 high-tech companies. Some were partially funded by another Israeli VC firm, Eucalyptus Ventures. When the investments proved successful, Polaris II and Eucalyptus merged into Fund III in early 2000.[1]
In 2001, Polaris Venture Capital changed its name to Pitango Venture Capital, to avoid confusion with Boston based Polaris Venture Partners (even though the Boston firm was founded after Pitango in 1996, the Israeli firm chose to change its name). Pitango takes its name from the semi-wild Surinam Cherry that grows in Israel.[3]
Pitango Venture Capital Fund IV followed in 2004, and in 2007, Pitango V.
In 2010, with the support of the Israeli government, Pitango established the first fund in the country focused on investment in the Arab-Israeli sector, called Al-Bawader (Arabic for “early signs”).[4]

History[edit]
The fund was founded as Polaris Venture Capital in 1993 by Rami Kalish, as part of a government initiative named the Yozma program ("Initiative" in Hebrew); which offered attractive tax incentives to any foreign venture-capital investments in Israel and offered to double any investment with funds from the government.[2]
In 1996, Kalish was joined by Chemi Peres, son of Israel former president Shimon Peres, to create Polaris Fund II, which raised more than $100 million, Polaris II invested in 35 high-tech companies. Some were partially funded by another Israeli VC firm, Eucalyptus Ventures. When the investments proved successful, Polaris II and Eucalyptus merged into Fund III in early 2000.[1]
In 2001, Polaris Venture Capital changed its name to Pitango Venture Capital, to avoid confusion with Boston based Polaris Venture Partners (even though the Boston firm was founded after Pitango in 1996, the Israeli firm chose to change its name). Pitango takes its name from the semi-wild Surinam Cherry that grows in Israel.[3]
Pitango Venture Capital Fund IV followed in 2004, and in 2007, Pitango V.
In 2010, with the support of the Israeli government, Pitango established the first fund in the country focused on investment in the Arab-Israeli sector, called Al-Bawader (Arabic for “early signs”).[4]
