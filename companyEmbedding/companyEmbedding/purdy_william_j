Federal and state regulators have known about these practices for years. However, Lender/servicers have had a de-facto exemption from enforcement.BurglaryDocuments at the Santa Cruz County Recorder's Office show three such loans were made to Watsonville residents, one to a Freedom resident, one to an Aptos resident and four to Santa Cruz residents. The loans range from $230,000 to $510,000. Similar loans were made to residents of Monterey, San Joaquin, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, Atkinson said. Atkinson filed a criminal complaint against Shaikh on Wednesday accusing him of 10 counts of first-degree burglary for entering people's homes with the intent to steal money from them. Shaikh was arrested at his Fremont home Thursday. Atkinson expected that each of the 129 records in Shaikh's books represented another illegal loan.Murder4.

If you think you’re smarter than they are, that may be so, but they have the power to sell your house while you’re pointing to your advanced degrees on the wall. If you think the system will “naturally” vindicate you, you are wrong. State and federal courts have given shameful obsequious, fawning deference to lenders for years. This has allowed the financial murder of millions of Americans to occur while the courts looked on with righteous indignation. (This judicial attitude has changed only slightly and only recently.)ForgeryHundreds of thousands of years of criminal mail, fraud wire fraud, conspiracy, forgery, perjury, subornation of perjury, obstruction of justice and RICO violations committed by high level executives.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
