Customer Questions & Answers








            If generac generator is 30 amp and house is 20 amp can I use this cord
        


Asked by: Perplexed

            This cord is not designed to connect the generator directly to your home's power supply. To avoid damage to your home and potential injury, a manual transfer switch must be installed if you would like to use a portable generator to power loads within your home. To ensure you are utilizing the appropriate products for your desired configuration, we would recommend working with a certified electrician in your local area. For help locating a certified electrician near you, contact us directly at 888-GENERAC (436-3722).

            can I use a 10 foot cord and a 25 foot cord to reach my destination safely
        

            can I use a 10 foot cord and a 25 foot cord to reach my destination safely
        
Asked by: slim

            Yes you can. However keep in mind that as you are increasing the cord length you are also increasing the overall Ohmic resistance of the cord. Consequently you may, depending on the overall length, experience power loss in the form of a voltage drop. Do ensure that both cords meet or exceed the minimum conductor gauge requirement dictated by the maximum available circuit current draw. Failure to due so could result in an overheating cord and the subsequent risk electrical fire.

            I have a B&amp;S 5500watt generator with 8500watt starting. Can I use this cord?
        
Asked by: Josh

            As we design our product's and accessories for use with our own products, we are unable to confirm the compatibility of this cord with a portable generator produced by an alternative manufacturer.
