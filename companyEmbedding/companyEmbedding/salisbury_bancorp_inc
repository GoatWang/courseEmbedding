You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

Salisbury Bancorp, Inc. And Riverside Bank Announce A Strategic Merger






GlobeNewswire



Mar 19, 2014 9:11 AM EDT













 


















































  Mr. Cantele concluded, "We look forward to partnering with Riverside to create a bank with greater scale, product breadth and efficiency to compete more effectively and deliver strong returns to our shareholders. We are excited about the future of our combined company."   John M. Davies, President and Chief Executive Officer of Riverside, echoed those sentiments by saying, "Given our compatible cultures with similar community orientation, customer focus and our ability to meaningfully contribute to the combined company, Salisbury was the clear choice as Riverside's partner. This merger creates value for the customers, employees and shareholders of both banks, and will strengthen our ability to support the communities in which we operate."   Mr. Davies went on to state, "By partnering with Salisbury, our customers will have an expanded range of financial products, provided by a team with a common focus on superior service. Further, our stakeholders will benefit from the presence of a strong, soundly managed bank committed to serving businesses and individuals across our markets. We are excited about this partnership and believe our combined growth prospects leave us well positioned in the marketplace."    Upon completion of the transaction, Mr. Davies will serve as the President of Salisbury Bank's New York Region. Further, Charles M. Andola, George Banta, Michael D. Gordon, Polly Diane Hoe and Rudolph P. Russo will join Salisbury's Board.  Riverside's executive officers, Riverside's nominees to the Salisbury Board of Directors and the other members of Riverside's Board of Directors, have signed an agreement to vote their shares in favor of the merger. In the aggregate, such voting agreements represent approximately 52.3% of the outstanding Riverside Stock.  The transaction is subject to approval by the shareholders of Salisbury and Riverside, as well as customary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth calendar quarter of 2014.

This Stock Has A 3.98% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, And Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
