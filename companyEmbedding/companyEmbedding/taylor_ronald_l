My wife and I were refused a refund on a defective phone that was purchased at the Kroger Shopping Center located at Winchester Road & Hacks Cross. We were refused a refund for the defective product (that was returned well within the allotted fourteen day refund period) told that we would not be, and I quote, "dealt with" by the store's manager, a Mr. Dustin Doyle because, and I quote again, "the receipt is a reprint", and escorted from the store by the store's security guard. It was almost the single most embarrassing moment of my entire life until the real, shocker came only moments after we left the store area, via voice call to the Krogers Corporate Office. We were told by a Krogers Ambassador/Representative that he had not only neglected to mention the so-called "reprinted receipt" which he originally claimed was the sole reason that was so hell bent on not "dealing with us", particularly myself, but he went as far as to degrade us to the lowest of terms by stating that he chose not to deal with us because he felt that it was "fraudulent activity". Fraudulent activity?! It was a thirty dollar Trac Phone for God sake. A Trac Phone, man. I am not one to pull the race but that was the last straw. Lord knows it was. This incident goes far beyond any embarrassment that I, myself personally have ever suffered. My wife hasn't stopped crying, yet. Someone's going to pay. That simple. Thank you. God bless. Todd, Michael Sean LCSWLletitia L. ratedI am most grateful for Sean Todd who has taken on one of the most .challenging positions of .concerns/cares of the ..clients that go to him for  help in stabilizing disfunctional and revocable emotional patterns that so many of us come to learn about ourselves or/ the relationships that we are apart of, Im thankful for being one who can say my therapy with Sean has been Remarkable, Comfortable, Revocable, Interesting, Phenomenal and Intensely Educated. I can Safely say that my discovery of my New found feelings for my own personal self opposed to feelings being barricaded by my own fears of someone hurting me or taking away a foundation from my children that I'd hope to maintain until they became adults to protect themselves. The Anchor that had been matted down deep inside me with my childrens face on it cuffed in my bosom with the picture of a dark maze has been lifted for the the bottom of the pit of my seas. Now I Roar with a Big Roar and I have let go of thoes now Adult children with the help of 3yrs+ from Michael Sean Todd a Professional in a Pro position when it comes to holding the cares of desperate people stepping into his office. May all his Blessing be available to him through out his life..Shalom Sean.Perkins Law FirmMatt C. ratedMr. Perkins has guided our company from day one with contract negotiations, setting up employee handbooks, settling various disputes to anticipating the direction of our industry.  He is our 'go to' guy for all business ventures that start or end with needing legal advice.  Mr. Perkins's leadership with providing sound advice concerning employee disputes has kept us from encountering most issues.  Of those that have progressed, he was able to move us in a direction of safety.  I've known Timothy for years and can honestly attest that he possess the legal experience to match his proven intelligence and pleasant personality.  Running a business has so many challenges, I'm thankful to have the legal leadership of Mr. Perkins to guide our company’s success.Taylor Click & Mc Arthurtimmy.croom ratedHere at Taylor Click & Mc Arthur Law Firm;that sense of urgency, family orientation, and careful planning are all one word when it comes to integrity hard work and sacrifice. These attorneys have it all.  Mr. Richard Click recieved my case at a last minute worker's comp case gone terribly wrong.  Mr. Click is a warm caring GOD fearing christian that is not afrais to tackle the evil of injustice in this world as he fought dilligently against a major insurance company with only a week remaining in the case...  Well; shall I say, my family and I can now put all of our time into each other and God, and not so much into worry, stress, and bills and pain. Thank God for Mr. Richard Click, and blessing to Taylor Click & Mc ArthurOverstreet Lawproudmommy06 ratedI recently used Mrs. Overstreet on a case of mine and she was great. I am not one to understand a whole lot of the law at ease but she made it very easy for me to understand. She was there for me anytime I needed her and she understood what I was going through and exactly what I wanted. She always kept in touch with me and was always updating me on my case. She was very organized and had everything together when the court date rolled around. My case was won and she was awesome in the court room!! Needless to say, she will be my attorney from now on and is already working on something else for me. I highly recommend her. Overstreet Lawgiraffegirl ratedMrs. Overstreet is currently representing me and as someone who is going through a scary time in my life, she has been a great advocate and counselor for me. She understands that I don't know the laws and puts them in terms I can understand. I have been very happy with my decision to retain her services. She has been very professional and has met all the deadlines for me as promised. Hopefully I won't need that much more legal help but if I do, I will continue to seek her services. Roberts, Steven Attygrahamboudreaux ratedTop of the LineContrary to Prettyneat55 s point of view, in my experience Mr. Roberts is not only an exceptional attorney, he is also a truly good man. His sincerity and commitment to doing the most he can for his clients separates him at a time when many of his peers have chosen to follow the $$$ rather than uphold an attorney s commitment to seek justice. Mr. Roberts is both capable and kind, to which I can personally attest.Flexsenhar, Michael A JrDaniel M. ratedI would like to retract my previous review. Going through a custody battle is very hard and I wrote mike a review he did not deserve.  Mike is a grest lawyer. Mike did everything he could for a man in my situation and after he heard of my displeasure he went above and beyond to try and fix the situation. I apologize for my previous review and would highly recommend his services. The Law Office Of Craig & Lofton P Cmemphisham ratedIf I had to tell anyone about this Memphis Law Firm I would tell them that they need to pick up the phone and call them. The Craig and Lofton law office put me right at ease when calling them and talking with them. The worst thing in a town like Memphis is trying to handle things by yourself. Trust me it is not worth it to go alone on a legal case.Overstreet Lawdreamgirl09 ratedThis attorney really cares about her clients. She was there for me and understood what I wanted to do in my case and was there for me when I needed her. She is great on prices and a easy attorney to deal with. I am hard to understand law things but she made it easy and explain things easier for me. She will always be my only attorney for now on. :)Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
