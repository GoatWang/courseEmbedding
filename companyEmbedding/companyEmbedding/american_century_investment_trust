College Savings







Diversification does not assure a profit nor does it protect against loss of principal.





Certificates of deposit (CDs) offered through American Century Brokerage are issued by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured institutions, and are subject to change and availability. There is a $55 early termination fee and possible market value adjustments. Brokered CDs will fluctuate in market value between purchase date and maturity date due to their ability to be sold on the secondary market. Because the secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid, a significant loss of principal could result if your CD is sold prior to maturity. American Century Brokerage makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution and does not endorse or recommend the CDs in any way.





Brokerage Services are provided by American Century Brokerage, a division of American Century Investment Services, Inc., registered broker/dealer, member FINRA, SIPC.

Understanding Your Giftrust® Account














A Giftrust* is different than a regular mutual fund account in that it is also a trust account. Shares remain in the trust until the maturity date set by the grantor (or at least 18 years from account opening). If you are a Giftrust investor, the shares in your Giftrust become available to you once the Giftrust reaches its maturity date.
* The establishment of new Giftrust accounts has been discontinued as of June 21, 2017.
Common Giftrust Terminology

Beneficiary - The recipient of the Giftrust, for whom the Giftrust is established.
Grantor - The person who purchases and gives a Giftrust.
Maturity Date - A date set by the Grantor. On this date, the beneficiary gains access the All Cap Growth Fund shares in the Giftrust.
Trustee - This person administers the trust for the beneficiary.

Giftrust Tax Responsibilities
Before your Giftrust matures, you do not have to file any of the tax returns for your Giftrust. This is taken care of by the Giftrust trustee. After your Giftrust matures, you will be personally responsible for the necessary tax reporting and payment of taxes due on distributions or capital gains.
Register Your Giftrust Online
Stay connected to your Giftrust by registering your account online. To get started, you'll need your Giftrust Tax Identification (Tax ID) number which can be found on your initial investment confirmation.
If you cannot locate this number, please contact us. Follow the instructions and be sure to enter your Giftrust Tax ID where it asks for Employer Identification number.

What am I being asked to vote on?
Shareholders of each of the Issuers listed above are being asked to approve the election of four nominated Directors/Trustees (each a “Nominee” and collectively the “Nominees”) to the Board of Directors/Trustees of each Issuer.
When will the special meeting be held? Who can vote?
The special meeting (the “Meeting”) will be held on June 13, 2016, at 9:00 a.m. Central time at American Century Investments’ office at 4500 Main Street, Kansas City, Missouri, 64111. Please note, the Meeting is being held solely for the purpose of voting for the election of directors/trustees. No presentations about the Issuers’ funds (each a “Fund” and collectively the “Funds”) are planned. If you owned shares of one of the Funds at the close of business on April 1, 2016, you are entitled to vote, even if you later sold the shares. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per dollar of shares owned, with fractional dollars voting proportionally.
Why am I being asked to elect the Nominees to the Boards?
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Boards of Directors/Trustees (the “Boards”) are allowed to appoint new Board members to fill vacancies so long as immediately after such appointment, at least two-thirds of the directors/trustees have been elected by shareholders. Five of the seven current Directors/Trustees of each Issuer have been elected by shareholders. The two Directors/Trustees that have not been elected by shareholders were previously appointed by the Boards. Although more than two-thirds of the current Directors/Trustees were elected by shareholders, the Boards are unable to fill additional vacancies without a shareholder vote.
Who are the Nominees for election to the Boards of Directors/Trustees?
The Boards of Directors/Trustees have nominated Anne Casscells, Jonathan D. Levin, Tanya S. Beder and Jeremy I. Bulow for election by shareholders at the Meeting. You are being asked to elect Ms. Casscells and Dr. Levin to fill two vacant positions on each Issuer’s Board of Directors/Trustees. Ms. Casscells and Dr. Levin currently serve as advisory members to the Boards. You are also being asked to elect Ms. Beder and Dr. Bulow, both of whom currently serve on the Boards but have not previously been elected by shareholders. If the four nominated Directors/Trustees are elected, the Boards will have increased flexibility to appoint additional Board members in the future.
How do the Boards recommend that I vote?
The Boards, including all of the Independent Directors/Trustees, unanimously recommend you vote FOR the proposal. For a discussion of the factors the Boards considered in approving the proposal, see the accompanying materials.
My holdings in the Funds are small, why should I vote?
Your vote makes a difference. If many shareholders do not vote their proxies, an Issuer may not receive enough votes to go forward with its special meeting. This means additional costs will be incurred to solicit votes to determine the outcome of the proposal.
Why are multiple proxy cards enclosed?
You will receive a proxy card for each of the Funds in which you are a shareholder. In addition, if you own shares of the same Fund in multiple accounts that are titled differently, you will receive a proxy card for each account.
How do I cast my vote?
You may vote online, by phone, by mail or in person at the special meeting. To vote online, access the Web site listed on a proxy card. To vote by telephone, call the toll-free number listed on a proxy card. To vote online or by telephone, you will need the number that appears in the gray box on each of your proxy cards. To vote by mail, complete, sign and send us the enclosed proxy card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. You also may vote in person at the special meeting on June 13, 2016. If you need more information or have any questions on how to cast your vote, call our proxy solicitor, D. F. King & Co., Inc., at 1-877-361-7971.
What else do I need to know?
Shareholders of the issuer(s) as of April 1, 2016, are eligible to vote on the proposal and will receive a detailed proxy statement in mid-April, 2016.
If you are eligible, we encourage you to vote as soon as possible. The shareholder meeting is scheduled for June 13, 2016.
A proxy statement with respect to the information described above will be mailed to shareholders of record on April 18, 2016 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors are urged to read the proxy statement because it contains important information. The proxy statement and other relevant documents will be available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by calling 1-800-345-2021.

Unique Definition of Growth
The Growth team follows the philosophy that excess returns can be achieved by investing in companies with improving business fundamentals. They believe early recognition of signs of business improvement allows them to identify large company stocks near the beginning of a cycle of improving earnings, increasing earnings estimates, and expanding stock price multiples.
Risk-Aware Stock Selection
The team incorporates into the investment process a dynamic risk management strategy that is focused on understanding and quantifying all portfolio risks. The aim is to reduce unintended risks, such as sector and industry concentrations, and to align the portfolio with stock-specific risk that the team believes will be rewarded over time.


Fundamentally Driven
The strength of the Growth process lies in the team's bottom-up process that emphasizes rigorous fundamental company research to identify business improvement. Thus, the fund tends to outperform in markets where the direction of stock prices are driven more by fundamentals than by transitory factors.


*Growth has a proven record of performance with less risk than the peers
A Note About Risk
The value and/or returns of a portfolio will fluctuate with market and economic conditions. There is no guarantee that the investment objectives will be met. Dividends and yields represent past performance and there is no guarantee that they will continue to be paid.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Morningstar ratings are based upon Investor class of shares, unless otherwise indicated. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



N1

The Morningstar Investment Style Box™ reveals a fund's investment strategy. For the equity holdings in the fund's portfolio, the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend or growth).

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Fulfill important philanthropic commitments

We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.

We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Operations[edit]
The company has approximately 1,300 employees and its headquarters are located at 4500 Main in Kansas City, Missouri, near the Country Club Plaza; the company also has offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, Mountain View, California and Kansas City, Missouri.
History[edit]
The company was founded by James E. Stowers, Jr. in 1958 as "Twentieth Century Mutual Funds". After both suffering from cancer, Stowers and his wife founded the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in 1994. The Stowers dedicated their personal fortune to endow the Institute with gifts totaling $2 billion. Today the 600,000-square-foot (56,000 m2) biomedical research facility is situated on a 10-acre (40,000 m2) campus in the heart of Kansas City, near the headquarters of American Century Investments. More than 40% of ACI's profits support research to find cures for such genetically based diseases as cancer, diabetes, and dementia.[1][2]
In 2011, JP Morgan Chase sold their 41% stake in ACI to Toronto based bank CIBC.[3][4] CIBC resold its stake to Nomura Holdings for around $1 billion as it could not gain full control of ACI. The stake gave Nomura 10.1% of the voting rights.[5]

Operations[edit]
The company has approximately 1,300 employees and its headquarters are located at 4500 Main in Kansas City, Missouri, near the Country Club Plaza; the company also has offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, Mountain View, California and Kansas City, Missouri.
History[edit]
The company was founded by James E. Stowers, Jr. in 1958 as "Twentieth Century Mutual Funds". After both suffering from cancer, Stowers and his wife founded the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in 1994. The Stowers dedicated their personal fortune to endow the Institute with gifts totaling $2 billion. Today the 600,000-square-foot (56,000 m2) biomedical research facility is situated on a 10-acre (40,000 m2) campus in the heart of Kansas City, near the headquarters of American Century Investments. More than 40% of ACI's profits support research to find cures for such genetically based diseases as cancer, diabetes, and dementia.[1][2]
In 2011, JP Morgan Chase sold their 41% stake in ACI to Toronto based bank CIBC.[3][4] CIBC resold its stake to Nomura Holdings for around $1 billion as it could not gain full control of ACI. The stake gave Nomura 10.1% of the voting rights.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
