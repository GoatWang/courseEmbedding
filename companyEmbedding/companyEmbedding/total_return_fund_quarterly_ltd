 ABOUT INTERVAL FUNDS
In today’s ever-changing markets, many investors are demanding more sophisticated investment choices.  Rather than sticking to traditional mutual fund opportunities, everyday investors are looking to a new approach that combines what we believe are the best attributes of both open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds. Here’s what you should know about interval funds and why they’re quickly gaining popularity:

Perhaps the biggest advantage of an interval fund is that it can invest in both public and private securities. Exposure to private companies and institutional products can help create a well-balanced portfolio with benefits including the potential for:








Greater Yield
Reduced Volatility
Lower Correlation to Equities


 

In summary, interval funds are possibly best described as a middle ground between open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds and, as illustrated below, interval funds share attractive attributes of both.











MARKET OPPORTUNITY







BANK CONSOLIDATION
Bank consolidation has created a compelling yield premium for non-bank lenders:
There are approximately 4,700a fewer domestic banks today than there were 20 years ago
The participation rate of the remaining banks has been reduced from ~70% to less than 10%a

LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT
Middle Market loans can provide a meaningful opportunity regardless of interest rate movement:
Attractive yield in a low rate environment
Improved income potential from rising rates over time

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Sierra Total Return Fund seeks to provide attractive risk-adjusted income and returns.

Through these strategies, Sierra Total Return Fund can access both public and private securities at all levels of the capital structure with varying correlation to equity and other markets.

Secured and unsecured 








Public Investment Opportunities6


Business development companies (“BDCs”) and mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Closed-end funds and other income equities










Private Investment Opportunities7


Credit opportunities
Real estate opportunities








Pooled Credit8


Debt and equity of Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)

Click here for the Prospectus

Sierra Total Return Fund is new and has a limited operating history.
1) Medley Management Inc. is the parent company of Medley LLC and several registered investment advisors (collectively, “Medley”). Assets under management refers to assets of our funds, which represents the sum of the net asset value of such funds, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund level, including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). 2) Assets under management are as of September 30, 2016. 3) Distributions are not guaranteed and are made at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and will depend on Sierra Total Return Fund earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our Registered Investment Company (“RIC”) status and other factors the Sierra Total Return Fund Board may deem relevant. 4) There currently is no secondary market for Sierra Total Return Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. To provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase its shares at net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to provide this intended level of liquidity. 5) Public and Private Credit are part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Loan Strategy. 6) Public Investment Opportunities are part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Public Investment Fund Strategy. 7) Private Investment Opportunities are part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Private Investment Fund Strategy. 8) Pooled Credit is part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Structured Products Strategy. 9) As described more fully in the prospectus, the Fund intends to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares on a quarterly basis. The Fund is an interval fund and, as such, has adopted a fundamental policy to make one repurchase offer of each class of outstanding shares at the NAV of that class of shares per year. In addition to this mandatory repurchase offer, the Fund intends to make three additional repurchase offers in each year. 
RISK DISCLOSURES
There currently is no secondary market for Sierra Total Return Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. To provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase its shares at net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to provide this intended level of liquidity. Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV.
 
Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any securities exchange, which makes them inherently illiquid. Regardless of how the Fund performs, an investor may not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate his or her shares whenever such investor would prefer and will be unable to reduce his or her exposure or any market downturn. The Fund may pay distributions in significant part from sources that may not be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance.
 
Investing in the Fund involves risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective depends, in part, on the ability of its investment adviser to effectively allocate the assets of the Fund among the various securities and investments in which the Fund invests. There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the Fund’s investment objective or delivering positive returns. The Fund is newly organized and has a limited operating history.
 
Investors should be aware that traded and non-traded BDCs, senior loans, real estate investments and REITs, structured products and CLOs are all significantly different investments each with its own risks, rewards and limitations. Investors should understand these differences (which may include investment objectives, costs and expenses, liquidity, market risk, safety, fluctuation of principal or return, insurance, tax features, interest rate risk and consequences, etc.) before making an investment.
 
SC Distributors is the exclusive wholesale marketing agent for Sierra Total Return Fund. ALPS Distributors, Inc. is the distributor of Sierra Total Return Fund. SC Distributors and ALPS Distributors, Inc. are not affiliated. ALPS Distributor, Inc., 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203, member FINRA.
 
The Fund will concentrate its investments in debt and equity fixed income and its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the debt/credit markets. The value of companies engaged in the debt/credit industry is affected by: (i) changes in general economic and market conditions; (ii) changes in the value of debt investments; (iii) risks related to local economic conditions and increased competition and (iv) changes in interest rates and leverage.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Sierra Total Return Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting www.sierratotalreturnfund.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Risk Factors


Investing in our shares involves a number of significant risks. You should consider carefully the information found in the “Risk Factors” section of our prospectus before making an investment in our shares. The risks involved in investing in us include, but are not limited to: 
(1) Because the Fund is newly organized, its shares have no pricing or performance history.
(2) The Fund has no minimum asset threshold that must be satisfied prior to launch. The amount of capital actually raised by the Fund may be insufficient to allow the Fund to realize its investment objective, which may adversely affect the Fund’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
(3) Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any securities exchange, which makes them inherently illiquid.
(4) There is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares, and it is not anticipated that a secondary market will develop.
(5) Shares of the Fund are not redeemable.
(6) In order to provide some liquidity to its shareholders, the Fund intends to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares on a quarterly basis. One of the Fund’s repurchase offers will be conducted pursuant to a fundamental policy, pursuant to which the Fund intends to offer to repurchase 5% of its outstanding shares on a non-discretionary basis in the third calendar quarter of each year. Subject to the Fund’s discretion, the remaining three repurchase offers are intended to be in the first, second and fourth calendar quarters of each year and in such amounts as the Fund’s board of trustees may determine in its sole discretion. There can be no assurance, however, that any Discretionary Repurchase will be made. In addition, you will be charged an early withdrawal charge of 1.00% if you elect to have the Fund repurchase your Class T shares during the first year of your purchase.
(7) You should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time. 
(8) Regardless of how the Fund performs, an investor may not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate his or her shares whenever such investor would prefer and will be unable to reduce his or her exposure on any market downturn.
(9) If and to the extent that a public trading market ever develops, shares of closed-end investment companies, such as the Fund, may have a tendency to trade frequently at a discount from their NAV per share, which is determined daily, and initial offering prices.
(10) The amount of distributions that the Fund may pay, if any, is uncertain.
(11) The Fund may pay distributions in significant part from sources that may not be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance, such as from offering proceeds, borrowings, and amounts from the Fund’s affiliates that are subject to repayment by investors.

Overview


 




Fund Overview
A solid core bond choice for millions of investors
Since 1987, the fund has focused on maximizing total return potential while protecting principal. That emphasis has helped it deliver attractive returns through the ups and downs of bond market cycles.
Why Invest In This Fund
Quality, diversification, flexibility
The fund emphasizes higher-quality, intermediate-term bonds and aims to avoid concentration risk by being more globally diversified than many core bond funds. It also has considerable flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions, helping to manage risk and increase total return potential.
Strong long-term returns
Since inception, the fund has helped anchor investors' portfolios as a true core bond holding. Its flexibility and risk-focused approach have helped it deliver attractive returns across varying market and interest rate environments.
A risk-focused approach
Unlike funds that simply seek the highest yield, the fund aims to provide investors with a combination of income and capital appreciation potential. It is guided by a forward-looking, risk-focused philosophy that aims to identify risk early while also being positioned to capture attractive returns.
Our Expertise
The fund's expert portfolio management team – Scott Mather is CIO U.S. Core Strategies, Mark Kiesel is CIO Global Credit and Mihir Worah is CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation – is supported by the full spectrum of PIMCO's global resources and our four decades of active bond management experience.

Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results.

A word about risk: Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, interest-rate, issuer, credit, and inflation risk; investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. The value of most bond funds and fixed income securities are impacted by changes in interest rates.Bonds and bond funds with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations;bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations,and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield,lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market's value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not ensure against loss.

1The distribution yield for monthly paying Funds is calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the monthly period ended on the date shown and dividing by the net asset value on the last business day for the same period. The distribution yield for quarterly paying Funds is calculated by taking the average of the prior four quarterly distribution yields. The quarterly distribution yields are calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the quarterly period ended on the most recent quarterly distribution date and dividing by the net asset value for the same date.

Performance quoted represents past performance and is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Market-Based NAV (Per Share): The Market-Based NAV is the net asset value per share, calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) rounded to the fourth decimal place.  The Market-Based NAV is not indicative of future Market-Based NAVs or the future performance of any of the Funds and classes set forth above. The Market-Based NAV may change daily and may deviate from $1.0000 even when financial markets are stable. Although the Market-Based NAV is intended to reflect the price at which a Fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.


Money Market funds are not insured or guaranteed by FDIC or any other government agency and although such funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in Money Market funds.

Prices & Performance Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures

             Performance figures presented reflect the total return performance after fees and reflect changes in share price and reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions on the payable date. All periods longer than one year are annualized.
        

             Total return performance does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The minimum initial investment for Institutional class shares is $1 million; however, it may be modified for certain financial intermediaries who submit trades on behalf of eligible investors. 


The Fund returns are since the Fund's inception and the index returns are since 04/30/1987.
        

             Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.
        

             Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.

Morningstar Ranking for the Intermediate-Term Bond category as of 12/31/2015 for the Inst. Class Shares; other classes may have different performance characteristics. The Morningstar Rankings are calculated by Morningstar and are based on the total return performance, with distributions reinvested and operating expenses deducted. Morningstar does not take into account sales charges. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved.

Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures

             Portfolio information in the charts is based on the fund's net assets. These percentages may differ from those used for the fund's compliance calculations, including the fund's prospectus, regulatory, and other investment limitations and policies, which may be based on total assets of the fund or other measurements, may include or exclude various categories of investments from those covered in the portfolio allocation categories shown in this report, and may be based on different classifications and measurements of the fund’s investments and other criteria.
        

             References to specific sectors, securities or issuers are for illustrative purposes only. All holdings are subject to change daily. All share classes have the same portfolio but different expenses.
        

             Duration is a measure of a portfolio’s price sensitivity expressed in years. Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.

Disclosures 




Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:
Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested.  Diversification does not ensure against loss.
        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.
