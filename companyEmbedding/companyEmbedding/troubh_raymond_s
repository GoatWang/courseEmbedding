Ray Troubh (born May 3, 1926) is an independent financial consultant who served as a general partner at Lazard from 1961 to 1974 and as interim chairman at Enron from 2002 to 2004.
Career[edit]
Troubh graduated from Bowdoin College in 1950 and earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1952. Early in his legal career he clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harold Hitz Burton. From 1954-58 he was an associate in the firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, in New York. He was treasurer of the Lazard Fund from 1958 to 1960, associate with Lazard Freres & Co. from 1961 to 1968, and partner in that firm from 1968 to1974. In 1974 he founded Troubh & Co., a financial consulting firm.
He is a former governor of the American Stock Exchange and has a long record of service on corporate boards. In November 2001 he was called upon to be a member of the board at Enron and to be one of three members investigating corporate misconduct at Enron. He currently serves as interim board chair at Enron. Director's Alert named him one of nine Outstanding Directors in Corporate America 2002 "for lending a steady, cool and honest hand to boardrooms across corporate America in times of turmoil, most particularly in guiding Enron through crisis."

Raymond S Troubh's Experience
Title: Director
               Company: Diamond Offshore Drilling , Inc.
Job Details
               Company Size: $1 bil and above - Employee Range: 5,000 to less than 25,000. Diamond Offshore is a leader in offshore drilling, providing contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a total fleet of 30 offshore drilling rigs, including one under construction. Diamond Offshore's fleet consists of 21 semisubmersibles, of which one harsh environment semi is under construction, four dynamically positioned drillships, and five jack-ups.
Title: Chairman
               Company: Triarc Companies Inc
Job Details
               Triarc Companies, Inc. is a holding company and, through its subsidiaries, the franchisor of the Arby'sÂ® restaurant system and the owner and operator of over 1,000 Arby's restaurants located in the United States. With approximately 3,700 restaurants primarily in the United States, Arby's is the largest restaurant chain specializing in the roast beef sandwich segment of the quick service restaurant ("QSR") industry in the United States. According to Nation's Restaurant News, Arby's is the 12th largest QSR chain overall. The Arby's experience aims to offer a premium menu at QSR speed. Anchoring Arby's menu for the past 40 years is its unique roast beef sandwich, as well as other signature products. Arby's also has an extensive line of premium products under the Market FreshÂ® brand name. The Market Fresh line of products includes sandwiches, wraps, toasted subs and salads. To facilitate its transition to a "pure play" restaurant company and to reduce corporate costs, Triarc has consolidated substantially all of its corporate operations and headquarters in Atlanta, GA with its Arby's Restaurant Group ("ARG") operations and has transferred its senior executive responsibilities from its New York City offices to the ARG executive team in Atlanta. The transition is expected to result in significant annual corporate cost savings. The amount of such savings has yet to be finalized. In connection with the corporate restructuring, and in light of the departure of nearly all of the senior members of Triarc's former management team, Triarc entered into a 2-year transition services agreement with Trian Fund Management, L.P. ("Trian Mgmt."), an investment management firm that was founded in November 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, pursuant to which Trian Mgmt. provides Triarc with a range of services to be the former Triarc officers and employees who are employed by Trian Mgmt., including consultation and advice in connection with strategy, mergers and acquisitions, capital markets transactions, legal, accounting, tax, corporate development, finance and investment banking, investor relations and corporate communications and other professional and strategic services. Peltz and May, who together beneficially own approximately 10.7 million shares of Class A Common Stock and 13.9 million shares of Class B Common Stock, Series 1, constituting approximately 34% of Triarc's voting power, continue to be large shareholders of Triarc. Peltz currently serves as non-executive Chairman of Triarc and May as non-executive Vice Chairman of Triarc. Triarc Companies, Inc. has a capital structure that utilizes two classes of common stock: Class A (NYSE ticker symbol: TRY) and Class B, Series 1 (NYSE ticker symbol TRY.B). Triarc's corporate predecessor was incorporated in Ohio in 1929. Triarc was reincorporated in Delaware, by means of a merger, in June 1994.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
