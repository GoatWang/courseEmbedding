                Andbank is in talks to purchase family offices in Brazil
            



                Bank plans to launch an open, digital-investment platform
            



Andbank, the Andorran private bank with $26 billion under management, is joining the rush to grab market share among wealthy Brazilians living in Miami.The micro-state’s largest bank has hired seven people for its Latin America private-banking business in Miami in 2017, bringing the total to 22, and could add as many as eight more by year-end, Carlos Moreno de Tejada, Andbank’s managing director and head of Americas, said in an interview in Sao Paulo.“We’re interviewing at least one banker or independent financial adviser a week,” Tejada, a native Spaniard, said. “Competition for hiring in Miami is fierce and obtaining a visa is becoming a serious difficulty.”








Miami is a destination of choice for many Brazilians given its proximity to Latin America, cultural identity and similar climate. Brazilian financial institutions including Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Grupo BTG Pactual, XP Investimentos CCTVM SA and Banco Bradesco SA already have offices there. A recent tax-amnesty program freed up as much as $52 billion in assets to invest as many Brazilians brought their now legalized fortunes from fiscal havens to the South Florida city.Andbank opened its Miami brokerage unit three years ago, aiming at clients with at least $1 million to invest. “The market is tough, but we’ve had exponential growth,” said Carlos Gribel, head of fixed income at Andbanc Brokerage in the city.Swiss TransfersThe Miami unit manages about $800 million, including assets in its broker-dealer and investment-advisory business. Since October, after the amnesty program, there was a big inflow of money coming from Swiss banks to the U.S., where private banking rates are “much cheaper,” he said.




Andbank is also hoping to expand its business in Brazil. The local unit plans to hire three more people this year, boosting headcount to 17. It’s also in advanced talks for possible acquisitions of local family offices, according to Leonardo Marques Hojaij, the company’s private-banking superintendent in Brazil.“There are several mid-size family offices that have between 500 million reais ($157 million) and 1 billion reais under management that struggle to run independently but that could be relevant to us,” Hojaij said, adding that a deal may be reached by year-end.




Andbank is only looking into deals that allow it to be a majority shareholder, Tejada added.

Andbank’s plans follow UBS Group AG’s agreement to purchase a majority stake in Consenso Investimentos Ltda., Brazil’s biggest independent multi-family office, becoming the latest Swiss bank to bet on the industry’s growth. Total assets under management in the private-banking industry in Brazil increased almost 17 percent last year, to 831.6 billions reais, according to December data from Anbima, the capital-markets association. For 2017, a large influx of initial public offerings and mergers should add to that growth.Andbank’s other plan to gain ground in Brazil involves launching a digital investment platform that offers clients the possibility of buying products from a range of banks and hedge funds -- a similar strategy to the one that made XP Investimentos the nation’s third-biggest brokerage by equity-trading volume.“Brazil is where we are investing now,” Tejada said. “In Latin America, this is the place to be.”

EXCLUSIVE-Neoenergia seeks $11 bln valuation in dual Brazil, U.S. listing, sources say

sources say@
SAO PAULO, July 14 (Reuters) - Neoenergia SA, whose takeover of a smaller rival will turn it into Brazil's No. 1 power utility by customers served, is working on a dual initial public offering in São Paulo and New York that could value it at 35 billion reais ($11 billion), three people with direct knowledge of the plan said.
The IPO could be launched around September, when the people expect Neoenergia SA to have won industry regulatory approval for Elektro Eletricidade & Serviços SA's takeover. Antitrust agency Cade gave the nod to the takeover on July 4.

Spain's Iberdrola SA will have 52.4 percent of Neoenergia once the takeover is completed. The dual listing will be a so-called secondary offer, allowing Banco do Brasil SA and pension fund Previ Fundação to sell part of their 9.4-percent and 38-percent stakes, respectively, in Neoenergia, the people said.
Banco do Brasil and Previ declined to comment. Iberdrola did not immediately comment. Neoenergia said "no decision has been taken yet on a potential IPO." The people spoke under condition of anonymity because the plan remains private.
Listing Neoenergia in both stock markets would give the utility access to wide base of investors seeking greater exposure to an industry that for years has struggled with erratic policies, a harsh recession and high borrowing costs.
Chinese power conglomerates have become the dominant force in Brazil's power industry with high-profile acquisitions that have resulted in delistings. State Grid Corp of China's $12.1 billion purchase of CPFL Energia SA - the largest-ever foreign acquisition in Brazil - involves a buyout of small shareholders.
INVESTMENT BANKS
When announcing the Elektro acquisition on June 8, Iberdrola committed to list Neoenergia when Previ and Banco do Brasil "deemed it appropriate."
Neoenergia's business scope includes power generation, transmission and distribution across Brazil, in an area almost five times as big as Iberdrola's in Spain. With 13.4 million customers in Brazil, the Elektro deal could be followed by a transfer of Iberdrola's windfarm assets to the combined entity.
Banco do Brasil, the country's No. 1 state-controlled lender, is looking for investment-banking peers to help it underwrite the IPO, two of the people said, naming Banco Santander Brasil SA, Morgan Stanley & Co and Credit Suisse Group AG as candidates.
Other local investment banks vying for underwriting roles include Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA, the people said.
The banks declined to comment.
In the wake of the Elektro acquisition, Neoenergia said combined annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 3.6 billion reais ($1.12 billion) last year on a proforma basis, on revenue of about 31 billion reais.
If successful, Neoenergia's IPO may be one of Brazil's largest this year. The last stock market debut of a Brazilian electricity company in Brazil took place in July 2013, when CPFL Energias Renováveis SA raised about 364 million reais ($113 million) from investors.
Still, efforts by President Michel Temer's administration to undo some of the policies of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff - who imposed caps on project returns and renegotiated contracts that led to copious losses - have revived industry equity offerings.
Over the past year, utilities have raised 3.6 billion reais through equity offerings, more than in the prior four years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Omega Geração SA expects to price a 1.4 billion-real IPO on July 27.

Caixa Econômica Federal SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA, Banco do Brasil SA and Banco Bradesco SA are urging larger rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA to join the plan, under which JBS would get a 12-month repayment extension in exchange for a 2 billion-real upfront payment and extra collateral, two of the people said. In principle, banks would not adjust the borrowing cost of those loans because the risk of JBS failing to honor them remains very small, according to one of the people, who asked for anonymity because the plan remains private. Bloomberg News reported on July 12 that a definitive accord had been struck. São Paulo-based JBS said in a statement that the company "remains engaged in a long-term relation with financial institutions, with which it has so far maintained productive and constructive talks." The banks declined to comment. A refinancing deal is key to stem concerns of a potential liquidity strain at JBS, whose borrowing costs surged in the wake of the Batista family's decision to enter plea and leniency deals related to their involvement in a bribery and graft ring. Shares (JBSS3.SA) of the São Paulo-based meatpacker and food processor have tanked 18 percent since brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista agreed to a plea deal in mid-May.

Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista, the elder of the two brothers who control JBS, is personally negotiating the debt refinancing deal and asset sales to raise cash, the people said. JBS's private-sector banks remain skittish about their state peers' push to remove Batista, two of the people said. Itaú fretted about refinancing loans to JBS in early talks, demanding immediate repayment of a 1 billion-real credit facility due within weeks, the people said. Itaú is not participating in any of JBS's planned asset divestitures, one of the people said. Bribing Politicians Removing Batista has become common ground between government lenders BNDES and Caixa Econômica Federal, Reuters reported on June 22. BNDES owns 22 percent of JBS through investment arm BNDES Participações SA.  Caixa, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, is JBS's largest creditor. The refinancing underscores the challenge facing the Batista brothers, who over a decade transformed JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwestern plains into a global behemoth that operates in four continents, with the help of political relations and low-cost government loans. In May, the brothers admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians to facilitate the growth of JBS through BNDES loans.

Business: Washington Post Business Page, Business News
























Itau's Miami Growth Fueled by Brazil Investors Escaping MessJonathan LevinJul 13, 2017 8:01 am ET(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s Itau Unibanco Holding SA says its Miami private-banking business is booming despite the political and economic crisis at home.Or perhaps because of it.“In bad environments, it grows for diversification,” Carlos Constantini, Itau’s head of international private banking, said in an interview in Miami. “Latin American investors look for alternatives to hedge their savings, and sending money abroad and having different currencies and jurisdictions has always been, and continues to be, one alternative to diversify.”For all the bad news coming out of Brazil -- former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday became the latest politician convicted of bribe-taking and money-laundering -- assets at Itau’s U.S. private bank have jumped fourfold in the past decade. The business now oversees about $12 billion, up from $10.8 billion at the end of last year, according to a staff presentation marking the Miami office’s 10-year anniversary.Constantini, who is also chief executive officer of Itau’s U.S. operation, said the bank is forging ahead with its international-growth strategy despite an uncertain economic recovery and political-corruption scandals in Brazil, where Itau is the biggest bank by market capitalization. The goal for the next five years is to become the top bank for Brazilians investing abroad, up from its third-place ranking. JPMorgan Chase & Co. lays claim to the No. 1 spot. Itau wants to increase its market share to 15 percent from about 10 percent, Constantini said, adding that he expects demand to increase as Brazil interest rates drop and tax amnesty frees up more clients’ assets to invest. Watch a QuickTake video about Brazil’s economic challengesLast year’s amnesty bill allowed citizens and companies to declare previously undisclosed assets held abroad, provided they pay a fine and taxes. Sao Paulo-based Banco Bradesco SA, which earlier this year announced plans for its own office in Miami Beach, has said the amnesty law would free up a multibillion-dollar pool of assets formerly under wraps.To open a Miami account, Itau’s private-banking clients in Brazil generally need at least 5 million reais ($1.6 million) to invest, with $1 million or more allocated in the U.S.As Brazil recovers from a bout of stagflation, investors will have another reason to send some of their money abroad: Sky-high interest rates that had been running at around 1 percent a month will eventually normalize, forcing investors to look elsewhere for returns.Brazilians have long had a special relationship with Miami. In the heady days of Brazil’s economic boom, they took advantage of a strong currency and poured savings into condominiums there. As Brazil lost favor amid an ever-deepening government corruption scandal, deflated commodities prices and a ballooning national debt, they moved money to the U.S. to protect it. “The offshore private-bank pie grows in good and bad environments,” Constantini said. Real EstateLast year, Brazilians bought at least $861 million in South Florida homes, more than any other nationality except Venezuelans, according to the Miami Association of Realtors. And they spent the most on average of any foreign nationality -- $775,000 per home, up from $766,000 in 2015, according to the data, which showed that a majority of the transactions were all-cash.Constantini said the growth of the U.S. operation is partly a defensive move that reflects wealthy Brazilians’ migration patterns: They often start with just a vacation home, and later decide to start businesses or raise children in the U.S.“We have to be prepared, because we don’t want to see families saying, ‘Sorry, you’re not serving me in the U.S., so I will be someone else’s client,” Constantini said.--With assistance from Felipe Marques and Cristiane Lucchesi ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Brazil's J&F sells Havaianas maker for $1.1 bln


 Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda, Itaúsa Investimentos SA and the fund Brasil Warrant will split J&F's 86 percent stake in Alpargatas J&F's owners Joesley and Wesley Batista will use proceeds from the transaction to repay a 2.7 billion-real acquisition financing loan

Havaianas store flip flops


J&F Investimentos SA has agreed to sell a controlling stake in Havaianas flip-flop maker Alpargatas SA to the investment firms of Brazil's most prominent banking families for 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion), according to securities filings on Wednesday.
Under terms of the deal, Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda, Itaúsa Investimentos SA and the fund Brasil Warrant will split J&F's 86 percent stake in Alpargatas, the filling said. Both had bid 3.3 billion reais for Alpargatas before talks appeared to have collapsed, Reuters reported on Sunday.
The much-awaited sale is the first by J&F, the holding company overseeing the fortune of Brazil's billionaire Batista family, since it was slammed with a record-setting leniency fine linked to a corruption probe. Proceeds from the sale will go to help repay J&F's debt and speed up payments on the 10.3 billion-real fine, people told Reuters on Sunday.

The filings said the Cambuhy-led group will pay 14.25 reais for each Alpargatas common share and 11.40 reais for each preferred share.
São Paulo-based Alpargatas makes Havaianas flip flops worn by celebrities from Blake Lively to Jennifer Aniston. Its shares had surged 56 percent this year on expectations of a sale. Alpargatas also manages a wide array of Brazilian fashion brands including beachwear brand Osklen.
Itaúsa oversees the fortune of Brazil's Villela and Setubal families, who control São Paulo-based Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Latin America's largest bank by assets. Cambuhy is the family office of Brazil's billionaire Moreira Salles family, also a major Itaú shareholder.
Reuters first reported the Cambuhy-led bid on June 16.



Brothers

Banco Bradesco BBI advised J&F on the deal, while JPMorgan Chase & Co worked for the consortium of buyers.
According to people with knowledge of the situation, J&F's owners Joesley and Wesley Batista will use proceeds from the transaction to repay a 2.7 billion-real acquisition financing loan they took with state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal.
The loan is under investigation by Brazil's audit court TCU for potential irregularities. The brothers signed a leniency deal in May after admitting to bribing almost 1,900 politicians to obtain cheap government loans for their businesses.
The Batistas had acquired Alpargatas in December 2015 from construction conglomerate Camargo Correa SA, which was ensnared in the same scandal - "Operation Car Wash". In addition to the Caixa loan, the Batistas will also have to pay for financing they took to buy out minority shareholders.
Other J&F-controlled assets on the block are dairy producer Fábrica de Produtos Alimentícios Vigor SA, pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA and a pool of power transmission lines, people directly involved in the situation said.
J&F expects to raise around 10 billion reais with asset sales and cut J&F debts by another 10 billion reais, Reuters reported last week.

The family at the center of Brazil’s political crisis agreed to sell its stake in the Havaianas flip-flop business for 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion), part of an asset selloff to pay down legal settlements.The deal hands control of one of the nation’s most iconic consumer brands to Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda. and Brasil Warrant, both run by the Moreira Salles family, and Itausa - Investimentos Itau SA, backed by the Setubal family. The investors will pay 14.25 reais per common share and 11.40 reais per preferred share to acquire 54 percent of Havaianas parent company Alpargatas SA, according to a statement Wednesday.The transaction marks the end of an almost two-year period where Havaianas was under the control of J&F Investimentos, the holding company of brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista. The firm agreed last month to pay 10.3 billion reais as part of a leniency agreement with Brazilian authorities after the brothers, who run meat producer JBS SA, confessed to graft and other crimes. The admissions have led to a spiraling scandal that put President Michel Temer’s mandate in jeopardy.

The move comes less than a month after J&F said it was in talks to sell pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA to Chile’s Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion SA, which made an offer of about 14 billion reais ($4 billion) including debt, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. J&F plans to raise at least 8 billion reais through divestments that also include dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA, S&P Global Ratings said in a report last month.Alpargatas rose 1.4 percent to 14.20 reais at the close Wednesday, the highest since November 2013.The Batista brothers agreed to buy control of Alpargatas in late 2015 using a 2.67 billion-real loan from government-owned Caixa Economica Federal in a deal that’s being investigated by the country’s audit court.




Cambuhy was established in 2011 by the billionaire co-chairman of Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Pedro Moreira Salles, who has a 31 percent stake in the private equity firm. The Moreira Salles clan, with a combined fortune of about $20.8 billion, and the Setubals are the families who jointly control Itau, Latin America’s largest bank by market value.Buying Havaianas gives new owners a brand worn by the likes of Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow. The footwear sits atop the global flip-flop hierarchy, with a Swarovski-encrusted pair retailing for $70 at Saks Fifth Avenue.
