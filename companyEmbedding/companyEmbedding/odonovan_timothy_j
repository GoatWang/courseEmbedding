Emily Zoladz | The Grand Rapids PressFormer Wolverine World Wide CEO Timothy O’Donovan is being inducted into the Junior Achievement Hall of Fame. ROCKFORD — Even in retirement, former Wolverine World Wide CEO Timothy O’Donovan keeps a busy schedule. But the pace has slowed a bit.

“(It’s) sort of evolved from running 100 miles an hour to running 50 miles an hour in things I was interested in,” he said.
BIO BOX
Timothy O’Donovan
Career: 39 years at Wolverine World Wide Inc., Rockford (CEO 2000-2007)
Personal: Married to Karen for 41 years, two sons and two grandchildren
Volunteer work: He is chairman of Spectrum Health Services Inc. and serves on the boards of United Way and Two-Ten International Footwear Foundation and is on the executive committee of the Grand Rapids Symphony.
Education: B.S. degree in industrial administration from Iowa State University; MBA in finance/marketing from Michigan State UniversityIn December, the 64-year-old O’Donovan stepped down as chairman of the board of directors after 39 years with the Rockford shoe company.

But he remains on the board for the $1.1 billion company and chairs the board of the area’s largest hospital system, Spectrum Health Services Inc.
He still lends his wisdom serving on the boards of public companies Spartan Stores Inc., Kaydon Corp., and private firms Amerikam and Cascade Engineering.
Despite his work and volunteer efforts, he says he was surprised when he learned he would be inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Junior Achievement of the Michigan Great Lakes.
He will be honored at the JA annual dinner Wednesday at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in downtown Grand Rapids.
Wolverine CEO Blake Krueger says he was not surprised by O’Donovan’s selection. He will join 74 other business leaders who have been inducted in the Hall of Fame, recognized for their accomplishments, community involvement and efforts to serve as a role model for youth.
“Tim and (his wife) Karen are some of the best people I know in Grand Rapids. They have been very generous in giving their time and money,” Krueger said.
IF YOU GO
Awards ceremony
What: Junior Achievement West Michigan Hall of Fame dinner
When: 6:30 p.m. Wednesday
Where: Amway Grand Hotel Plaza
Cost: $250 per person. Table sponsorship also available.
More details: 616-575-9080  or westmichigan.ja.orgO’Donovan’s nearly 40-year career with Wolverine began shortly after he finished his MBA at Michigan State University. He was recruited by then-CEO Alfred Seeyle, a former dean of MSU’s school of business who the Krause family brought in to run Wolverine.

Seeyle hired O’Donovan even though he would have to take a two-year leave after his first year to complete his Reserve Officers Training Corps.
In his early career at Wolverine, O’Donovan worked in finance, special projects, product management, sales management and general management across all the brands.
The variety of jobs made his career interesting, he said. 
“I loved going to work every day.”
One of his most important days came when, as president, he received a phone call from a business associate at L.L. Bean who alerted him that a private equity group was putting outdoor shoe company Merrell up for sale.
He immediately walked around the corner to tell then-CEO Geoffrey Bloom. Bloom agreed with O’Donovan’s assessment  and led the acquisition team to buy the Vermont maker of hiking boots for $17 million in 1997.
“It’s been critical to the company’s success,” O’Donovan said.
At the time, no one had dreamed of the Jungle Moc moccasins. But the entire Merrell brand turned out to be wildly popular.
Along with the hot-selling mocs, Merrell now accounts for about a quarter of Wolverine’s sales. 
Merrell, which now includes an apparel line, is expected to be the company’s first billion dollar brand. 
“It turned out to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that helps define a company,” O’Donovan said.
Other inductees
Junior Achievement will honor other business leaders at Wednesday’s event:
Juan Olivarez: The past president of Grand Rapids Community College and president of the Kalamazoo Community Foundation will receive a Bronze Leadership award. Olivarez is being recognized for his years of service to JA.
Diane Kniowski: The president and general manager of WOOD-TV will receive a Bronze Leadership award. She served on the JA board of directors for many years, including two as chairwoman. 
Charles and Patricia Johnson:  The Muskegon residents will receive the Edward J. Frey Sr. Distinguished Achievement Award for service to the community and contributing to the quality of life and the business climate in West Michigan.

Charles Johnson: Past chairman, president and chief operation officer of SPX Corp., where he served from 1964 until his retirement in 2007. He is president of the Paul C. Johnson Foundation and chairman of the Downtown Muskegon Development Corp.
Patricia Johnson: President emeritus of the Community Foundation of Muskegon County and on the boards of several organizations, including the Muskegon Museum of Art, Aquinas College and Mercy Hospital.
