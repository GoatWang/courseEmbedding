Mining in Idaho
 
 
 





History of Mining in Idaho
Mining has a long and storied history in Idaho. Today, major companies such as Monsanto Company (phosphate), Agrium Inc. (phosphate), Centerra Gold Inc. (molybdenum) and Hecla Mining (silver) are active in Idaho, following on a history that dates back to the 1860s. In the Fall of 1860, a party of ten prospectors led by Captain E.D. Pierce entered the Nez Perce Reservation in search of mineral wealth. After a month of frustration, one of the men, Wilbur Bassett, found what he’d been looking for - gold! Bassett’s discovery along Canal Gulch was far more significant than the Pierce party could have ever imagined. It was destined to set off one of the largest migrations in American history and it would change forever this part of the country that would become known as Idaho.
As a result of this find, mining became Idaho’s first industry. Even today, more than 150 years after the discovery of gold, mining remains a keystone of the Idaho economy. Mining in Idaho has shaped the state’s political boundaries, built cities and supplied the nation with minerals necessary for today’s modern lifestyle which many of us take for granted. The history of mining in Idaho is as colorful as the metal that first drew thousands of fortune seekers to the Gem State. It’s a history of golden dreams and silver linings.
Six months after Wilbur Bassett’s discovery of gold, 1600 claims had been staked along Canal Gulch, and Pierce City was growing by hundreds of fortune seekers a day. They came from Sacramento, San Francisco and Vancouver. Their migration up the Columbia and Snake Rivers caused Idaho to be one of only two states to be settled west to east. The Idaho gold rush also attracted merchants who set up a supply center at Lewiston. In 1863, the Idaho Territory was created and the tent city of Lewiston became the capital. As the gold along Canal Creek panned out, prospectors worked their way south and east to find rich gravel beds in the Salmon River country. Ten thousand miners poured into the Florence Basin in the summer of 1862, and, for a time, the district was producing over $600,000 worth of gold a day based on modern prices.
1862 also marked the discovery of the most significant gold mining district in Idaho, the Boise Basin. In the Boise Basin, it soon became obvious that a single miner working his claim alone with a pan or sluice box, was not profitable. Partnerships were then formed, ditches were dug and water from higher elevations was brought thundering into the basin with enough force to literally move mountains. By 1863, Idaho City had a population of 6,200 and surpassed Portland as the largest city in the Northwest. The Boise Basin was soon overcrowded. Latecomers, finding all the good ground taken, fanned out in all directions. One party found gold along Jordan Creek in the Owyhee Mountains. There, Silver City became a boom town. Unlike many placer mining districts, the millions of dollars invested in Owyhee underground mines and mills would assure Silver City a long, if sometimes turbulent, future. In 1863, Boise City was founded along the old Oregon Trail as a supply center for the Boise and Owyhee mining districts. Two years later Boise became the territorial capital.
New mining and processing technology was rapidly turning migrant prospecting camps into stable mining towns. Old water-powered crushing machines were replaced with steam-driven stamp mills. The air-powered drill replaced chisel and hammer. Mules began doing men’s work underground. Large smelters were built near lead-silver lode discoveries at Bayhorse and Clayton along the Salmon River. In 1882, 180,000 bushels of charcoal were produced in primitive kilns to operate the smelters.
A reverse migration northward began in 1881 when Andrew Prichard struck gold along the North Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River. The rush was further fueled by the Northern Pacific Railroad which plastered the country with handbills promising free gold in North Idaho for the price of a ticket on the railroad. But there was very little gold, free or otherwise, to be found. Like the Owyhee district, the true wealth of the Coeur d’Alene was silver, hidden deep in the ground. The most notable discovery of this mineral was made in 1885 when Noah Kellogg, or his donkey as he would often tell people, located the Bunker Hill Mine.
Ore had to be shipped out of the district for processing. In 1887 a narrow gauge railroad was completed from the mines to the old mission at Cataldo. Paddle wheel riverboats took the ore from Mission Landing downstream, across Lake Coeur d’Alene to the railhead at Rathdrum, making the Coeur d’Alene River the highest navigable river in the world.
By 1890, the Northern Pacific tracks stretched through the Silver Valley and snaked up Canyon Creek to the boom town of Burke. Burke gained world-wide attention in “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” as the town so narrow, merchants cranked their storefront awnings up for trains to pass. The Tiger Hotel straddled the tracks, and lodgers were regularly smoked out of their rooms when wood-burning locomotives passed underneath.
The fabulous Coeur d’Alene mining district has survived labor disputes, train wrecks, snow slides and politicians to become the richest proven silver mining district in the world. In 1985, the district mines produced their one billionth ounce of silver. In 2016, Hecla Mining sunk what is now the deepest shaft in the USA at the Lucky Friday Mine. The district has also produced vast amounts of lead, zinc, and copper. There are other impressive records in the Silver Valley. The Morning Star is one of the deepest mines in America. Bunker Hill ranks as America’s largest underground mine. And the Sunshine Mine was America’s richest silver mine, producing over 300 million ounces of silver, more than the entire output of Nevada’s famous Comstock Lode.
Phosphate mining has long been a major producer and important part of the Idaho economy. Phosphate mines located in the southeastern part of Idaho are operated by major multinationals including Agrium Corp, Monsanto and JR Simplot. In the molybdenum sector, Idaho’s Thompson Creek Mine (owned by Centerra Gold Inc.) is reportedly the largest open pit moly mine in the world (although it is currently on care and maintenance due to low moly prices).
In the gold sector, successful modern open pit, heap leach mining operations include the Beartrack Mine (operated by Meridian Gold and which produced over 600,000 ounces) and the Black Pine Mine (operated by Pegasus Gold and which produced over 450,000 ounces). As well, in the mid-1990s, the Kilgore Gold Project was to be Echo Bay Mines next open pit, heap leach production project but development was suspended due to low gold prices.
Interest in gold mining in Idaho has been increasing in recent years, with companies such as Midas Gold working diligently to restart the historic Stibnite Mine and Otis Gold working hard since 2008 to expand the Kilgore Gold Deposit. Additionally, Pilot Gold recently acquired the historic Black Pine Mine and is planning new drill campaigns at this past-producer.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Donald Trump is winning the currency cold war: Pimco

Overview
 
 
 




Otis Gold Corp. ("Otis" or the "Company") is focused on the discovery, exploration and development of gold deposits in Idaho. Otis’s management and technical team has a proven track record of discovering and developing quality assets and unlocking shareholder wealth through the drill bit and M&A activities.
Otis wholly owns a 100% ownership interest in gold and silver projects in Idaho, USA. Its flagship, the Kilgore Project (or "Kilgore"), is located in Clark County, Idaho. Kilgore is an advanced-stage open pit, heap leach low sulphidation epithermal gold deposit that contains a NI 43-101 compliant Indicated resource estimate of 520,000 oz Au @ 0.59 g/t and Inferred resource estimate of 300,000 oz Au @ 0.46 g/t that was prepared in 2012. Subsequent to the current resource estimate, approximately 15,000 metres of additional drilling has been completed that will be reflected in a new resource estimate. Additionally, significant potential exists to increase the size and grade of the deposit as well as discover additional targets within the 9,080 acre (36.7 km2) claim area. No royalties or other encumbrances exist at Kilgore.
Corporate Background
Otis Capital Corp. was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on April 24, 2007. On January 14, 2009, the Company changed its name to Otis Gold Corp. The Company's common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the "Exchange") under the trading symbol OOO. On July 16, 2008, the Company acquired an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Blue Hill Creek Project located in Cassia County, Idaho (which is now known as the Oakley Project). At the same time, the Company also acquired an option to earn up to a 75% interest in the Kilgore Gold Project, located in Clark County, Idaho, and the Hai and Gold Bug properties, located in Lemhi County, Idaho. In November 2010, the Company increased its interest in the Kilgore Gold Project and related assets to 100%. Further, in 2017, the Company completed a transaction that increased its ownership in the Oakley Project to 100%. The Company is currently exploring for minerals on these properties and other properties that it may acquire.
Corporate Vision
Otis is a gold exploration company focused on developing projects which have multi-million ounce potential located in mining-friendly jurisdictions. Otis is leveraging the talents of technical team, which made up the core of the Echo Bay Mines US exploration team in the mid 1990s, to build out its property portfolio. The technical team is complimented by a management team with a strong level of experience in corporate finance and public company management. While each project is approached with the goal of ultimately putting mines into production, the exit strategy will likely be through an M&A transaction.

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.

as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.





Will I have the option to act as my own Registered Agent?

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.
