We are publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "MRCC".  We are a specialty finance company focused on providing financing primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States and Canada. We provide customized financing solutions focused primarily on senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity, including equity co-investments in preferred and common stock and warrants. 
Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through investment in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured debt and equity investments. Unitranche debt is an instrument that combines both senior and junior secured debt into one facility. Unitranche debt is often used to finance leveraged buyouts. We intend to use our extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in primarily senior, unitranche and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. We believe that our primary focus on lending to lower middle-market companies offers several advantages as compared to lending to larger companies, including more attractive economics, lower leverage, direct access to borrower management and improved information flow. 
Our investment activities are managed by our investment advisor, Monroe Capital BDC Advisors, LLC (“MC Advisors”). MC Advisors is affiliated with Monroe Capital, LLC (“Monroe Capital”). Monroe Capital, founded in 2004, is a leading lender to middle-market companies with offices located in Chicago, New York, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Toronto.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
