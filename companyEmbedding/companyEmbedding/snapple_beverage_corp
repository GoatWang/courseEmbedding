History[edit]
Snapple was founded by Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden, and Arnold Greenberg in 1972 in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York.[1] Their company, which was originally known as Unadulterated Food Products, was first conceived as a part-time venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores.[2] Unsure if the business would succeed, Greenberg continued to run his health food store in Manhattan's East Village, while Leonard Marsh and his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, operated a window washing business.[2] In a 1989 interview with Crain's New York Business, Marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew "as much about juice as about making an atom bomb."[2]
Unadulterated Food Products was one of the first companies in the United States to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients.[2]
An early apple juice product led to the company's name, Snapple.[2] Golden, Greenberg and Marsh had created a carbonated apple juice.[2] Unfortunately, one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle, causing the bottle caps to fly off.[2] The original name of that particular apple juice product, "Snapple," which derived from the words "snappy" and "apple," became the new name for their beverage company, the Snapple Beverage Corporation, beginning in the early 1980s.[2][3] Snapple would not manufacture their first tea, lemon tea, until 1987.[4]
Currently, there are many different types of Snapple: Tea ( Multiple flavors along with original and diet), juice drinks, lemonade, and bottled water. Snapple is also bottled in the form of an aluminum can.[5]
Snapple's brand slogan is "Made from the Best Stuff on Earth."
Snapple was known for a popular series of TV advertisements in the early 1990s featuring Wendy Kaufman (the "Snapple Lady") answering letters from Snapple fans.[6] In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge commercials, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark “made from the best stuff on earth” line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products. By August 1992, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.[7]
The Quaker Oats Company bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994.[8] The company ran into problems and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.[9] Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000.[10] It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners.
Starting in May 2009, Snapple was made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. However, in certain areas, the older formula is still sold in stores, but this is becoming increasingly rare.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple in California. The suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present.[11]
In 2010, in a lawsuit against Snapple in the federal District of New Jersey, the court certified to the FDA for an administrative determination the question whether HFCS qualifies as a "natural" ingredient. In 2010, the FDA responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance. Stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation, the FDA again cited its limited resources and more pressing food-safety concerns.[12]
In 2011, a New York federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing Snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as "all natural." The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of Snapple's labeling.[13]
Snapple and New York City schools[edit]
In October 2003, Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system (and other parcels in the area), as part of the deal to make Snapple New York City's official beverage.[14] The company promised an $8 million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks, including juice and bottled water, in school vending machines.[14]
Snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because New York City officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas, which have been linked to childhood obesity, diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy. The Snapple juice drinks, specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools, are marketed under the "Snapple 100% Juiced!" label.[14] The flavors available under this brand include Green Apple, Fruit Punch, Melon Berry, Grape, Orange Mango, and Strawberry Lime.[14] Although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals, a 16-ounce bottle contains more sugar (41 grams) than a 12-ounce container of Coca-Cola (39 grams).[14]
Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the drinks "little better than vitamin-fortified sugar water."[14] In addition, the concentrates used in the drinks, apple, grape and pear, are the least expensive and nutritious. Dr. Toni Liquori, associate professor at the Columbia Teachers College, questioned the sale of bottled water in schools, saying "If anything, we should have cold water in our schools."[14]
The deal also gave Snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juice-based drinks in vending machines on all New York City properties starting in January 2004. Snapple paid the City $106 million for the rights and agreed to spend $60 million more to marketing and promotion over the length of the five-year contract.[15]
Rumors and myths[edit]
In the early 1990s the original label graphic on the Iced Tea flavor, a depiction of the United States historical event the Boston Tea Party, was replaced due to misinformation espoused by protest groups claiming the ships on the packaging were slave trading vessels in New York Harbor. Snapple also fell victim to a rumor that the small "K" was either a representation of the Klan, or of an imagined "Jewish Tax" (augmented by the fact that all three founders were Jewish). The "K" on the products actually meant that they were certified kosher.
Snapple initially tried to quell these rumors quietly, but ultimately had to launch a media campaign to squash them, pointing out it would be bad for business to support controversial issues in such a way as the rumors implied. Through a media campaign with the NAACP, Snapple successfully fought back these rumors, although occasionally they are still brought up as fact.[16][17]
"Real Facts"[edit]
Snapple is well known for printing interesting numbered "List of Snapple Real Fact facts" on the inside of their bottle caps. A list of these "Real Facts" are available on the company website.[18]




"Real Fact" #735. Each Snapple cap features a random factoid, some of which have been dismissed as misconceptions.[19]


Incorrect facts[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Several of the facts on Snapple caps have been found to be outdated, incorrect or exaggerated. Discredited "Real Facts" include:

#23 "The San Francisco cable cars are the only mobile national monument." The San Francisco Cable Cars as a group is a National Historic Landmark. National Monuments are a different designation. There are many ships that are National Historic Landmarks, as well as a few roller coasters.[20]
#31 "The average human will eat an average of eight spiders a year while asleep." This "statistic" was disseminated in 1993 as an example of the things people will believe simply because they come across them on the internet, as uncovered by Snopes.[21]
#36 "A duck's quack does not echo." Tested by Snopes and MythBusters. Both tests concluded that a duck's quack does echo but is hard to distinguish.[22]
#69 "Caller ID is illegal in California." There is no law against Caller ID in the state, though there were lengthy debates about making it illegal in the early 1990s.[23]
#77 "No piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times." This myth was proven wrong by Britney Gallivan in 2002 when she managed 12 folds. In 2005, drawing on Gallivan's accomplishment, MythBusters folded a piece of paper 11 times. The piece of paper used in Mythbusters was an oversized piece of paper that was thinner than a standard 8.5"x11" (21.59 x 27.94 cm) piece of paper.[24]
#89 "The average American walks 18,000 steps a day." Proven wrong, as the average American walks 5,117 steps a day.[25]
#114 "The oldest known animal was a tortoise, which lived to be 152 years old." A tortoise named Harriet once lived to be 175 years old[26] and the oldest known animal is Ming, a clam of the species arctica islandica, who lived to be 507 years old.[27]
#116 "The largest fish is the whale shark – it can be over 50 feet long and weigh 2 tons." Full-grown whale sharks do not weigh 2 tons (4,000 lbs or 1,820 kg), but are much heavier, weighing up to 16 tons (32,000 lbs or 14,550 kg).[28]
#140 "Holland is the only country with a national dog." Mexico also has a national dog (the Xoloitzcuintli).[29] Additionally, Holland is a region within the Netherlands, but is not technically a country in its own right[30] with the keeshond being the national dog of the Netherlands.[31]
#146 "The smallest county in America is New York County, better known as Manhattan."—Manhattan is actually the second-smallest county by land area after Kalawao County, Hawaii. Additionally, Arlington County, Virginia, the smallest self-governing county, is smaller in total area.
#162 "The temperature of the sun can reach up to 15 million degrees Fahrenheit." In fact, the core of the sun reaches 15 million degrees Celsius, about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.[32]
#163 "The first penny had the motto "Mind your own business."" The first official one-cent coin (known as a Fugio Cent) of the United States held the message "Mind Your Business" which, along with the image above it, formed a rebus meaning, time flies, do your work.
#744 "Polar bears can smell a seal from 20 miles away". According to Sea World, this distance is a much lower limit of about 1 km (0.6 miles).
#761 "Owls are one of the only birds that can see the color blue". In fact, birds have excellent color vision, with some being able to see even into the UV spectrum.
#769 "If a sheep and a goat mate the offspring is called a geep." A geep is produced by combining the embryos of a sheep and a goat. If they mate, the offspring is called a sheep-goat hybrid.
#793 "Broadway is one of the longest streets in the world. It is 150 miles long." Broadway terminates 32 miles (51.5 km) from its Manhattan origin. It continues north of Sleepy Hollow, New York as U.S. 9 and Albany Post Road.
#794 "Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the continental United States, and Zabriskien [sic] Point, the lowest point in the United States, are less than eighty miles apart." It is true that Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States, but Badwater Basin in Death Valley, (13 miles from Zabriskie Point) is the lowest point in the United States, at 282 feet below sea level, and is 84 miles from Mt. Whitney.[33]
#825 "Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing." The average newborn's eyeball is 16 to 18 millimeters in diameter (axial length). The infant's eyeball grows slightly to approximately 19.5 millimeters and by age 3 to 23mm. The eyeball continues to grow, gradually, to a diameter of about 24–25 millimeters in adulthood.[34]
#853 "Hawaii has its own time zone." Hawaii shares a time zone with the Aleutian Islands.
#868 "Thomas Jefferson invented the coat hanger." Claims that Thomas Jefferson invented the clothes hanger are unfounded according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello.[35]
#889 "The original Cinderella was Egyptian and wore fur slippers." It is true that Rhodopis is considered the oldest telling of the Cinderella story, but her slippers are consistently described as rose-gold. Some claim that Charles Perrault's classic French telling featured fur slippers, and that vair (fur) was mistranslated as verre (glass), but this is believed to be an urban legend.[36]
#904 "If done perfectly, any Rubik's Cube combination can be solved in 17 turns." In fact, it has been shown that there exists a starting position for Rubik's Cube that requires 20 turns to solve; furthermore 20 has also been proven to be the maximum number of moves required for solving from any initial scrambled state.[37]
#907 "Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors." There is no evidence supporting the claim that dueling is legal in Paraguay and it has been reported that the U.S. Paraguayan consulate also says it is not legal.[38]
#921 "If you had 1 billion dollars and spent 1 thousand dollars a day, it would take you 2,749 years to spend it all." If done correctly, simple math will show that it takes 2,738 years (counting leap years) to spend 1 billion dollars, not 2,749.
#975 "The letter J is the only letter in the alphabet that does not appear anywhere on the periodic table of the elements." This was true until 2012, when element 114 was officially renamed to Flerovium from its initial placeholder name ununquadium. Now both J and Q are missing from the periodic table.[39][40]

Popular culture[edit]




Snapple sponsors Marco Andretti's IndyCar during the 2015 season


Snapple was the official beverage sponsor of America's Got Talent from season 7 to season 9 of the NBC show.[41] (The show's new judge, Howard Stern, was a spokesperson for Snapple in the 1980s.)
Snapple was the primary sponsor of Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti during the 2014 IndyCar Series season and continues to be through the 2016 IndyCar season.
In an episode of the NBC comedy 30 Rock, Snapple product placement is inserted into the show with comedic effect.[42]
The comic series xkcd mentions Snapple in name only, making a joke out of its name in one strip by having someone offer an apple called "Snapple" to another person, who discovers that it is inedible because it is made out of tin, which is represented by the symbol "Sn" on the periodic table.[43][44]
Snapple was featured on the NBC comedy Seinfeld. Jerry and his pals, especially Elaine, were often heard offering a Snapple to guests as they stood near Jerry's open refrigerator.
Grand Puba ft. Mary J. Blige "Check it Out" (1992). Grand Puba raps "I drink a Snapple to wet my adam's apple" [45]
Snapple Theater Center[edit]
In 2007, Snapple opened the Snapple Theater Center on 50th Street and Broadway in the heart of New York City's Theater District. It has two theaters, one of which is a traditional theater, the other a thrust stage which can house plays. The center also includes a 40×50 ft rehearsal space which is available for rent. The theaters are considered Off-Broadway because of their low seating capacities.[46]
Kosher certification[edit]
Most Snapple drinks do have a Kosher certification from the OK Kosher Agency with some exceptions which include:

Fruit Punch[47]
Grape
Kiwi Lemon-lime

History[edit]
Snapple was founded by Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden, and Arnold Greenberg in 1972 in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York.[1] Their company, which was originally known as Unadulterated Food Products, was first conceived as a part-time venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores.[2] Unsure if the business would succeed, Greenberg continued to run his health food store in Manhattan's East Village, while Leonard Marsh and his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, operated a window washing business.[2] In a 1989 interview with Crain's New York Business, Marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew "as much about juice as about making an atom bomb."[2]
Unadulterated Food Products was one of the first companies in the United States to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients.[2]
An early apple juice product led to the company's name, Snapple.[2] Golden, Greenberg and Marsh had created a carbonated apple juice.[2] Unfortunately, one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle, causing the bottle caps to fly off.[2] The original name of that particular apple juice product, "Snapple," which derived from the words "snappy" and "apple," became the new name for their beverage company, the Snapple Beverage Corporation, beginning in the early 1980s.[2][3] Snapple would not manufacture their first tea, lemon tea, until 1987.[4]
Currently, there are many different types of Snapple: Tea ( Multiple flavors along with original and diet), juice drinks, lemonade, and bottled water. Snapple is also bottled in the form of an aluminum can.[5]
Snapple's brand slogan is "Made from the Best Stuff on Earth."
Snapple was known for a popular series of TV advertisements in the early 1990s featuring Wendy Kaufman (the "Snapple Lady") answering letters from Snapple fans.[6] In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge commercials, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark “made from the best stuff on earth” line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products. By August 1992, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.[7]
The Quaker Oats Company bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994.[8] The company ran into problems and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.[9] Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000.[10] It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners.
Starting in May 2009, Snapple was made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. However, in certain areas, the older formula is still sold in stores, but this is becoming increasingly rare.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple in California. The suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present.[11]
In 2010, in a lawsuit against Snapple in the federal District of New Jersey, the court certified to the FDA for an administrative determination the question whether HFCS qualifies as a "natural" ingredient. In 2010, the FDA responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance. Stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation, the FDA again cited its limited resources and more pressing food-safety concerns.[12]
In 2011, a New York federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing Snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as "all natural." The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of Snapple's labeling.[13]
Snapple and New York City schools[edit]
In October 2003, Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system (and other parcels in the area), as part of the deal to make Snapple New York City's official beverage.[14] The company promised an $8 million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks, including juice and bottled water, in school vending machines.[14]
Snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because New York City officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas, which have been linked to childhood obesity, diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy. The Snapple juice drinks, specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools, are marketed under the "Snapple 100% Juiced!" label.[14] The flavors available under this brand include Green Apple, Fruit Punch, Melon Berry, Grape, Orange Mango, and Strawberry Lime.[14] Although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals, a 16-ounce bottle contains more sugar (41 grams) than a 12-ounce container of Coca-Cola (39 grams).[14]
Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the drinks "little better than vitamin-fortified sugar water."[14] In addition, the concentrates used in the drinks, apple, grape and pear, are the least expensive and nutritious. Dr. Toni Liquori, associate professor at the Columbia Teachers College, questioned the sale of bottled water in schools, saying "If anything, we should have cold water in our schools."[14]
The deal also gave Snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juice-based drinks in vending machines on all New York City properties starting in January 2004. Snapple paid the City $106 million for the rights and agreed to spend $60 million more to marketing and promotion over the length of the five-year contract.[15]
Rumors and myths[edit]
In the early 1990s the original label graphic on the Iced Tea flavor, a depiction of the United States historical event the Boston Tea Party, was replaced due to misinformation espoused by protest groups claiming the ships on the packaging were slave trading vessels in New York Harbor. Snapple also fell victim to a rumor that the small "K" was either a representation of the Klan, or of an imagined "Jewish Tax" (augmented by the fact that all three founders were Jewish). The "K" on the products actually meant that they were certified kosher.
Snapple initially tried to quell these rumors quietly, but ultimately had to launch a media campaign to squash them, pointing out it would be bad for business to support controversial issues in such a way as the rumors implied. Through a media campaign with the NAACP, Snapple successfully fought back these rumors, although occasionally they are still brought up as fact.[16][17]
"Real Facts"[edit]
Snapple is well known for printing interesting numbered "List of Snapple Real Fact facts" on the inside of their bottle caps. A list of these "Real Facts" are available on the company website.[18]




"Real Fact" #735. Each Snapple cap features a random factoid, some of which have been dismissed as misconceptions.[19]


Incorrect facts[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Several of the facts on Snapple caps have been found to be outdated, incorrect or exaggerated. Discredited "Real Facts" include:

#23 "The San Francisco cable cars are the only mobile national monument." The San Francisco Cable Cars as a group is a National Historic Landmark. National Monuments are a different designation. There are many ships that are National Historic Landmarks, as well as a few roller coasters.[20]
#31 "The average human will eat an average of eight spiders a year while asleep." This "statistic" was disseminated in 1993 as an example of the things people will believe simply because they come across them on the internet, as uncovered by Snopes.[21]
#36 "A duck's quack does not echo." Tested by Snopes and MythBusters. Both tests concluded that a duck's quack does echo but is hard to distinguish.[22]
#69 "Caller ID is illegal in California." There is no law against Caller ID in the state, though there were lengthy debates about making it illegal in the early 1990s.[23]
#77 "No piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times." This myth was proven wrong by Britney Gallivan in 2002 when she managed 12 folds. In 2005, drawing on Gallivan's accomplishment, MythBusters folded a piece of paper 11 times. The piece of paper used in Mythbusters was an oversized piece of paper that was thinner than a standard 8.5"x11" (21.59 x 27.94 cm) piece of paper.[24]
#89 "The average American walks 18,000 steps a day." Proven wrong, as the average American walks 5,117 steps a day.[25]
#114 "The oldest known animal was a tortoise, which lived to be 152 years old." A tortoise named Harriet once lived to be 175 years old[26] and the oldest known animal is Ming, a clam of the species arctica islandica, who lived to be 507 years old.[27]
#116 "The largest fish is the whale shark – it can be over 50 feet long and weigh 2 tons." Full-grown whale sharks do not weigh 2 tons (4,000 lbs or 1,820 kg), but are much heavier, weighing up to 16 tons (32,000 lbs or 14,550 kg).[28]
#140 "Holland is the only country with a national dog." Mexico also has a national dog (the Xoloitzcuintli).[29] Additionally, Holland is a region within the Netherlands, but is not technically a country in its own right[30] with the keeshond being the national dog of the Netherlands.[31]
#146 "The smallest county in America is New York County, better known as Manhattan."—Manhattan is actually the second-smallest county by land area after Kalawao County, Hawaii. Additionally, Arlington County, Virginia, the smallest self-governing county, is smaller in total area.
#162 "The temperature of the sun can reach up to 15 million degrees Fahrenheit." In fact, the core of the sun reaches 15 million degrees Celsius, about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.[32]
#163 "The first penny had the motto "Mind your own business."" The first official one-cent coin (known as a Fugio Cent) of the United States held the message "Mind Your Business" which, along with the image above it, formed a rebus meaning, time flies, do your work.
#744 "Polar bears can smell a seal from 20 miles away". According to Sea World, this distance is a much lower limit of about 1 km (0.6 miles).
#761 "Owls are one of the only birds that can see the color blue". In fact, birds have excellent color vision, with some being able to see even into the UV spectrum.
#769 "If a sheep and a goat mate the offspring is called a geep." A geep is produced by combining the embryos of a sheep and a goat. If they mate, the offspring is called a sheep-goat hybrid.
#793 "Broadway is one of the longest streets in the world. It is 150 miles long." Broadway terminates 32 miles (51.5 km) from its Manhattan origin. It continues north of Sleepy Hollow, New York as U.S. 9 and Albany Post Road.
#794 "Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the continental United States, and Zabriskien [sic] Point, the lowest point in the United States, are less than eighty miles apart." It is true that Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States, but Badwater Basin in Death Valley, (13 miles from Zabriskie Point) is the lowest point in the United States, at 282 feet below sea level, and is 84 miles from Mt. Whitney.[33]
#825 "Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing." The average newborn's eyeball is 16 to 18 millimeters in diameter (axial length). The infant's eyeball grows slightly to approximately 19.5 millimeters and by age 3 to 23mm. The eyeball continues to grow, gradually, to a diameter of about 24–25 millimeters in adulthood.[34]
#853 "Hawaii has its own time zone." Hawaii shares a time zone with the Aleutian Islands.
#868 "Thomas Jefferson invented the coat hanger." Claims that Thomas Jefferson invented the clothes hanger are unfounded according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello.[35]
#889 "The original Cinderella was Egyptian and wore fur slippers." It is true that Rhodopis is considered the oldest telling of the Cinderella story, but her slippers are consistently described as rose-gold. Some claim that Charles Perrault's classic French telling featured fur slippers, and that vair (fur) was mistranslated as verre (glass), but this is believed to be an urban legend.[36]
#904 "If done perfectly, any Rubik's Cube combination can be solved in 17 turns." In fact, it has been shown that there exists a starting position for Rubik's Cube that requires 20 turns to solve; furthermore 20 has also been proven to be the maximum number of moves required for solving from any initial scrambled state.[37]
#907 "Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors." There is no evidence supporting the claim that dueling is legal in Paraguay and it has been reported that the U.S. Paraguayan consulate also says it is not legal.[38]
#921 "If you had 1 billion dollars and spent 1 thousand dollars a day, it would take you 2,749 years to spend it all." If done correctly, simple math will show that it takes 2,738 years (counting leap years) to spend 1 billion dollars, not 2,749.
#975 "The letter J is the only letter in the alphabet that does not appear anywhere on the periodic table of the elements." This was true until 2012, when element 114 was officially renamed to Flerovium from its initial placeholder name ununquadium. Now both J and Q are missing from the periodic table.[39][40]

Popular culture[edit]




Snapple sponsors Marco Andretti's IndyCar during the 2015 season


Snapple was the official beverage sponsor of America's Got Talent from season 7 to season 9 of the NBC show.[41] (The show's new judge, Howard Stern, was a spokesperson for Snapple in the 1980s.)
Snapple was the primary sponsor of Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti during the 2014 IndyCar Series season and continues to be through the 2016 IndyCar season.
In an episode of the NBC comedy 30 Rock, Snapple product placement is inserted into the show with comedic effect.[42]
The comic series xkcd mentions Snapple in name only, making a joke out of its name in one strip by having someone offer an apple called "Snapple" to another person, who discovers that it is inedible because it is made out of tin, which is represented by the symbol "Sn" on the periodic table.[43][44]
Snapple was featured on the NBC comedy Seinfeld. Jerry and his pals, especially Elaine, were often heard offering a Snapple to guests as they stood near Jerry's open refrigerator.
Grand Puba ft. Mary J. Blige "Check it Out" (1992). Grand Puba raps "I drink a Snapple to wet my adam's apple" [45]
Snapple Theater Center[edit]
In 2007, Snapple opened the Snapple Theater Center on 50th Street and Broadway in the heart of New York City's Theater District. It has two theaters, one of which is a traditional theater, the other a thrust stage which can house plays. The center also includes a 40×50 ft rehearsal space which is available for rent. The theaters are considered Off-Broadway because of their low seating capacities.[46]
Kosher certification[edit]
Most Snapple drinks do have a Kosher certification from the OK Kosher Agency with some exceptions which include:

Fruit Punch[47]
Grape
Kiwi Lemon-lime

History of Snapple Beverage Corporation








The Snapple Beverage Corporation is the leading American retailer of single-serving iced tea drinks and the second largest seller of fruit drinks. Started as a part-time business in the natural foods industry during the 1970s, Snapple grew dramatically after it introduced a new, better-tasting iced tea product in the late 1980s. Its subsequent explosion in growth, in which sales more than doubled every year, came as the American soft drink market shifted away from carbonated beverages toward a wider variety of noncarbonated drinks and fruit juices. This industrywide movement was fueled in part by Snapple's introduction of healthy, all natural products.
Snapple was founded in 1972 by Arnold Greenberg, Leonard Marsh, and Hyman Golden. Greenberg operated a health food store on the lower east side of Manhattan. His boyhood friend Marsh ran a window-washing service with his brother-in-law, Golden. In the early 1970s, the three founded Unadulterated Food Products, Inc., to sell pure fruit juices in unusual blends to health food stores. Products were bottled at a small plant in the New York metropolitan area. The partners ran the business in their spare time while all three kept their regular jobs, and the enterprise plodded along until the late 1970s.
In 1978, Unadulterated Foods began to market carbonated apple juice. The company called the product "Snapple," after purchasing the name for $500. In the first month of its introduction, Unadulterated sold 500 cases of apple juice. In the second month, the company sold another 500 cases of Snapple, and distributors started calling to request the product. When tops starting popping off bottles in the warehouse, Unadulterated realized that the growing popularity of Snapple might be related to the fact that the juice was fermenting.
Outside of this brief and unintended foray into the alcoholic beverage industry, however, Unadulterated's legitimate business had begun to grow. In 1979, the company hired its first salesman and began seeking out franchised distributors. "One day we woke up. We realized we had a business," Marsh later told Newsday. The partners began to step up their efforts. In 1980, Unadulterated expanded the Snapple line to include other all natural juices. In 1982, it added natural sodas. Despite their relatively high price of $1 a bottle, these products enjoyed some success in the New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., areas in the early 1980s. The company's three founders spent much of their time thinking up new flavors and names for their drinks. Each new variety of Snapple took from six months to a year to develop, as alterations were made in taste, color, and name. The company strove for memorable names that were not too gimmicky, rejecting, for instance, "guava nagilah."
As a result of these efforts, in 1986 Snapple expanded its line to include fruit drinks. It was not until the following year, however, when the partners decided that Snapple needed a summertime drink, that the company hit upon the product that would allow its growth to take off: iced tea. In the past, iced teas had been manufactured in the same way that other drinks were, with flavor, derived from a concentrate, sugar, preservatives and soda. Unadulterated, however, spent three years working with a tea vendor and a bottler to perfect a method in which tea was bottled while hot, which allowed the preservatives to be eliminated. "We made the first ready-to-drink tea that didn't taste like battery acid," Greenberg later told the New York Times. "We came up with the first real brewed tea that was cooked."
In 1988, Snapple introduced a lemon-flavored iced tea made with the new process. This product proved to be so popular that its sales continued even after the hot weather was gone. "It blew everyone away," Marsh explained to Newsday. Driven by the popularity of the new iced tea product, which was soon supplemented by other flavors of tea, Snapple sales took off. By the end of 1988, Unadulterated's sales had increased by 60 percent over the previous 12 months, to $13.3 million. This strong growth continued in the following year. Unadulterated expanded the Snapple line to include 53 different flavors, and, in the first six months of 1989, the company's revenues from noncarbonated beverages increased by 600 percent.
By that fall, Snapple was unable to fulfill all the demand for its iced tea products, and the company had instituted an allocation system to distribute its drinks. Only after Unadulterated had contracted with a second bottling plant in upstate New York did it begin to catch up with demand. At the end of the year, total company sales had nearly doubled from the year before.
In 1990, Snapple built on these dramatic gains by introducing Snap-Up, its entrant in the isotonic sports drink market, which was rolled out in four flavors. In addition, in an effort to break out of the single-serving market, Snapple introduced a 32-ounce bottle of its beverages, to be sold in grocery stores and taken home. As sales of its flavored teas doubled over the course of 1990, Snapple became the market leader for this category in the New York area. In an effort to enhance that position, the company launched a $2 million advertising campaign featuring tennis star Ivan Lendl. The company hoped that Lendl's active and physically fit image would appeal to consumers of its all-natural products.
In 1991, Unadulterated moved its headquarters from Brooklyn to Long Island, where its three founders had long lived. With strong returns from flavors such as mint, cranberry, and decaffeinated iced teas, Snapple's revenues more than doubled to $95 million, with 55 percent of its sales in iced teas as the market for this product grew to $400 million. The company had attained a solid second place in this field with 19.3 percent of sales, behind long-time market leader Lipton, with 37.2 percent of the market, as it expanded its market beyond the East Coast, introducing Snapple products in California.
In order to expand its geographic reach further, Snapple needed an infusion of capital. Although the company had looked for a corporate partner for several years, its three founding partners were unwilling to relinquish control of Unadulterated, and they wished to keep all of the company's operations intact, rather than shedding the less successful non-iced-tea product lines. Finally, Snapple reached an agreement with a Boston-based investment banking firm, the Thomas H. Lee Company. In January 1992, Lee formed the Snapple Holding Corporation in Delaware. Then in April, the founders of Unadulterated, Marsh, Golden, and Greenberg, sold 70 percent of Unadulterated to this company for $45 million. In doing so, they received guarantees that they would remain in charge of the firm and that salaries of $300,000 a year would be paid to each of them through 1996, along with several multimillion dollar bonus payments at the time of the sale of stock.








With this deal, Snapple gained the resources to pay for nationwide distribution of its products. In addition, the company geared up for major competition from the leaders of the soft drink industry, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. Taking notice of the explosive growth of the iced tea industry, Coke had teamed up with Lipton, and Pepsi with Nestea to market their own iced tea products, and industry observers predicted that their entry into the market in full force in the summer of 1992 would bury upstart Snapple.
In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark "made from the best stuff on earth" line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products.
Despite the competitive threat from Coke and Nestea, which released its product in February 1992, Snapple's market share continued to grow. In the first six months of 1992, the company sold nearly as much product as it had sold in all of the previous year. In an effort to expand its reputation for high-quality teas to its sports drink line, Snapple introduced tea-flavored Snap-Up, in August 1992.
With its infusion of new capital, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States by August 1992, and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.
In addition to its efforts to expand domestic distribution, Snapple also began a push to sell its products in foreign markets in 1992. As a first step in this effort, the company began distributing its drinks to American military bases around the world. By the fall of that year, these moves had started to show fruit, as Snapple pulled ahead of Nestea to become the leader in the ready-to-drink iced tea market, earning 30 percent of all sales for the first eight months of the year.
With these strong results, Snapple announced that it would sell stock to the public for the first time in December 1992. In preparation for the stock offering, Snapple Holding merged into its subsidiary, becoming the Snapple Beverage Corporation. In the initial offering, 17 percent of Snapple's stock was offered to investors, with the bulk of the proceeds going to pay off debts incurred when the company was first purchased from its founders. On December 15, the stock was first offered, at $20 a share. The offering was an immediate hit, as the four million shares were snapped up, and the company's stock price was driven to $33. These results were reinforced at the end of the year, when the company posted annual revenues for 1992 of $231.9 million, more than double the previous year's tally. Within six months, Snapple stock had been split twice, as revenues continued to grow, and the company's founders had sold another eight percent of their holdings to take advantage of the bull market in the company's shares.
With the introduction of Lipton Original ready-to-drink tea in the late spring of 1993, however, Snapple faced a new and aggressive competitor. The company tripled its advertising budget and unveiled a new campaign in an effort to maintain its standing in the market. As Lipton ran radio ads charging that Snapple's product was made from reconstituted tea powder, it briefly passed Snapple in market share during the key summer months, before becoming unable to meet demand. By the fall however, Snapple had regained the lead in sales in larger supermarkets, earning a 39.4 percent share.
In addition to the threat from Lipton, Snapple's franchise as a health food purveyor was threatened when the U.S. Food & Drug Administration began to question the use of the words "all natural" on some company labels, and California regulators became suspicious of the designation "brewed" on the company's teas. In addition, Snapple confronted a bizarre series of rumors concerning its products. One tale had it that the company supported the Ku Klux Klan, perhaps because a small "K" on its labels indicated that its products were kosher, or because the background picture on its iced tea bottles, depicting the Boston Tea Party, with masked raiders in boats, had been misinterpreted. Another swift-moving rumor alleged that Snapple supported the extreme anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Company officials guessed that the source of this misinformation was the product's long-time advertisements on the Rush Limbaugh show.
Despite these worries, Snapple's sales continued to boom. The company finished 1993 with sales up 119 percent from the previous year, as the company moved 55.6 million cases of beverage. This marked the third year in a row in which sales of Snapple drinks had more than doubled. One half of the company's revenues were still contributed by iced teas, with the remaining portion made up by its 10 flavors of fruit drinks (45 percent) and its 23 flavors of natural soda, fruit juices, and Snapple Sport drink.
These gains continued in the first quarter of 1994, as Snapple reported three-month sales that had doubled from the year before. In order to strengthen its market share, Snapple embarked on a program in 1994 to expand its product offerings and to shore up its distribution system. In April, the company rolled out eight new flavors, including Mango Tea, three new sodas, and four new fruit drinks, including diet versions of popular offerings, such as Pink Lemonade. The company also introduced a larger, 15.5 ounce can. With these steps, Snapple hoped to shore up its fruit juice category, which Coca-Cola had recently entered with a line of "Fruitopia" drinks.
In order to display its products more effectively, Snapple unveiled a new glass-fronted vending machine, which showed 54 different beverages at once. The company rolled out 1000 of these to begin with, with plans to add 9,000 more in locations across the country. Snapple believed that the glass front of the machine encouraged impulse buying.
Snapple took steps to gain greater control over its domestic distribution in June 1994. At that time, the company purchased two of its long-time distributors, Groux Beverage Corporation, of Orange County, California, and Trinity Beverage Corporation, based in Texas. In addition, Snapple purchased a half interest in the Haralambos Beverage Corporation, based in Los Angeles. With these investments, Snapple was able to increase its percentage of direct distribution, in which wholesalers sold and delivered Snapple products directly to stores, rather than to other middlemen who ran warehouses. In this way, the company hoped to gain greater control over its retail presentation and to get more shelf space, as distributors themselves actually stocked the shelves.
By the start of the summer of 1994, Snapple had moved to a new headquarters building and increased its staff to 230 people. In an effort to maintain the superior quality that it believed would support its market share, Snapple increased the size of its quality-control department rapidly. The company contracted with 28 bottlers in the United States and 2 in Canada to produce its beverages. Earlier that spring, Snapple had also expanded its international distribution to Japan. Previously, sales had begun in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Greece, Norway, and Hong Kong. The company looked to Australia, Singapore, and the Phillipines for further expansion late in 1994.
By July 1994, Snapple had solidified its position as the fastest growing beverage company in the world and the second largest seller of single-serving juices, growing steadily larger in a market that continued to rapidly expand. Although the company faced significant threats from large and powerful competitors, its record of introducing popular new products boded well for its future success.

Principal Subsidiaries: Trinity Beverage Company; Groux Beverage Company; Haralambus Beverage Company (50%).

History[edit]
Snapple was founded by Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden, and Arnold Greenberg in 1972 in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York.[1] Their company, which was originally known as Unadulterated Food Products, was first conceived as a part-time venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores.[2] Unsure if the business would succeed, Greenberg continued to run his health food store in Manhattan's East Village, while Leonard Marsh and his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, operated a window washing business.[2] In a 1989 interview with Crain's New York Business, Marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew "as much about juice as about making an atom bomb."[2]
Unadulterated Food Products was one of the first companies in the United States to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients.[2]
An early apple juice product led to the company's name, Snapple.[2] Golden, Greenberg and Marsh had created a carbonated apple juice.[2] Unfortunately, one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle, causing the bottle caps to fly off.[2] The original name of that particular apple juice product, "Snapple," which derived from the words "snappy" and "apple," became the new name for their beverage company, the Snapple Beverage Corporation, beginning in the early 1980s.[2][3] Snapple would not manufacture their first tea, lemon tea, until 1987.[4]
Currently, there are many different types of Snapple: Tea ( Multiple flavors along with original and diet), juice drinks, lemonade, and bottled water. Snapple is also bottled in the form of an aluminum can.[5]
Snapple's brand slogan is "Made from the Best Stuff on Earth."
Snapple was known for a popular series of TV advertisements in the early 1990s featuring Wendy Kaufman (the "Snapple Lady") answering letters from Snapple fans.[6] In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge commercials, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark “made from the best stuff on earth” line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products. By August 1992, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.[7]
The Quaker Oats Company bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994.[8] The company ran into problems and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.[9] Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000.[10] It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners.
Starting in May 2009, Snapple was made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. However, in certain areas, the older formula is still sold in stores, but this is becoming increasingly rare.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple in California. The suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present.[11]
In 2010, in a lawsuit against Snapple in the federal District of New Jersey, the court certified to the FDA for an administrative determination the question whether HFCS qualifies as a "natural" ingredient. In 2010, the FDA responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance. Stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation, the FDA again cited its limited resources and more pressing food-safety concerns.[12]
In 2011, a New York federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing Snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as "all natural." The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of Snapple's labeling.[13]
Snapple and New York City schools[edit]
In October 2003, Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system (and other parcels in the area), as part of the deal to make Snapple New York City's official beverage.[14] The company promised an $8 million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks, including juice and bottled water, in school vending machines.[14]
Snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because New York City officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas, which have been linked to childhood obesity, diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy. The Snapple juice drinks, specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools, are marketed under the "Snapple 100% Juiced!" label.[14] The flavors available under this brand include Green Apple, Fruit Punch, Melon Berry, Grape, Orange Mango, and Strawberry Lime.[14] Although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals, a 16-ounce bottle contains more sugar (41 grams) than a 12-ounce container of Coca-Cola (39 grams).[14]
Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the drinks "little better than vitamin-fortified sugar water."[14] In addition, the concentrates used in the drinks, apple, grape and pear, are the least expensive and nutritious. Dr. Toni Liquori, associate professor at the Columbia Teachers College, questioned the sale of bottled water in schools, saying "If anything, we should have cold water in our schools."[14]
The deal also gave Snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juice-based drinks in vending machines on all New York City properties starting in January 2004. Snapple paid the City $106 million for the rights and agreed to spend $60 million more to marketing and promotion over the length of the five-year contract.[15]
Rumors and myths[edit]
In the early 1990s the original label graphic on the Iced Tea flavor, a depiction of the United States historical event the Boston Tea Party, was replaced due to misinformation espoused by protest groups claiming the ships on the packaging were slave trading vessels in New York Harbor. Snapple also fell victim to a rumor that the small "K" was either a representation of the Klan, or of an imagined "Jewish Tax" (augmented by the fact that all three founders were Jewish). The "K" on the products actually meant that they were certified kosher.
Snapple initially tried to quell these rumors quietly, but ultimately had to launch a media campaign to squash them, pointing out it would be bad for business to support controversial issues in such a way as the rumors implied. Through a media campaign with the NAACP, Snapple successfully fought back these rumors, although occasionally they are still brought up as fact.[16][17]
"Real Facts"[edit]
Snapple is well known for printing interesting numbered "List of Snapple Real Fact facts" on the inside of their bottle caps. A list of these "Real Facts" are available on the company website.[18]




"Real Fact" #735. Each Snapple cap features a random factoid, some of which have been dismissed as misconceptions.[19]


Incorrect facts[edit]

Several of the facts on Snapple caps have been found to be outdated, incorrect or exaggerated. Discredited "Real Facts" include:

#23 "The San Francisco cable cars are the only mobile national monument." The San Francisco Cable Cars as a group is a National Historic Landmark. National Monuments are a different designation. There are many ships that are National Historic Landmarks, as well as a few roller coasters.[20]
#31 "The average human will eat an average of eight spiders a year while asleep." This "statistic" was disseminated in 1993 as an example of the things people will believe simply because they come across them on the internet, as uncovered by Snopes.[21]
#36 "A duck's quack does not echo." Tested by Snopes and MythBusters. Both tests concluded that a duck's quack does echo but is hard to distinguish.[22]
#69 "Caller ID is illegal in California." There is no law against Caller ID in the state, though there were lengthy debates about making it illegal in the early 1990s.[23]
#77 "No piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times." This myth was proven wrong by Britney Gallivan in 2002 when she managed 12 folds. In 2005, drawing on Gallivan's accomplishment, MythBusters folded a piece of paper 11 times. The piece of paper used in Mythbusters was an oversized piece of paper that was thinner than a standard 8.5"x11" (21.59 x 27.94 cm) piece of paper.[24]
#89 "The average American walks 18,000 steps a day." Proven wrong, as the average American walks 5,117 steps a day.[25]
#114 "The oldest known animal was a tortoise, which lived to be 152 years old." A tortoise named Harriet once lived to be 175 years old[26] and the oldest known animal is Ming, a clam of the species arctica islandica, who lived to be 507 years old.[27]
#116 "The largest fish is the whale shark – it can be over 50 feet long and weigh 2 tons." Full-grown whale sharks do not weigh 2 tons (4,000 lbs or 1,820 kg), but are much heavier, weighing up to 16 tons (32,000 lbs or 14,550 kg).[28]
#140 "Holland is the only country with a national dog." Mexico also has a national dog (the Xoloitzcuintli).[29] Additionally, Holland is a region within the Netherlands, but is not technically a country in its own right[30] with the keeshond being the national dog of the Netherlands.[31]
#146 "The smallest county in America is New York County, better known as Manhattan."—Manhattan is actually the second-smallest county by land area after Kalawao County, Hawaii. Additionally, Arlington County, Virginia, the smallest self-governing county, is smaller in total area.
#162 "The temperature of the sun can reach up to 15 million degrees Fahrenheit." In fact, the core of the sun reaches 15 million degrees Celsius, about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.[32]
#163 "The first penny had the motto "Mind your own business."" The first official one-cent coin (known as a Fugio Cent) of the United States held the message "Mind Your Business" which, along with the image above it, formed a rebus meaning, time flies, do your work.
#744 "Polar bears can smell a seal from 20 miles away". According to Sea World, this distance is a much lower limit of about 1 km (0.6 miles).
#761 "Owls are one of the only birds that can see the color blue". In fact, birds have excellent color vision, with some being able to see even into the UV spectrum.
#769 "If a sheep and a goat mate the offspring is called a geep." A geep is produced by combining the embryos of a sheep and a goat. If they mate, the offspring is called a sheep-goat hybrid.
#793 "Broadway is one of the longest streets in the world. It is 150 miles long." Broadway terminates 32 miles (51.5 km) from its Manhattan origin. It continues north of Sleepy Hollow, New York as U.S. 9 and Albany Post Road.
#794 "Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the continental United States, and Zabriskien [sic] Point, the lowest point in the United States, are less than eighty miles apart." It is true that Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States, but Badwater Basin in Death Valley, (13 miles from Zabriskie Point) is the lowest point in the United States, at 282 feet below sea level, and is 84 miles from Mt. Whitney.[33]
#825 "Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing." The average newborn's eyeball is 16 to 18 millimeters in diameter (axial length). The infant's eyeball grows slightly to approximately 19.5 millimeters and by age 3 to 23mm. The eyeball continues to grow, gradually, to a diameter of about 24–25 millimeters in adulthood.[34]
#853 "Hawaii has its own time zone." Hawaii shares a time zone with the Aleutian Islands.
#868 "Thomas Jefferson invented the coat hanger." Claims that Thomas Jefferson invented the clothes hanger are unfounded according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello.[35]
#889 "The original Cinderella was Egyptian and wore fur slippers." It is true that Rhodopis is considered the oldest telling of the Cinderella story, but her slippers are consistently described as rose-gold. Some claim that Charles Perrault's classic French telling featured fur slippers, and that vair (fur) was mistranslated as verre (glass), but this is believed to be an urban legend.[36]
#904 "If done perfectly, any Rubik's Cube combination can be solved in 17 turns." In fact, it has been shown that there exists a starting position for Rubik's Cube that requires 20 turns to solve; furthermore 20 has also been proven to be the maximum number of moves required for solving from any initial scrambled state.[37]
#907 "Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors." There is no evidence supporting the claim that dueling is legal in Paraguay and it has been reported that the U.S. Paraguayan consulate also says it is not legal.[38]
#921 "If you had 1 billion dollars and spent 1 thousand dollars a day, it would take you 2,749 years to spend it all." If done correctly, simple math will show that it takes 2,738 years (counting leap years) to spend 1 billion dollars, not 2,749.
#975 "The letter J is the only letter in the alphabet that does not appear anywhere on the periodic table of the elements." This was true until 2012, when element 114 was officially renamed to Flerovium from its initial placeholder name ununquadium. Now both J and Q are missing from the periodic table.[39][40]

Popular culture[edit]




Snapple sponsors Marco Andretti's IndyCar during the 2015 season


Snapple was the official beverage sponsor of America's Got Talent from season 7 to season 9 of the NBC show.[41] (The show's new judge, Howard Stern, was a spokesperson for Snapple in the 1980s.)
Snapple was the primary sponsor of Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti during the 2014 IndyCar Series season and continues to be through the 2016 IndyCar season.
In an episode of the NBC comedy 30 Rock, Snapple product placement is inserted into the show with comedic effect.[42]
The comic series xkcd mentions Snapple in name only, making a joke out of its name in one strip by having someone offer an apple called "Snapple" to another person, who discovers that it is inedible because it is made out of tin, which is represented by the symbol "Sn" on the periodic table.[43][44]
Snapple was featured on the NBC comedy Seinfeld. Jerry and his pals, especially Elaine, were often heard offering a Snapple to guests as they stood near Jerry's open refrigerator.
Grand Puba ft. Mary J. Blige "Check it Out" (1992). Grand Puba raps "I drink a Snapple to wet my adam's apple" [45]
Snapple Theater Center[edit]
In 2007, Snapple opened the Snapple Theater Center on 50th Street and Broadway in the heart of New York City's Theater District. It has two theaters, one of which is a traditional theater, the other a thrust stage which can house plays. The center also includes a 40×50 ft rehearsal space which is available for rent. The theaters are considered Off-Broadway because of their low seating capacities.[46]
Kosher certification[edit]
Most Snapple drinks do have a Kosher certification from the OK Kosher Agency with some exceptions which include:

Fruit Punch[47]
Grape
Kiwi Lemon-lime

History[edit]
Snapple was founded by Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden, and Arnold Greenberg in 1972 in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York.[1] Their company, which was originally known as Unadulterated Food Products, was first conceived as a part-time venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores.[2] Unsure if the business would succeed, Greenberg continued to run his health food store in Manhattan's East Village, while Leonard Marsh and his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, operated a window washing business.[2] In a 1989 interview with Crain's New York Business, Marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew "as much about juice as about making an atom bomb."[2]
Unadulterated Food Products was one of the first companies in the United States to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients.[2]
An early apple juice product led to the company's name, Snapple.[2] Golden, Greenberg and Marsh had created a carbonated apple juice.[2] Unfortunately, one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle, causing the bottle caps to fly off.[2] The original name of that particular apple juice product, "Snapple," which derived from the words "snappy" and "apple," became the new name for their beverage company, the Snapple Beverage Corporation, beginning in the early 1980s.[2][3] Snapple would not manufacture their first tea, lemon tea, until 1987.[4]
Currently, there are many different types of Snapple: Tea ( Multiple flavors along with original and diet), juice drinks, lemonade, and bottled water. Snapple is also bottled in the form of an aluminum can.[5]
Snapple's brand slogan is "Made from the Best Stuff on Earth."
Snapple was known for a popular series of TV advertisements in the early 1990s featuring Wendy Kaufman (the "Snapple Lady") answering letters from Snapple fans.[6] In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge commercials, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark “made from the best stuff on earth” line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products. By August 1992, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.[7]
The Quaker Oats Company bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994.[8] The company ran into problems and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.[9] Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000.[10] It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners.
Starting in May 2009, Snapple was made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. However, in certain areas, the older formula is still sold in stores, but this is becoming increasingly rare.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple in California. The suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present.[11]
In 2010, in a lawsuit against Snapple in the federal District of New Jersey, the court certified to the FDA for an administrative determination the question whether HFCS qualifies as a "natural" ingredient. In 2010, the FDA responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance. Stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation, the FDA again cited its limited resources and more pressing food-safety concerns.[12]
In 2011, a New York federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing Snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as "all natural." The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of Snapple's labeling.[13]
Snapple and New York City schools[edit]
In October 2003, Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system (and other parcels in the area), as part of the deal to make Snapple New York City's official beverage.[14] The company promised an $8 million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks, including juice and bottled water, in school vending machines.[14]
Snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because New York City officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas, which have been linked to childhood obesity, diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy. The Snapple juice drinks, specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools, are marketed under the "Snapple 100% Juiced!" label.[14] The flavors available under this brand include Green Apple, Fruit Punch, Melon Berry, Grape, Orange Mango, and Strawberry Lime.[14] Although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals, a 16-ounce bottle contains more sugar (41 grams) than a 12-ounce container of Coca-Cola (39 grams).[14]
Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the drinks "little better than vitamin-fortified sugar water."[14] In addition, the concentrates used in the drinks, apple, grape and pear, are the least expensive and nutritious. Dr. Toni Liquori, associate professor at the Columbia Teachers College, questioned the sale of bottled water in schools, saying "If anything, we should have cold water in our schools."[14]
The deal also gave Snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juice-based drinks in vending machines on all New York City properties starting in January 2004. Snapple paid the City $106 million for the rights and agreed to spend $60 million more to marketing and promotion over the length of the five-year contract.[15]
Rumors and myths[edit]
In the early 1990s the original label graphic on the Iced Tea flavor, a depiction of the United States historical event the Boston Tea Party, was replaced due to misinformation espoused by protest groups claiming the ships on the packaging were slave trading vessels in New York Harbor. Snapple also fell victim to a rumor that the small "K" was either a representation of the Klan, or of an imagined "Jewish Tax" (augmented by the fact that all three founders were Jewish). The "K" on the products actually meant that they were certified kosher.
Snapple initially tried to quell these rumors quietly, but ultimately had to launch a media campaign to squash them, pointing out it would be bad for business to support controversial issues in such a way as the rumors implied. Through a media campaign with the NAACP, Snapple successfully fought back these rumors, although occasionally they are still brought up as fact.[16][17]
"Real Facts"[edit]
Snapple is well known for printing interesting numbered "List of Snapple Real Fact facts" on the inside of their bottle caps. A list of these "Real Facts" are available on the company website.[18]




"Real Fact" #735. Each Snapple cap features a random factoid, some of which have been dismissed as misconceptions.[19]

#907 "Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors." There is no evidence supporting the claim that dueling is legal in Paraguay and it has been reported that the U.S. Paraguayan consulate also says it is not legal.[38]
#921 "If you had 1 billion dollars and spent 1 thousand dollars a day, it would take you 2,749 years to spend it all." If done correctly, simple math will show that it takes 2,738 years (counting leap years) to spend 1 billion dollars, not 2,749.
#975 "The letter J is the only letter in the alphabet that does not appear anywhere on the periodic table of the elements." This was true until 2012, when element 114 was officially renamed to Flerovium from its initial placeholder name ununquadium. Now both J and Q are missing from the periodic table.[39][40]

Snapple sponsors Marco Andretti's IndyCar during the 2015 season


Snapple was the official beverage sponsor of America's Got Talent from season 7 to season 9 of the NBC show.[41] (The show's new judge, Howard Stern, was a spokesperson for Snapple in the 1980s.)
Snapple was the primary sponsor of Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti during the 2014 IndyCar Series season and continues to be through the 2016 IndyCar season.
In an episode of the NBC comedy 30 Rock, Snapple product placement is inserted into the show with comedic effect.[42]
The comic series xkcd mentions Snapple in name only, making a joke out of its name in one strip by having someone offer an apple called "Snapple" to another person, who discovers that it is inedible because it is made out of tin, which is represented by the symbol "Sn" on the periodic table.[43][44]
Snapple was featured on the NBC comedy Seinfeld. Jerry and his pals, especially Elaine, were often heard offering a Snapple to guests as they stood near Jerry's open refrigerator.

Snapple Theater Center[edit]
In 2007, Snapple opened the Snapple Theater Center on 50th Street and Broadway in the heart of New York City's Theater District. It has two theaters, one of which is a traditional theater, the other a thrust stage which can house plays. The center also includes a 40×50 ft rehearsal space which is available for rent. The theaters are considered Off-Broadway because of their low seating capacities.[46]

History[edit]
Snapple was founded by Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden, and Arnold Greenberg in 1972 in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York.[1] Their company, which was originally known as Unadulterated Food Products, was first conceived as a part-time venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores.[2] Unsure if the business would succeed, Greenberg continued to run his health food store in Manhattan's East Village, while Leonard Marsh and his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, operated a window washing business.[2] In a 1989 interview with Crain's New York Business, Marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew "as much about juice as about making an atom bomb."[2]
Unadulterated Food Products was one of the first companies in the United States to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients.[2]
An early apple juice product led to the company's name, Snapple.[2] Golden, Greenberg and Marsh had created a carbonated apple juice.[2] Unfortunately, one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle, causing the bottle caps to fly off.[2] The original name of that particular apple juice product, "Snapple," which derived from the words "snappy" and "apple," became the new name for their beverage company, the Snapple Beverage Corporation, beginning in the early 1980s.[2][3] Snapple would not manufacture their first tea, lemon tea, until 1987.[4]
Currently, there are many different types of Snapple: Tea ( Multiple flavors along with original and diet), juice drinks, lemonade, and bottled water. Snapple is also bottled in the form of an aluminum can.[5]
Snapple's brand slogan is "Made from the Best Stuff on Earth."
Snapple was known for a popular series of TV advertisements in the early 1990s featuring Wendy Kaufman (the "Snapple Lady") answering letters from Snapple fans.[6] In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge commercials, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark “made from the best stuff on earth” line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products. By August 1992, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.[7]
The Quaker Oats Company bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994.[8] The company ran into problems and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.[9] Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000.[10] It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners.
Starting in May 2009, Snapple was made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. However, in certain areas, the older formula is still sold in stores, but this is becoming increasingly rare.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple in California. The suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present.[11]
In 2010, in a lawsuit against Snapple in the federal District of New Jersey, the court certified to the FDA for an administrative determination the question whether HFCS qualifies as a "natural" ingredient. In 2010, the FDA responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance. Stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation, the FDA again cited its limited resources and more pressing food-safety concerns.[12]
In 2011, a New York federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing Snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as "all natural." The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of Snapple's labeling.[13]
Snapple and New York City schools[edit]
In October 2003, Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system (and other parcels in the area), as part of the deal to make Snapple New York City's official beverage.[14] The company promised an $8 million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks, including juice and bottled water, in school vending machines.[14]
Snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because New York City officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas, which have been linked to childhood obesity, diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy. The Snapple juice drinks, specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools, are marketed under the "Snapple 100% Juiced!" label.[14] The flavors available under this brand include Green Apple, Fruit Punch, Melon Berry, Grape, Orange Mango, and Strawberry Lime.[14] Although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals, a 16-ounce bottle contains more sugar (41 grams) than a 12-ounce container of Coca-Cola (39 grams).[14]
Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the drinks "little better than vitamin-fortified sugar water."[14] In addition, the concentrates used in the drinks, apple, grape and pear, are the least expensive and nutritious. Dr. Toni Liquori, associate professor at the Columbia Teachers College, questioned the sale of bottled water in schools, saying "If anything, we should have cold water in our schools."[14]
The deal also gave Snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juice-based drinks in vending machines on all New York City properties starting in January 2004. Snapple paid the City $106 million for the rights and agreed to spend $60 million more to marketing and promotion over the length of the five-year contract.[15]
Rumors and myths[edit]
In the early 1990s the original label graphic on the Iced Tea flavor, a depiction of the United States historical event the Boston Tea Party, was replaced due to misinformation espoused by protest groups claiming the ships on the packaging were slave trading vessels in New York Harbor. Snapple also fell victim to a rumor that the small "K" was either a representation of the Klan, or of an imagined "Jewish Tax" (augmented by the fact that all three founders were Jewish). The "K" on the products actually meant that they were certified kosher.
Snapple initially tried to quell these rumors quietly, but ultimately had to launch a media campaign to squash them, pointing out it would be bad for business to support controversial issues in such a way as the rumors implied. Through a media campaign with the NAACP, Snapple successfully fought back these rumors, although occasionally they are still brought up as fact.[16][17]
"Real Facts"[edit]
Snapple is well known for printing interesting numbered "List of Snapple Real Fact facts" on the inside of their bottle caps. A list of these "Real Facts" are available on the company website.[18]




"Real Fact" #735. Each Snapple cap features a random factoid, some of which have been dismissed as misconceptions.[19]


Incorrect facts[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Several of the facts on Snapple caps have been found to be outdated, incorrect or exaggerated. Discredited "Real Facts" include:

#23 "The San Francisco cable cars are the only mobile national monument." The San Francisco Cable Cars as a group is a National Historic Landmark. National Monuments are a different designation. There are many ships that are National Historic Landmarks, as well as a few roller coasters.[20]
#31 "The average human will eat an average of eight spiders a year while asleep." This "statistic" was disseminated in 1993 as an example of the things people will believe simply because they come across them on the internet, as uncovered by Snopes.[21]
#36 "A duck's quack does not echo." Tested by Snopes and MythBusters. Both tests concluded that a duck's quack does echo but is hard to distinguish.[22]
#69 "Caller ID is illegal in California." There is no law against Caller ID in the state, though there were lengthy debates about making it illegal in the early 1990s.[23]
#77 "No piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times." This myth was proven wrong by Britney Gallivan in 2002 when she managed 12 folds. In 2005, drawing on Gallivan's accomplishment, MythBusters folded a piece of paper 11 times. The piece of paper used in Mythbusters was an oversized piece of paper that was thinner than a standard 8.5"x11" (21.59 x 27.94 cm) piece of paper.[24]
#89 "The average American walks 18,000 steps a day." Proven wrong, as the average American walks 5,117 steps a day.[25]
#114 "The oldest known animal was a tortoise, which lived to be 152 years old." A tortoise named Harriet once lived to be 175 years old[26] and the oldest known animal is Ming, a clam of the species arctica islandica, who lived to be 507 years old.[27]
#116 "The largest fish is the whale shark – it can be over 50 feet long and weigh 2 tons." Full-grown whale sharks do not weigh 2 tons (4,000 lbs or 1,820 kg), but are much heavier, weighing up to 16 tons (32,000 lbs or 14,550 kg).[28]
#140 "Holland is the only country with a national dog." Mexico also has a national dog (the Xoloitzcuintli).[29] Additionally, Holland is a region within the Netherlands, but is not technically a country in its own right[30] with the keeshond being the national dog of the Netherlands.[31]
#146 "The smallest county in America is New York County, better known as Manhattan."—Manhattan is actually the second-smallest county by land area after Kalawao County, Hawaii. Additionally, Arlington County, Virginia, the smallest self-governing county, is smaller in total area.
#162 "The temperature of the sun can reach up to 15 million degrees Fahrenheit." In fact, the core of the sun reaches 15 million degrees Celsius, about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.[32]
#163 "The first penny had the motto "Mind your own business."" The first official one-cent coin (known as a Fugio Cent) of the United States held the message "Mind Your Business" which, along with the image above it, formed a rebus meaning, time flies, do your work.
#744 "Polar bears can smell a seal from 20 miles away". According to Sea World, this distance is a much lower limit of about 1 km (0.6 miles).
#761 "Owls are one of the only birds that can see the color blue". In fact, birds have excellent color vision, with some being able to see even into the UV spectrum.
#769 "If a sheep and a goat mate the offspring is called a geep." A geep is produced by combining the embryos of a sheep and a goat. If they mate, the offspring is called a sheep-goat hybrid.
#793 "Broadway is one of the longest streets in the world. It is 150 miles long." Broadway terminates 32 miles (51.5 km) from its Manhattan origin. It continues north of Sleepy Hollow, New York as U.S. 9 and Albany Post Road.
#794 "Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the continental United States, and Zabriskien [sic] Point, the lowest point in the United States, are less than eighty miles apart." It is true that Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States, but Badwater Basin in Death Valley, (13 miles from Zabriskie Point) is the lowest point in the United States, at 282 feet below sea level, and is 84 miles from Mt. Whitney.[33]
#825 "Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing." The average newborn's eyeball is 16 to 18 millimeters in diameter (axial length). The infant's eyeball grows slightly to approximately 19.5 millimeters and by age 3 to 23mm. The eyeball continues to grow, gradually, to a diameter of about 24–25 millimeters in adulthood.[34]
#853 "Hawaii has its own time zone." Hawaii shares a time zone with the Aleutian Islands.
#868 "Thomas Jefferson invented the coat hanger." Claims that Thomas Jefferson invented the clothes hanger are unfounded according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello.[35]
#889 "The original Cinderella was Egyptian and wore fur slippers." It is true that Rhodopis is considered the oldest telling of the Cinderella story, but her slippers are consistently described as rose-gold. Some claim that Charles Perrault's classic French telling featured fur slippers, and that vair (fur) was mistranslated as verre (glass), but this is believed to be an urban legend.[36]
#904 "If done perfectly, any Rubik's Cube combination can be solved in 17 turns." In fact, it has been shown that there exists a starting position for Rubik's Cube that requires 20 turns to solve; furthermore 20 has also been proven to be the maximum number of moves required for solving from any initial scrambled state.[37]
#907 "Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors." There is no evidence supporting the claim that dueling is legal in Paraguay and it has been reported that the U.S. Paraguayan consulate also says it is not legal.[38]
#921 "If you had 1 billion dollars and spent 1 thousand dollars a day, it would take you 2,749 years to spend it all." If done correctly, simple math will show that it takes 2,738 years (counting leap years) to spend 1 billion dollars, not 2,749.
#975 "The letter J is the only letter in the alphabet that does not appear anywhere on the periodic table of the elements." This was true until 2012, when element 114 was officially renamed to Flerovium from its initial placeholder name ununquadium. Now both J and Q are missing from the periodic table.[39][40]

Snapple Beverage Corp (del) Revenue and Financial Data

   How sweet it is: Snapple Beverage produces more than 40 varieties of sweetened and diet ready-to-drink teas, juice drinks, and waters. Marketed as "the Best Stuff on Earth," the Snapple brand lineup is flavored with familiar fruits (apple and lemon), as well as the exotic (pomegranate and papaya). Drinks are sold directly to food/beverage retailers, mass merchandisers, and foodservice venues, such as school cafeterias in the US and some 80 other countries. Snapple was formerly part of the UK's Cadbury Schweppes. As part of the candy/beverage company's 2008 breakup, Cadbury Schweppes sold its beverage unit, including Snapple, to the Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages company, now the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
