Johnson Products Company is a privately held business formed in Chicago in the United States of America in 1954 by salesman George E. Johnson, Sr. It is best known for manufacturing a line of hair care and cosmetic products for African American consumers under the names Afro Sheen and Ultra Sheen. The company was a longtime sponsor of the syndicated US television dance show Soul Train until that program's cancellation.
The company was bought by Procter & Gamble in 2004 and its products were marketed as part of the P&G portfolio. In March 2009, a consortium of African-American investment firms bought the company from P&G to reestablish its position as the country's African-American-owned company.

Early life[edit]
Johnson was born in Richton, Mississippi, in a three-room sharecropper's shack.[1] When he was two, he moved to Chicago with his mother, Priscilla, after his parents had separated. At the age of eight, while attending Doolittle Elementary School, Johnson also started work as a shoe shine boy. He later attended Wendell Phillips High School but dropped out to work full-time jobs.[2] During the day he was a bus boy and in the evenings he set pins at a local bowling alley.[3] In 1944, he took a job working for Samuel B. Fuller, who owned a cosmetics firm, as a production chemist.
Entrepreneurship[edit]
In 1954, at the encouragement of co-worker, Johnson left the Fuller company and founded Johnson Products with his wife Joan,[4] focusing on the African American male hair care market. Johnson borrowed $250 from a bank and another $250 from a friend to finance the venture.[1] The company’s first product was Ultra Wave, a hair relaxer for men. In 1957, Ultra Sheen, a revolutionary hair straightener that could easily be used in the home, was introduced for women.
During the next quarter century, more product lines were introduced like Afro Sheen.[1] Afro-Sheen, one of Johnson's best-known products, was released in the late 1960s, at a time when the "Afro" became a popular hairstyle for African Americans.
Over the next few decades, Johnson Products continued to grow, focusing its efforts on not only its products line but on training cosmetologists on the proper usage as well. In 1964, Johnson founded Independence Bank, and during the 1970s he became the exclusive sponsor behind the nationally syndicated dance show Soul Train.
In 1971, Johnson Products became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[1]That same year, Johnson became the first African American to serve on the board of directors of Commonwealth Edison.
Awards and honors[edit]
George E. Johnson, Sr. received the Horatio Alger Award in 1981[5] and the Babson Medal in 1983[6]
He received an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science degree from College of the Holy Cross in 1975 and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Babson College in 1976[7]
In popular culture[edit]
A short documentary on George E. Johnson, Sr. and the Johnson Products Company was produced by The Czar of Black Hollywood director Bayer Mack and released by Block Starz Music Television as part of its Profiles of African-American Success video series. [8][9]

George and Joan Johnson


Image Ownership: Public Domain 



George Ellis Johnson, Sr. was an African American entrepreneur and founder of Johnson Products Company, a hair care firm, and Independence Bank in Chicago, Illinois.  Johnson was born on June 16, 1927 in Richton, Mississippi to Priscilla Johnson.  He is perhaps best known for being the first African American to have his company listed on the American Stock Exchange.

In 1929 when Johnson was two years old, he moved to Chicago, Illinois with his mother after she separated from his father.  He grew up in Chicago, and attended Wendell Phillips High School.  At eight Johnson began working as a shoe shine boy and later held jobs as a bus boy, a pin setter at a bowling alley, and paper boy for the Chicago Herald Tribune.  In 1944 he dropped out of school and accepted a job as a production chemist for the Samuel B. Fuller cosmetics firm.

Johnson remained at Fuller Cosmetics until 1954 when he left to found his own firm, Johnson Products Company.  He and his wife, Joan (Henderson) Johnson, started the company with only $500. Unlike earlier African American cosmetics firms which targeted women, Johnson developed his first products exclusively for male customers.  Johnson Products first success was Ultra Wave Hair Culture, which was a hair relaxer for men.    

In 1957, Johnson Products released a new hair straightener specifically for women called Ultra Sheen which, unique among such products, could be applied at home.  Soon Ultra Sheen surpassed Ultra Wave in sales and popularity.  In 1964, Johnson founded Independence Bank in Chicago which by the 1980s had become the largest black-owned bank in the United States.  Independence Bank was sold in 1994. 

Also in the late 1960s, sensing the growing popularity of "Afro" style hair with the rise of Black Power as a political philosophy, Johnson developed its most famous product, Afro Sheen.  By the late 1960s Johnson Products became the principal sponsor of the national television dance show, Soul Train. With markets in Africa, the West Indies, and Latin America by the early 1970s, Johnson Products Company had become the largest African American owned corporation in the United States.  

In 1971 Johnson Products Company became the first African American owned corporation listed on the American Stock Exchange.  George Johnson also became the first African American to serve on the board of directors of Commonwealth Edison, a large utility corporation in northeastern Ohio.  Johnson resigned as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Johnson Products Company in 1989.  Johnson Products Company was purchased by the Proctor and Gamble Corporation in 2004, but in March 2009 a consortium of African American investment firms bought the company.

The Johnsons have four children: Eric, Joan M., John, and George E. Johnson Jr.  The family lives in the Chicago area.
