These forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Teradata’s actual results to differ materially. In addition to the factors discussed in this release, other risks and uncertainties could affect our future results, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include those relating to: the global economic environment in general or on the ability of our suppliers to meet their commitments to us, or the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers, and other general economic and business conditions; the rapidly changing and intensely competitive nature of the information technology industry and the data analytics business, including the increased pressure on price/performance for data analytics solutions; fluctuations in our operating results, unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles and the difficulty of accurately estimating revenues; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our business transformation program, divestitures, senior management changes, or other restructuring and cost saving initiatives; risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, including the impact of economic, political, legal, regulatory, compliance, cultural, foreign currency fluctuations and other conditions abroad; the timely and successful development, production or acquisition and market acceptance of new and existing products and services, including our ability to accelerate market acceptance of new products and services as well as the reliability, quality, security and operability of new products because of the difficulty and complexity associated with their testing and production; tax rates; turnover of workforce and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees; availability and successful exploitation of new acquisition and alliance opportunities; our ability to execute integration plans for newly acquired entities, including the possibility that expected synergies and operating efficiencies may not be achieved, that such integration efforts may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, and that operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) may be greater than expected following the transaction; recurring revenue may decline or fail to be renewed; changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the resulting impact, if any, on the company’s accounting policies; continued efforts to establish and maintain best-in-class and secure internal information technology and control systems; and other factors described from time-to-time in the company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q, as well as the company’s annual reports to stockholders. The company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Victor L. Lund


















      Submitted by admin on Tue, 06/19/2012 - 20:00    

As reward for his great works here with us, Victor Lyle Lund, 87, was called home unexpectedly to rest in eternal peace on the evening of June 19, 2012. He was born July 5, 1924, in Lunds to Elmer and Anna (Paulson) Lund.
He was a member of the U.S. Army in the anti-aircraft division. Most of his career was spent in the trucking industry beginning in the 1940s at Huettl Trucking in Seymour. In 1946, Victor was employed at Olson Transportation. He attended driver safety classes at Northwestern University as well as driver training at Penn State University. He worked in the Safety Department and later as a driver trainer to dock foremen until the acquisition of CW Transport and Gerber Foods thereafter. Upon his formal retirement in 1986, Vic couldn't just sit and put his feet up. He ran Lunds Tavern for several years, followed by driving Shawano Medi-Van and for The Shawano Leader, Dearco and the Dialysis Center. He was a self-taught handyman and worked until his death, helping others. He was a charter member of Lund's Snowbirds Snowmobile Club, which was the first organized snowmobile club established in Wisconsin in 1970, and Vic was the last remaining charter member. He was a member of the Zion Lutheran Church of Shawano, where he served as an usher and also on the Jerusalem Cemetery Association. Anyone fortunate enough to have ever known him will forever remember his charming smile, contagious humor and never-ending kindness that so effortlessly embedded into their heart.
Victor married the late Grace (Pues) Nelson in July 1944. The couple welcomed four daughters into the world: Vicky (Don) Ebelt, Dawn (Carl) Meulmans, the late Nancy (Roger) Mathison and the late Sally Lund. On Aug. 21, 1964, he was blessed in marriage to his best friend, Barbara Jean Rogers, at the Jerusalem Lutheran Church in Lunds. Vic was a devoted husband and dedicated father to four more children, Jimmy Lemons, Linda (Mike) Pasterski, Debbie (the late Jeff) McCann and Kelly (Dave Druckrey) Lund. He was proud and honored to be the grandfather of 23 and the great-grandfather of 24, with the 25th expected in September. He instilled in these lives the silent beauty of nature and the unconditional love a true family is meant to be made of. He loved and lived for his family. Victor is further survived by his sister, Hazel Paulson.
He was preceded in death by his brother, Howard (Lavern) Lund; sister, Marcella (Frank) Casico; sister, Baby Lund; son-in-law, Jeff McCann; and grandchild, Corey Marcus Victor.
Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, June 23, 2012, at the Zion Lutheran Church in Shawano with the Rev. Dennis Nelson officiating. Burial will be in the Jerusalem Cemetery in the town of Waukechon. Visitation will be held at the Swedberg Funeral Home in Shawano on Friday from 4-8 p.m. and at the church on Saturday after 9:30 a.m. until the time of the service.
For all who know Vic well: "Take a shot of whiskey and a kissel of beer; it'll put hair on your chest!"
The family would like to extend a special thank you to the Shawano Police Department, the Shawano Ambulance Service and Pastor John Anderson from Hope Community Church for all your help, care and concern during this difficult time.
