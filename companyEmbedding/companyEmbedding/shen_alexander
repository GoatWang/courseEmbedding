CENTER VALLEY, Pa., June 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- TechPrecision Corporation, has appointed Alexander (Alex) Shen as President of Ranor, a wholly owned subsidiary division of TechPrecision Corporation, effective immediately. Mr. Shen replaces Robert Francis, who is departing to pursue other opportunities. 
Mr Shen has 31 years of demonstrated success in a broad range of industries including metal fabrication, automotive, contract manufacturing, safety and security, and industrial distribution.  Previously he served as CEO of Ryerson Mexico & Vice President – International for Ryerson, Inc., Division General Manager & COO at Sumitomo Electric Group, and he had a 10-year career at Alcoa's Automotive Division with roles of increasing responsibility.  Mr. Shen began his career with General Motors, moving to Chrysler, before joining Alcoa.  His career includes multiple international management roles in Japan, China, Mexico, and Europe, and he is fluent in the Chinese and Japanese languages and cultures.  Mr. Shen holds a B.S. in Engineering from Michigan State University.
"Alex brings great energy and commitment, evidenced by a track record of successful leadership in turnarounds and strategic growth opportunities including mergers and acquisitions," commented Leonard Anthony, Chairman of the Board and Principal Executive Officer. "With his hands-on style, well-honed skill sets and instincts, his expertise in scaling large-cap company practices to mid-cap and micro-cap firms, and his extensive global expertise, Alex is uniquely qualified to lead Ranor into the future. Alex has the full endorsement and support of the Board of Directors. We look forward to his leadership and welcome him to the TechPrecision and Ranor team."
Mr. Shen added, "Throughout my career, I have sought out and welcomed challenges such as Ranor. I'm excited about the opportunity to work with the Ranor team to achieve significant improvement in near term profitability and long-term growth. We will be very focused on rebuilding customer confidence and increasing shareholder value."
Mr. Francis has agreed to serve as a consultant to Ranor, facilitating a smooth transition. The Board of Directors of TechPrecision thanks Mr. Francis for his service and wishes him well in future endeavors.

About this Textbook




"Algorithms and Programming" is primarily intended for a first year undergraduate course in programming. Structured in a problem-solution format, the text motivates the student to think through the programming process, thus developing a firm understanding of the underlying theory. Although a moderate familiarity with programming is assumed, the book is easily utilized by students new to computer science. The more advanced chapters make the book useful for a graduate course in the analysis of algorithms and/or compiler construction.

New to the second edition are added chapters on suffix trees, games and strategies, and Huffman coding as well as an appendix illustrating the ease of conversion from Pascal to C. The material covers such topics as combinatorics, sorting, searching, queues, grammar and parsing, selected well-known algorithms, and much more.
 
Reviews of the 1st Edition:
"The book is addressed both to ambitious students and instructors looking for interesting problems [and] fulfills this task perfectly, especially if the reader has a good mathematical background."
— Zentralblatt MATH
"This book is intended for students, engineers, and other people who want to improve their computer skills.... The chapters can be read independently. Throughout the book, useful exercises give readers a feeling for how to apply the theory."
— Computing Reviews
"Overall...the book is well done. I recommend it to teachers and those wishing to sharpen their data structure and compiler skills."

From the reviews:"The book is addressed both to ambitious students and instructors looking for interesting problems [and] fulfills this task perfectly, especially if the reader has a good mathematical background." — Zentralblatt MATH"This book is intended for students, engineers, and other people who want to improve their computer skills.... The chapters can be read independently. Throughout the book, useful exercises give readers a feeling for how to apply the theory." — Computing Reviews"Overall...the book is well done. I recommend it to teachers and those wishing to sharpen their data structure and compiler skills." — SIGACT NewsFrom the reviews of the second edition:“An excellent source of material for college students … and for their teachers. … it contains a lot of great information for the computer science student. Ideally, students would acquire this book in their freshman year and begin using it as soon as they learn the basics of procedural programming. They will then find this book an excellent companion, as they develop their analytical and programming skills throughout the curriculum. … This book is a delight to read and work with. I highly recommend it.” (Edgar R. Chavez, ACM Computing Reviews, December, 2010)

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
