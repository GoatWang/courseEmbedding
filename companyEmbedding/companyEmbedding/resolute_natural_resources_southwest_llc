	Title Defect


	,” as used in this Agreement, means any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity, defect in or objection to Seller’s ownership of any Asset (excluding Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title to that Asset.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be asserted as a Title Defect:  (a) defects or irregularities arising out of lack of corporate authorization or a variation in corporate name, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate action or variation was not authorized and results in another Person’s superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; (b) defects or irregularities that have been cured or remedied by the passage of time, including applicable statutes of limitation and statutes for prescription or preemption; (c) defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in documents or omissions of heirship proceedings; (d) defects or irregularities in title which have not delayed or prevented Seller (or Seller’s predecessors) from receiving its Net Revenue Interest share of the proceeds of production and have not caused Seller to bear a share of expenses or costs greater than its Working Interest share from any Lease, unit or well; (e) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings or the lack of probate proceedings if the defects or irregularities have been outstanding for five (5) years or more; or (f) conventional rights or reassignment normally actuated by an intent to abandon or release a Lease and requiring notice to the holders of such rights and any defect or irregularity as would normally be waived by Persons engaged in the oil and gas business when purchasing producing properties.













	Section 4.04

	Notice of Title Defects


	.







	(a)

	If Buyer discovers any Title Def

	ect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify Seller of the alleged Title Defect as promptly as possible but no later than the expiration of the Examination Period.  To be effective, this notice (a “

	Title Defect Notice

	”) must (i) be in writing;


	15




	 



	(ii) be recei


	ved by Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the Title Defect in sufficient, specific detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest); (iv) identify the specific Asset or Assets aff


	ected by the Title Defect; and (v) include the value of the Title Defect as determined by Buyer.  Any matters that otherwise may have constituted Title Defects, but that are not so described in a timely Title Defect Notice complying and delivered in accord


	ance with this


	Section 4.04(a)


	, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted Encumbrances.





	(b)

	After receipt of an effective Title Defect Notice, Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attem

	pt to cure the Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing and to postpone the Closing Date (with respect to all of the Assets or only those Assets affected by the Title Defect) up to thirty (30) days beyond the date set forth in

	Section 12.01

	to facilitate the cure; provided however that the foregoing shall not limit Seller’s ability to elect remedies for Title Defects as provided in

	Section 4.05(a)

	.




	(c)

	The value attributable to each Title Defect (the “


	Title Defect Value

	”) that is asserted by Buyer in a Title Defect Notice shall be determined in good faith based upon the criteria set forth below:


	(i)

	If the Title Defect is a lien on any Asset, the Title Defect Value is the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset.





	(ii)

	If th

	e Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable to any well, unit, well location or Lease is less than that stated in

	Exhibit A-3

	or the Working Interest attributable to any well, unit, well location or Lease is greater than that stated in

	Exhibit A-3

	, then the Title Defect Value shall take into account the relative change in the interest from

	Exhibit A-3

	and the appropriate Allocated Value of such Asset.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “

	Allocated Value

	” means, with respect to any Asset, the amount allocated to that Asset under

	Section 11.01

	.


	(iii)

	If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge on the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for which there is not a proportionate

	increase in Net Revenue Interest) for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, the probability that a potential title failure will result in an actual title failure, the Title Defect Value placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller, and any such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.


	(iv)

	If a Title Defect is not in effect, affects only certain depths, or does not adversely affect an Asset throughou

	t the entire productive life of such Asset, the consequences of that fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value.


	16




	 





	(v)


	The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses include


	d in another Title Defect Value.



	(vi)

	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the wells, units, well locations or other Assets affected by it.



	(vii)

	To give Seller an

	opportunity to commence reviewing possible Title Defects, Buyer shall make a good faith effort to give Seller, on or before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time each Friday prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, notice of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration of the Examination Period.












	Section 4.05

	Remedies for Title Defects


	.





	(a)

	Subject to the continuing right of Seller to dispute the existence of a

	n asserted Title Defect or the asserted Title Defect Value and subject to the rights of the Parties under

	Section 13.01(f)

	, if any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with

	Section 4.04(a)

	is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:


	(i)

	subject to


	Section 4.05(d)

	, reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value for the Title Defect as determined in accordance with

	Section 4.04(c)

	or

	Article XVIII

	(which shall cause such asserted Title Defect to become an Assumed Obligation under

	Section 16.02

	);




	(ii)

	indemnify Buyer against all claims resulting from the Title Defect (an “


	Indemnified Title Defect

	”) pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the “

	Title Indemnity Agreement

	”);

	provided

	,

	however

	, that without Buyer’s consent, Seller shall not be entitled to elect to indemnify Buyer under this

	Section 4.05(a)(ii)

	for any Title Defect that is a discrepancy in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest of a well, unit, well location or Lease (as compared to the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest set forth in

	Exhibit A-3

	with respect to such Asset); or




	(iii)


	retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to the Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Asset and the associated Assets.


	(b)

	If any Title

	Defect is in the nature of an unobtained consent to assignment or other restriction on assignability, the provisions of

	Section 4.08

	shall apply.




	(c)

	If at or before the Closing Buyer and Seller have not agreed on the validity of any asserted Title Defect

	or the Title Defect Value attributable to the Title Defect and Seller has not elected to indemnify Buyer with respect to the Title Defect under

	Section 4.05(a)(ii)

	or to retain the Assets associated with the Title Defect under

	Section 4.05(a)(iii)

	, Buyer or Seller shall have the right to elect to have the Dispute regarding the validity of the Title Defect or the Title Defect Value determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with

	Article XVIII

	.  In that


	17




	 



	event, the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall


	not be reduced by virtue of the disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value, but upon the final resolution of the Dispute, the Title Defect Value, if any, found to be attributable to the Title Defect shall, subject to


	Section 4.05(d)


	, be refunded by Seller


	to Buyer within five (5) Business Days of such resolution.





	(d)

	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to


	Section 4.05(e)

	, (i) if the value of a particular individual Title Defect (or individual Title Benefit, except for an Asset on which there is a Title Defect exceeding $50,000) does not exceed $50,000, then it shall be deemed to be a Permitted Encumbrance and no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for the Title Defect (or Title Benefit), (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for the sum of all Title Defects and Environmental Defects (after taking into account clause (i) and the limitation in clause (i) of Section 5.04(c)) does not exceed three percent (3%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then they shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances and no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made on account of Title Defects, and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for the sum of all Title Defects and Environmental Defects (after taking into account clause (i) and the limitation in clause (i) of Section 5.04(c)) does exceed three percent (3%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted only by the amount of the excess.














	Section 4.06

	Special Warranty of Title


	.  The documents to be executed and delivered by Seller to Buyer transferring title to the Assets as required hereby, including the Assignment and Bill of Sale attached hereto as

	Exhibit B

	(the “


	Assignment


	”), shall provide for a special warranty of title warranting title by, through and under Seller, but not otherwise, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the terms of this Agreement.  Buyer’s remedy for breach of Seller’s special warranty of title in the Assignment shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, and any claims for such breach must be asserted within twelve (12) months from the Closing Date.  Any such claims not asserted within such twelve (12) month period shall be deemed to be Assumed Obligations.















	Section 4.07

	Preferential Rights To Purchase


	.  





	(a)

	Seller shall use reasonable efforts, but

	without any obligation to incur any additional cost or expense, to comply with all preferential right to purchase provisions relative to any Asset (“

	PPRs

	”) prior to the Closing.  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer of the existence of any known PPRs and if any PPRs are exercised or if the requisite period has elapsed without said rights having been exercised.  






	(b)

	If, as of the Closing Date, a Third-Party holder of a PPR has timely and properly notified Seller that it elects to exercise its PP

	R with respect to the Assets to which its PPR applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement in which the PPR arises), then the Assets covered by that PPR will be sold to such holder of the PPR, and will not be sold to the Party originally executing this Agreement as “Buyer” (subject to the remaining provisions in this Article) and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Assets.  Buyer shall remain obligated to purchase the remainder of the Assets not affected by an


	18




	 



	exercised PPR.  Upon the consummation of the sale of any Assets to the holder of such PPR, any such Assets shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute “Excluded Assets”.



	(c)

	After the Closing, if for any reason the purchase and sale of the

	Assets covered by a PPR exercised prior to Closing under (b) above is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the PPR that exercised its PPR, Seller shall so notify Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer’s receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller such Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the Allocated Value of such Assets (except the Closing Date with respect to such Assets will be the date of assignment of such Assets from Seller to Buyer).


	(d)

	Any interest in the Assets covered by any unexercised PPRs (whether due to the PPR notice period or otherwise) shall be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing subject to any PPRs, and Buyer shall assume all d

	uties, obligations and liabilities arising from the PPR.  Without limiting the foregoing, if any Third Party elects to purchase all or a part of an interest in any Asset subject to a PPR after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be obligated to convey that interest to that Third Party and shall be entitled to the consideration for the sale of that interest.














	Section 4.08

	Consents to Assignment


	.  Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents from Third Parties to assign the Assets prior to the Closing (other than approvals of any relevant Governmental Authority that are customarily obtained after the Closing), and Buyer shall assist Seller with those efforts.  If the holder of any consent requires that the Buyer deliver proof of its creditworthiness for the approval of such consent, then the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and the holder of such consent and deliver to such holder any reasonably-requested credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of Buyer.  To the extent any such consents are not obtained prior to Closing and an express provision of the document providing for the consent would render the assignment of some or all of the Assets void or voidable, give rise to a claim for specified liquidated damages or cause the termination of the Lease or other Asset to be assigned as a result of the failure to obtain that consent, then that failure shall constitute a Title Defect as to the portion of the Assets affected thereby, and the provisions of


	Section 4.05(a)


	shall apply thereto.  In all other cases, such unobtained consents shall not constitute Title Defects.

















	Section 4.09

	Title Benefits; Remedies


	.  



	(a)

	If either Party discovers a

	ny Title Benefit during the Examination Period affecting the Assets, it shall promptly notify the other Party at or before the expiration of the Examination Period.  Subject to

	Section 4.05(d)

	, Seller shall be entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to

	Section 12.02(a)(iii)

	with respect to the Title Benefit, in an amount mutually agreed upon by the Parties.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “

	Title Benefit

	” means the Seller’s interest in any Asset that is greater than or in addition to that set forth in

	Exhibit A-3

	, including a Net Revenue Interest that is greater than that set forth in

	Exhibit A-3

	or Seller’s Working Interest in any Asset that is less than the Working Interest set forth in

	Exhibit A-3

	(without a corresponding decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).


	19




	 





	(b)


	If, with respect to a Title Benefit, Buyer and Seller have not agreed on the amount of the upward Purchase Price Adjustment or have not otherwise agreed on such amount at or prior to the Closing, Seller or Buyer s


	hall have the right to elect to have the Dispute regarding the Purchase Price Adjustment determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with


	Article XVIII


	.  In that event, Buyer shall pay the undisputed portion of the Purchase Price with respect to the


	Asset affected by the Title Benefit at the Closing and, subject to


	Section 4.05(d)


	, upon determination of the amount of the adjustment, shall pay to Seller any unpaid portion within five (5) Business Days of such determination.



















	Article V

















	Environmental Matters












	Section 5.01

	Environmental Review


	.





	(a)

	Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant reasonably acceptable to Seller (“


	Buyer’s Environmental Consultant

	”) to conduct an environmental review of the Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (“

	Buyer’s Environmental Review

	”).  The cost and expense of Buyer’s Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer.  The scope of work comprising Buyer’s Environmental Review shall be limited to a Phase I review and otherwise as may be agreed by Buyer and Seller prior to commencement.  The Environmental Review shall not include any intrusive test, sampling, boring, or procedure without the prior written consent of Seller.  Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyer’s Environmental Consultant to, (i) consult with Seller before conducting any work comprising Buyer’s Environmental Review, (ii) perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Assets and (iii) comply with all applicable Laws.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for obtaining any consents from a Third Party that are required to perform any work comprising Buyer’s Environmental Review, and Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to requesting each such consent. Seller shall have the right to have a representative or representatives accompany Buyer and Buyer’s Environmental Consultant at all times during Buyer’s Environmental Review.  With respect to any samples taken in connection with Buyer’s Environmental Review, Buyer shall take split samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified, to Seller without charge.  Buyer releases, and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, Seller Indemnitees from and against all Losses

	(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER’S SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY, BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT)

	arising out of, related to, or caused by Buyer’s Environmental Review.  If Buyer desires to conduct a Phase II review and Seller does not provide its consent, Buyer shall have the right to exclude only the affected Asset from the terms of this Agreement; provided however, that in the event it is impractical to exclude the affected Asset and Seller does not provide its consent for a Phase II review, then each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.  In no event shall the Examination Period be extended for purposes of accommodating a Phase II review by Seller.






	(b)

	Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyer’s Environmental Consultant to, treat confidentially any matters revealed by Buyer’s Environmental Review and any reports or data generated from such re

	view (the “

	Environmental



	20




	 



	Information


	”), and Buyer shall not, and shall cause Buyer’s Environmental Consultant to not, disclose any Environmental Information to any Governmental Authority or other Third Party without the prior written consent of Seller.  Bu


	yer may use the Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  If Buyer, Buyer’s Environmental Consultant or any Third Party to which Buyer has provided any Environmental Information become legally compe


	lled to disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to allow Seller to file any protective order or seek any other remedy, as Seller deems appropriate under th


	e circumstances.  If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Environmental Information to Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole property of Seller without charge.



	(c)

	Upon completion of Buyer’s

	Environmental Review, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to the Seller Indemnitees (1) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with any Buyer’s Environmental Review, (2) restore the Assets to the same or better condition in existence prior to commencement of any Buyer’s Environmental Review, and (3) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in connection with any Buyer’s Environmental Review.  Any disturbance to the Assets (including the real property associated with such Assets) resulting from Buyer’s Environmental Review will be promptly corrected by Buyer.


	(d)

	During all periods that Buyer, or any of Buyer’s representatives are on the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole ex

	pense and with insurers reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts reasonably requested by Seller.  Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to Seller prior to entering upon the Assets.

	Section 5.04(c)

	, reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value for the Environmental Defect as determined in accordance with

	Section 5.02(c)

	or

	Article XVIII

	(which shall cause such alleged Environmental Defect to become an Assumed Obligation under

	Section 16.02

	);




	(ii)

	indemnify Buyer against all claims resulting from the Environmental Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the “

	(c)

	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

	Agreement (i) if the Environmental Defect Value for a particular individual Environmental Defect does not exceed $50,000, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Environmental Defect, (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for the sum of all Environmental Defects and Title Defects (each exceeding $50,000) does not exceed three percent (3%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made on account of Environmental Defects, and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for the sum of all Environmental Defects and Title Defects (each exceeding $50,000) does exceed three percent (3%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted only by the amount of such excess.

	24




	 



	requisite information with which to det


	ermine the exact condition of the Assets or the effect that any such use has had on the physical condition of the Assets, and Seller does not make any representation or warranty with respect to those matters and Buyer expressly assumes all liability for th


	ose matters

	(a)

	The Unadjusted Purchase Price has been allocated among the Assets by Buyer as set forth in


	Exhibit A-3

	.  Buyer represents that the Allocated Values constitute reasonable and good faith allocations of the Unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets.  Seller


	32

	(b)


	Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, under Section 1060 of the Code, Buyer and Seller must report information regarding the allocation of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (as adjusted by the Purchase Price Adjustments) to the United States Secretary of Treasury by attaching Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Form 8594 to their federal income tax returns for the tax period which includes the Closing Date.  Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller will mutually agree regarding allocation of the Purchase Price (the “

	Allocation Schedule

	”) and shall prepare their respective Forms 8594 with respect to transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.  The Allocation Schedule shall be prepared consistent with the Allocated Values set forth in

	Exhibit A-3

	and shall be revised to take into account the Purchase Price Adjustments consistent with the provisions set forth in this

	Section 11.01

	.  Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position inconsistent with such allocation, as updated by the Parties to reflect any adjustments pursuant to this Agreement and any assumed obligations or other items treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes, on any income Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable Law or a “determination,” within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code;

	provided, however

	, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority based upon or arising out of such allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority challenging such allocation.














	Section 11.02

	Transfer Taxes


	.  Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment of, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller (and its members, managers, officers, employees and agents) from and against, all Transfer Taxes, if any.  Buyer shall prepare and file when due all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes;


	provided


	,


	however


	, that Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and take any action reasonably requested by Buyer that does not cause Seller to incur any cost or inconvenience to minimize any such Transfer Taxes.  Any Transfer Taxes imposed on or paid by Seller shall be promptly reimbursed to Seller by Buyer upon written demand therefor.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “


	Transfer Taxes


	” means any and all Taxes (excluding Taxes measured in whole or in part by net income), including sales, use, excise, stock, conveyance, gross receipts, registration, business and occupation, securities transactions, real estate, stamp, documentary, notarial, filing, recording, permit, license, authorization and similar Taxes, fees, duties, levies, customs, tariffs, imposts, assessments, obligations and charges arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any and all professional costs associated with them and the preparation and filing of their Tax Returns.

	Severance and Ad Valorem Taxes


	.  For purposes of this Agreement, (a) Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of Hydrocarbons, or that are imposed on a transactional basis, shall be deemed attributable to the period during which the production of the Hydrocarbons or the transaction with respect to such Taxes occurred, as applicable, and liability therefor shall be allocated to Seller for such Taxes through the Effective Time and to Buyer for post-Effective Time Taxes, without duplicating any adjustment to the Purchase Price required by


	Section 12.02


	, and (b) all ad valorem, property, and similar Taxes with respect to the Assets assessed with respect to a period which begins before, and ends after,



	33




	 



	the Effective Time (including such Taxes levied for the 2017 tax year) shall be prorated based on the number of days in such period  through the day in which the Effective Time occurs and the number of days in such period that occur af


	ter such day, without duplicating any adjustment to the Purchase Price required by


	Section 12.02


	.  All ad valorem, property, and similar Taxes with respect to the Assets levied with respect to any period which begins after the Effective Time shall be a lia


	bility allocated to Buyer.  If an ad valorem, property, or similar Tax for a period that includes the Effective Date has not been levied as of the Closing, the amount of such Tax shall be estimated at the Closing utilizing the most recent information avail


	able regarding such Tax.  For the avoidance of doubt, “such Taxes levied for the 2016 tax year” means the Taxes levied in 2016 that are computed by reference to the assessed valuation that is determined based on the value of production in 2015, and “such T


	axes levied for the 2017 calendar year” means the Taxes levied in 2017 that are computed by reference to the assessed valuation that is determined based on the value of production in 2016.

	ion in Tax that may be available with respect to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

	reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits, examinations or other tax proceedings by, or disputes with, taxing authorities regarding a

	ny Tax with respect to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;


	(c)

	make available to the other, and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested, any information, records, and documents relating to a Tax incurred or imposed with r

	espect to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and


	(d)

	provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audit, examination, or assessment that could reasonably be expected to affect the other’s Tax li

	ability under applicable Law or this Agreement (a “

	Tax Controversy

	”), and to promptly furnish the other with copies of all correspondence with respect to any Tax Controversy; and allow the other to participate, at its own expense, in any Tax Controversy, and not settle any Tax Controversy without the prior written consent of the other, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

	Section 15.02


	Limitations on the Operational Obligations and Liabilities of Seller


	.



	(a)

	Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in some or all of the Assets, and Buyer ag

	rees that, as long as Seller has voted its interests in a manner that complies with the provisions of this

	Article XV

	, the acts or omissions of the other working interest owners shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this

	Article XV

	, nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation.  To the extent that Seller or an Affiliate of Seller is not the operator of an Asset, the obligations of Seller in this

	Article XV

	shall be construed to require that Seller use reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any material expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the operator of that Asset to take such actions or render such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements.




	(b)

	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this


	Article XV

	, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer for, Buyer hereby releases, and Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its members, managers, Affiliates, co-lessees, co-venturers and its and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, partners, representatives, members, shareholders, Affiliates, subsidiaries, successors and assigns (collectively, “

	Seller Indemnitees

	”) from, the incorrect payment of delay rentals, royalties, shut-in royalties or similar payments or for any failure to pay any such payments through mistake or oversight

	(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER INDEMNITEES’ SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY)

	to the extent that such payments relate to periods after the Effective Time.  In no event shall Buyer’s remedy for Seller’s breach of its obligations under this

	Article XV

	exceed the Allocated Value of the Subject Interest affected by such breach.














	Section 15.03

	Operation of the Assets after the Closing


	.  Except as provided in  the Transition Services Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that Seller shall not be obligated to continue operating any of the operated Assets following the Closing and Buyer assumes full responsibility for operating (or causing the operation of) all such Assets following the Closing.  Seller does not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the operator of the operated Assets or any portion of the Assets, as such matter will be controlled by the applicable joint operating agreement(s).  Without implying any obligation on a Seller’s part to continue operating any operated Assets after the Closing, if Seller elects to continue to operate any such Assets following the Closing at the request of Buyer or any Third Party working interest owner, due to constraints of applicable joint operating agreement(s), failure of a successor operator to take over operations or other reasonable cause, the continued operation by Seller shall be for the account of Buyer, at the sole risk, cost and expense of Buyer.  Buyer releases and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller Indemnitees, as a part of the Assumed Obligations, from all Losses

	(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER INDEMNITEES’ SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY BUT NOT SELLER’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT)

	with respect to (a) continued operations by Seller, (b) Buyer’s assumption of operations from Seller, and (c) compliance with the terms of any applicable joint operating agreement related to the election of a successor operator.  Seller and Buyer shall each during their respective period of operatorship conduct or cause to be conducted all operations on the



	44




	 



	Assets after Closing in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable Law and agreements.

	the condition of, the Assets from the Effective Time until the Closing, including with respect to the depletion of Hydrocarbons, the watering-out of any well, the collapse of casing, sand infiltration of wells and damage to and depreciation of property, including normal wear and tear.




	(b)

	If after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing any part of the Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent

	domain or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or proceeding, or the threat of any such destruction, taking or proceeding, and the Parties shall proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such destruction or taking without reduction of the Purchase Price, but subject to

	Section 16.04

	.  Seller shall maintain its existing insurance coverage with respect to the Assets from the Execution Date until Closing.


	(c)

	Notwithstanding


	Section 15.04(a)

	, in the event of any loss described in

	Retained Obligations


	.  Provided that the Closing occurs and subject to Buyer’s indemnification obligations set forth in


	Section 16.03


	, Seller shall retain (but only to the extent the same do not constitute Permitted Encumbrances, Indemnified Title Defects, Assumed Environmental Obligations or Indemnified Environmental Defects) all Losses related to (a) the payment or improper payment or distribution by Seller of suspense revenues and royalties accruing under the Leases prior to the Effective Time; (b) the mispayment or non-payment of ad valorem, property, severance, and production Taxes attributable to the Assets prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such Taxes are allocable to the Seller in accordance with the principles of

	.





	(a)

	For purposes of this


	Section 16.05

	, the term “

	Indemnifying Party

	” when used in connection with particular Losses shall mean the Party having an obligation to indemnify another Person with respect to such Losses pursuant to this Agreement, and the term “

	Indemnified Party

	” when used in connection with particular Losses shall mean the Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Losses by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement.




	(b)

	To make claim for indemnif

	ication under any of

	Section 16.03

	or

	16.04

	, an Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this

	Section 16.05

	, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the “

	Claim Notice

	”).  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a “

	Claim

	”), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice of a Claim as provided in this

	Section 16.05

	shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under

	Section 16.03

	or

	16.04

	(as applicable) only to the extent that failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to defend effectively against the Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend against the Claim.


	(c)

	In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Party, on or before the 30th day after its receipt of the Claim Notice, shall notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denie

	s its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.  The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and before the expiration of this 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.




	(d)

	If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party, the In

	demnifying Party shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.  The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings with counsel of the Indemnifying Party’s choosing, including any compromise or settlement of the Claim.  If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest.  The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this

	Section 16.05

	.  Without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, an Indemnifying Party shall not (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Claim which does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim or (ii) settle any Claim


	48




	 



	or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect any Claim in any manner


	that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).



	(e)

	If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to defend the Indemnified Party or admits its liability to defend

	the Indemnified Party but fails diligently to prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnifying Party’s choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability to defend the Indemnified Party and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to its settlement or final determination.  If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend the Indemnified Party for a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option, on or before the tenth (10th) day following receipt of that notice (i) to admit in writing its liability to defend the Indemnified Party for the Claim, and (ii) if its liability to defend the Indemnified Party is so admitted, to reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.


	(f)

	In the case of a claim for ind

	emnification not based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice (i) to cure the Losses complained of, (ii) to admit its liability for those Losses, or (iii) to dispute the claim for those Losses.  If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within this 30-day period that it has cured the Losses or that it disputes the claim for those Losses, the amount of those Losses shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

	RESOLUTE ENERGY CORPORATION ENTERS INTO NEW CREDIT FACILITY; REPORTS 2016 RESERVES AND PRODUCTION


	 


	-- Fourth quarter exit rate in excess of 20,800 Boe per day --


	-- Reserves increase 82%

	to 60.3

	million Boe --


	-- Closed new bank facility; $150 million initial borrowing base --


	-- Earnings conference call


	scheduled for March 14, 2017 --


	 


	Denver, Colorado –

	February 22, 2017 – Resolute Energy Corporation (“Resolute” or the “Company”) (NYSE: REN) today provided detail on its year-end 2016 reserves and production.



	 


	Rick Betz, Resolute’s Chief Executive Officer, commented: “During 2016 Resolute produced an average of nearly 14,200 Boe per day, above the high end of guidance. More importantly, the 2016 exit rate was more than 20,800 Boe per day, with more than 14,700 Boe per day, or 71 percent, coming from the Permian Basin. In addition to exceeding our production guidance, Resolute also met or beat the midpoint of guidance for lease operating expense and production taxes, and was within the guidance range on general and administrative expense.


	 


	“On February 17, 2017, we closed a new revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of $150 million.  Coupled with our projected cash flow, we expect that this credit facility and borrowing base will provide ample liquidity to undertake and complete our two rig 2017 Delaware Basin drilling program. Also, effective today, Moody's Investors Service upgraded Resolute’s Corporate Family Rating to B3 from Caa2, with a stable outlook.


	 


	“Proved reserves increased by 82 percent from year-end 2015 largely due to our successful 2016 Delaware Basin drilling program and despite using lower SEC commodity prices in 2016. Year-end 2016 proved reserves were 60.3 MMBoe, of which 86 percent was crude oil and natural gas liquids. Year-end reserves reflect the addition of 37.2 MMBoe of proved reserves. The pre-tax SEC PV10 of our proved reserves at year-end 2016 was $344.2 million (a non-GAAP financial measure), and the after-tax value was $343.6 million. Both metrics are up 73 percent from year-end 2015.”


	 


	New Bank Facility


	 


	On February 17, 2017, the Company closed on its amended and restated revolving credit facility, with an initial borrowing base of $150 million, an increase from the previous level of $105 million.  In addition, the maturity date of the facility was extended to February 2021, and certain other terms and conditions were modified, including those to reflect the fact that the Company extinguished its second lien term loan facility in January 2017.  Bank of Montreal is the Administrative Agent under the new revolving credit facility. As of the date of this release we have no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility.


	 


	Operations Update


	 




	In December we brought on line the Harrison C20 1402H, a mid-length Wolfcamp A lateral in Mustang.  In mid-January, as planned, we added a second drilling rig in the Delaware Basin.  


	 




	 



	One rig is drilling in Mustang and the other is drilling in Appaloosa.  Since the first of the year we have drilled the South Elephant U


	04H, a long lateral Wolfcamp A in Appaloosa and the Harpoon L05H, a mid-length lateral Wolfcamp A in Mustang; both of these wells are waiting on completion.  Also, we completed the Renegade L02H and Renegade U03H wells, both mid-length Wolfcamp A laterals


	in Mustang, both of which are flowing back.  The Renegade wells are our first upper and lower Wolfcamp A downspacing test.  



	 


	Year-End 2016 Proved Reserves


	 


	At December 31, 2016, Resolute's estimated proved reserves were 60.3 MMBoe, compared to year-end 2015 proved reserves of 33.1 MMBoe. Approximately 73 percent of the Company's


	2016 year-end proved reserves was crude oil, 14 percent was gas and 13 percent was natural gas liquids. Undeveloped reserves comprised 38 percent of total proved reserves.


	 


	The present value of the Company's estimated future net revenues from proved reserves was estimated to be $344.2 million pre-tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, and $343.6 million after-tax as of December 31, 2016, using SEC pricing guidelines for year-end 2016, discounted at ten percent. Pricing used in calculating the year-end 2016 present value of our reserves was $42.75 per barrel of oil and $2.48 per MMBtu of gas.  For the prior year-end report, pricing was $50.28 per barrel of oil and $2.59 per MMBtu of gas.  All prices were adjusted for differentials and NGL content, and the analysis excluded the impact of hedges.


	 


	The increase in proved reserves from year-end 2015 to year-end 2016 was largely driven by successful drilling of previously non-proved Delaware Basin locations, both operated and non-operated. New well completions and acquisitions of additional interests in Mustang yielded additions of 14.8 MMBoe of net proved developed producing reserves and 17.9 MMBoe of net proved undeveloped reserves in twenty immediate offset Delaware Basin locations. Also, 4.5 MMBoe of net proved developed non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves were added to Aneth Field in connection with newly identified compression and deepening projects.


	 


	Closed sale of New Mexico properties


	 


	On February 22, Resolute closed the sale of our New Mexico properties that we announced on January 17, 2017.  The properties were purchased by a private buyer for $15 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The sale is effective as of October 1, 2016. The proceeds of the sale will be used for general corporate purposes.


	 


	Lantana Energy Advisors, a division of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., acted as financial advisor to Resolute on the New Mexico sale.

Corporate profile	

Resolute Energy Corporation is a leading operator in the Delaware Basin of West Texas, one of the most prolific and economic oil producing basins in the United States.




Our 16,300 net acres and 375 plus potential development locations in Reeves County Texas are concentrated, operated and have been substantially de-risked by drilling.  We focus on drilling mid and long length laterals in the Wolfcamp formation and Resolute wells have been recognized as some of the best in the basin.
Our first quarter production makes us one of the larger producers in the basin and with the completion of recently announced or planned divestitures Resolute will be one of a very few pure play Delaware Basin producers with industry leading organic production growth and well level economics.  Resolute is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “REN”.
