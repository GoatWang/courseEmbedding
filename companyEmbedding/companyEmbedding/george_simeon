Early life and education[edit]
Georges Simenon was born at 26 rue Léopold (now number 24) in Liège to Désiré Simenon and his wife Henriette. Désiré Simenon worked in an accounting office at an insurance company and had married Henriette in April 1902. Although Georges Simenon was born on Friday 13 February 1903[2] superstition resulted in his birth being registered as having been on the 12th.[3] This story of his birth is recounted at the beginning of his novel Pedigree.




26 rue Léopold, the house where Simenon was born


The Simenon family traces its origins back to the Limburg region, his mother's family being from Dutch Limburg.[citation needed] His mother had origins from both the Netherlands and Germany while his father was of Walloon origins.[4] One of her more notorious ancestors was Gabriel Brühl, a criminal who preyed on Limburg from the 1720s until he was hanged in 1743. Later, Simenon would use Brühl as one of his many pen names.[citation needed]
In April 1905, two years after Georges Simenon's birth, the family moved to 3 rue Pasteur (now 25 rue Georges Simenon) in Liège's Outremeuse (fr) neighborhood. Georges Simenon's brother Christian was born in September 1906 and eventually became their mother's favorite child, much to Georges Simenon's chagrin. Later, in February 1911, the Simenons moved to 53 rue de la Loi, also in the Outremeuse. In this larger home, the Simenons were able to take in lodgers. Typical among them were apprentices and students of various nationalities, giving the young Simenon an important introduction to the wider world; this marked his novels, notably Pedigree and Le Locataire.
At the age of three, Simenon learned to read at the Saint-Julienne nursery school. Then, between 1908 and 1914, he attended the Institut Saint-André. In September 1914, shortly after the beginning of the First World War, he began his studies at the Collège Saint-Louis, a Jesuit high school.
In February 1917, the Simenon family moved to a former post office building in the Amercoeur neighborhood. June 1919 saw another move, this time to the rue de l'Enseignement, back in the Outremeuse neighborhood.
Using his father's heart condition as a pretext, Simenon decided to put an end to his studies in June 1918, not even taking the Collège Saint-Louis' year-end exams. He subsequently worked a number of very short-term odd jobs.
Career beginnings[edit]
In January 1919, the 15-year-old Simenon took a job at the Gazette de Liège,[4] a newspaper edited by Joseph Demarteau. While Simenon's own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories, it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city, including politics, bars, and cheap hotels but also crime, police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist Edmond Locard. Simenon's experience at the Gazette also taught him the art of quick editing. He wrote more than 150 articles under the pen name "G. Sim."[citation needed] He began submitting stories to Le Matin in the early 1920s.[5]
Simenon's first novel, Au Pont des Arches, was written in June 1919 and published in 1921 under his "G. Sim" pseudonym. Writing as "Monsieur Le Coq", he also published more than 800 humorous pieces between November 1919 and December 1922.[citation needed] He stopped writing for the Gazette in December 1922.[4]
During this period, Simenon's familiarity with nightlife, prostitutes, drunkenness and carousing increased. The people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists, bohemian artists and even two future murderers, the latter appearing in his novel Les Trois crimes de mes amis. He also frequented a group of artists known as "La Caque". While not really involved in the group, he did meet his future wife Régine Renchon through it.
From 1921 to 1934 he used a total of 17 pen names while writing 358 novels and short stories.[5]
In France, 1922–1945[edit]
Simenon's father died in 1922 and this served as the occasion for the author to move to Paris with Régine Renchon (hereafter referred to by her nickname "Tigy"), at first living in the 17th arrondissement, not far from the Boulevard des Batignolles. He became familiar with the city, its bistros, cheap hotels, bars and restaurants. More importantly, he also came to know ordinary working-class Parisians. Writing under numerous pseudonyms, he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends.
Simenon and Tigy returned briefly to Liège in March 1923 to marry. Despite his Catholic upbringing, Simenon was not a believer. Tigy came from a thoroughly non-religious family. However, Simenon's mother insisted on a church wedding, forcing Tigy to become a nominal convert, learning the Catholic Church's catechism. Despite their father's lack of religious convictions, all of Simenon's children would be baptized as Catholics. Marriage to Tigy, however, did not prevent Simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women, perhaps most famously, Josephine Baker.
A reporting assignment had Simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in 1928, giving him a taste for boating. In 1929, he decided to have a boat built, the Ostrogoth. Simenon, Tigy, their cook and housekeeper Henriette Liberge, and their dog Olaf lived on board the Ostrogoth, travelling the French canal system. Henriette Liberge, known as "Boule" (literally "Ball," a reference to her slight pudginess) was romantically involved with Simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family, really part of it.[6]




Maigret statue in Delfzijl


In 1930, the most famous character invented by Simenon, Commissaire Maigret, made his first appearance in a piece in Detective written at Joseph Kessel's request. This first ever Maigret detective story was written while boating in The Netherlands, particularly in and around the Dutch town of Delfzijl. A statue of Maigret in Delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this.
1932 saw Simenon travel extensively, sending back reports from Africa, eastern Europe, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. A trip around the world followed in 1934 and 1935.
Between 1932 and 1936, Simenon, Tigy, and Boule lived at La Richardière, a 16th-century manor house in Marsilly at the Charente-Maritime département. The house is evoked in Simenon's novel Le Testament Donadieu. At the beginning of 1938, he rented the villa Agnès in La Rochelle, and published La Suspect, and then, in August, purchased a farm house in Nieul-sur-Mer (also in the Charente-Maritime) where his and Tigy's only child, Marc, was born in 1939.
Simenon lived in the Vendée during the Second World War.[3] Simenon's conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy, with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the Germans while others disagree, viewing Simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator. Further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the Gestapo suspected him of being Jewish, apparently conflating the names "Simenon" and "Simon". In any case, Simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with German studios during the occupation and in 1950 was sentenced to a five-year period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work. This sentence, however, was kept from the public and had little practical effect.
The war years did see Simenon produce a number of important works, including Le Testament Donadieu, Le Voyageur de la Toussaint and Le Cercle des Mahé. He also conducted important correspondence, most notably with André Gide.
Also in the early 1940s, Simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition (a reminder of his father), giving him only months to live. It was also at this time that Tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and Boule. He and Tigy remained married until 1949, but it was now a marriage in name only. Despite Tigy's initial protests, Boule remained with the family.
The ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding, the city of La Rochelle eventually honored Simenon, naming a quay after him in 1989. Simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony. However, in 2003, his son Johnny participated in another event honoring his father.
In the United States and Canada, 1945–1955[edit]
Simenon escaped questioning in France and in 1945 arrived, along with Tigy and Marc, in North America. He spent several months in Quebec, Canada, north of Montreal, at Domaine L'Esterel (Ste-Marguerite du Lac Masson) where he lived in a modern-style house and wrote three novels (one of which was Three Bedrooms in Manhattan) in one of the log cabins (LC5, still there today). Boule, due to visa difficulties, was initially unable to join them.
During the years he spent in the United States, Simenon regularly visited New York City. He and his family also went on lengthy car trips, traveling from Maine to Florida and then west as far as California. Simenon lived for a short time on Anna Maria Island near Bradenton, Florida, before renting a house in Nogales, Arizona, where Boule was finally reunited with him. His novel The Bottom of the Bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in Nogales.
Although enchanted by the desert, Simenon decided to leave Arizona, and following a stay in California, settled into a large house, Shadow Rock Farm, in Lakeville, Connecticut. This town forms the background for his 1952 novel La Mort de Belle ("The Death of Belle").
While in the United States, Simenon and his son Marc learned to speak English with relative ease, as did Boule. Tigy, however, had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to Europe.
In the meantime, Simenon had met Denyse Ouimet, a woman seventeen years his junior. Denyse, who was originally from Montréal, met Simenon in New York City in 1945 (she was to be hired as a secretary) and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy relationship. After resolving numerous legal difficulties, Simenon and Tigy were divorced in 1949. Simenon and Denyse Ouimet were then married in Reno, Nevada in 1950 and eventually had three children, Johnny (born in 1949), Marie-Jo (born in 1953) and Pierre (born in 1959). In accordance with the divorce agreement, Tigy continued to live in close proximity to Simenon and their son Marc, an arrangement that continued until they all returned to Europe in 1955.
In 1952, Simenon paid a visit to Belgium and was made a member of the Académie Royale de Belgique. Although he never resided in Belgium after 1922, he remained a Belgian citizen throughout his life.
Return to Europe, 1955–1989[edit]
Simenon and his family returned to Europe in 1955, first living in France (mainly on the Côte d'Azur) before settling in Switzerland. After living in a rented house in Echandens, in 1963 he purchased a property in Epalinges, north of Lausanne, where he had an enormous house constructed to his own design.[2]




Simenon, 1963


Simenon and Denyse Ouimet separated definitively in 1964. Teresa, who had been hired by Simenon as a housekeeper in 1961, had by this time become romantically involved with him and remained his companion for the rest of his life.
His long-troubled daughter Marie-Jo committed suicide in Paris in 1978 at the age of 25,[3] an event that darkened Simenon's later years.
The documentary film The Mirror of Maigret by director/producer John Goldschmidt was filmed at Simenon's villa in Lausanne and was a profile of the man based on his confessional dialogue with a criminal psychologist. The film was made for ATV and shown in the UK on the ITV Network in 1981.
Simenon underwent surgery for a brain tumor in 1984 and made a good recovery. In subsequent years however, his health worsened. He gave his last televised interview in December 1988.
Georges Simenon died in his sleep of natural causes on the night of 3–4 September 1989 in Lausanne.
Simenon left such a legacy that he was honored with a silver commemorative coin: the Belgian 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin, minted in 2003. The obverse side shows his portrait.
In 1977 he claimed that he had had sex with 10,000 women in the 61 years since his 13th birthday.[3]
Works[edit]
Simenon was one of the most prolific writers of the twentieth century, capable of writing 60 to 80 pages per day. His oeuvre includes nearly 200 novels, over 150 novellas, several autobiographical works, numerous articles, and scores of pulp novels written under more than two dozen pseudonyms. Altogether, about 550 million copies of his works have been printed.
He is best known, however, for his 75 novels and 28 short stories featuring Commissaire Maigret. The first novel in the series, Pietr-le-Letton, was serialized in 1930 and appeared in book form in 1931;[7] the last one, Maigret and Monsieur Charles, was published in 1972. The Maigret novels were translated into all major languages and several of them were turned into films and radio plays. Two television series (1960–63 and 1992–93), have been made in Great Britain (the first with Rupert Davies in the title role, the second with Michael Gambon), one in Italy in four different seasons for a total of 36 episodes (1964–72) starring Gino Cervi and two in France: (1967–1990) starring Jean Richard and (1991–2005) starring Bruno Cremer.




The 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin


During his "American" period, Simenon reached the height of his creative powers, and several novels of those years were inspired by the context in which they were written (Trois chambres à Manhattan (1946), Maigret à New York (1947), Maigret se fâche (1947)).
Simenon also wrote a large number of "psychological novels" (what the French refer to as "romans durs"),[8] such as The Strangers in the House (1940), La neige était sale (1948), or Le fils (1957), as well as several autobiographical works, in particular Je me souviens (1945), Pedigree (1948), Mémoires intimes (1981).
In 1966, Simenon was given the MWA's highest honor, the Grand Master Award.
In 2003, the collection La Pléiade (inspiration for the Library of America) has included 21 of Simenon's novels, in 2 volumes. The task of selecting the novels and the preparation of the notes and analyses was performed by two Simenon specialists, Professor Jacques Dubois, president of the Center for Georges Simenon Studies at the Université de Liège, and his assistant Benoît Denis.[9]
According to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Simenon is the seventeenth-most-often-translated author, the most-translated Belgian author.[10]
In 2005, he was nominated for the title of De Grootste Belg / Le plus grand Belge ("The Greatest Belgian") in two separate television shows. In the Flemish version, he ended 77th place. In the Walloon version, he ended 10th place.

What Is Organic? Powerful Players Want a Say

Customers at McDonald's restaurants in New England are about to get something a little different when they order coffee. Through a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and Newman's Own, McDonald's will soon be serving a coffee that comes from organic beans and is certified Fair Trade because it meets higher standards in the treatment of coffee workers.The move, while still a test in a limited region, reflects a much broader trend: The growing interest among large food companies in offering organic foods along with their standard products.General Mills markets the Cascadian Farms and Muir Glen brands; Kraft owns Back to Nature and Boca Foods, which makes soy burgers. Within the last few years, Dean Foods, the dairy giant, has acquired Horizon Organic and White Wave, maker of Silk organic soymilk. Groupe Danone, the French dairy company, owns Stonyfield Farm.Wal-Mart wants in, too. "We are particularly excited about organic food, the fastest-growing category in all of food," Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive, said at a recent shareholder meeting. "It's a great example of how Wal-Mart can appeal to a wider range of customers."

But as organic food enters the mainstream, evolving from an idealistic subculture rooted in images of granola and Birkenstocks, a bitter debate has ensued over what exactly the word "organic" should mean. And now Congress is jumping into the controversy. Continue reading the main story

With sales of roughly $12 billion, organic food remains a niche market within the $500 billion food industry. But the sector's growing appeal to consumers has fueled a 20 percent annual growth rate in recent years, making it highly attractive to food giants looking for gains in a slow-moving business.At General Mills, the Cascadian Farms and Muir Glen brands increased sales by 21 percent in the last year, according to the research firm Information Resources Inc., while the company's overall business was up just 1.6 percent.Consumer groups and some organic pioneers say they are concerned that the movement -- a response to the practices of corporate food production that promotes a natural chemical-free approach to farming -- will become watered down unless firm standards are maintained.The debate has been under way for several years. But last week, Senate and House Republicans on the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee inserted a last-minute provision into the department's fiscal 2006 budget specifying that certain artificial ingredients could be used in organic food.The Organic Trade Association, an industry lobbying group that proposed the amendment and spent several months pushing for its adoption, says that the measure will encourage the continued growth of organic food.Some advocacy groups, however, say the amendment will weaken federal organic food standards, first established under a 1990 law. Ronnie Cummins, national director of the Organic Consumers Association, calls the initiative a "sneak attack engineered by the likes of Kraft, Dean Foods and Smucker's."One of the lobbyists for Altria, Kraft's majority owner, Abigail Blunt -- the wife of Representative Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who recently became interim House majority leader after Tom DeLay of Texas resigned from the post -- has been working on the issue, the company says.

Dean Foods' subsidiary Horizon Organic and the J. M. Smucker Company, the owner of Knudsen and Santa Cruz Organic juices, said they supported the work by the Organic Trade Association, which represents both large and small companies in the business, but did no lobbying on their own.The amendment injects Congress directly into the debate over whether certain artificial ingredients and industrial chemicals should be allowed in products labeled organic. In a lawsuit ruled upon in January, Arthur Harvey, an organic blueberry farmer, argued that no synthetics at all should be in food bearing the "U.S.D.A. Organic" seal. A federal judge agreed, sending shivers down the spine of many organic food manufacturers.Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said that the amendment was intended to protect the industry from the Harvey ruling and will not change the status quo. If applied, the judge's ruling would have forced many manufacturers to stop using the U.S.D.A. Organic seal and instead relabel products to state, for instance, "cookies made with organic flour" or "frozen lasagna made with organic tomatoes."Many in the organic industry say they are willing to allow some use of synthetics in organic food. Since 2002, the National Organic Standards Board, a 15-member panel of advisers appointed by the Agriculture Department, has served as the gatekeeper for such substances. In that time, 38 have been approved, many of them relatively harmless ingredients like baking powder, pectin, ascorbic acid and carbon dioxide.But Joseph Mendelson, legal director at the Center for Food Safety, a liberal advocacy group, says that the proposed legislation will open the door to a range of other chemicals and artificial materials, including a large category of so-called food contact substances -- things like boiler additives, disinfectants and lubricants with unpronounceable names.Most of these substances would not end up in finished products in detectable amounts. But many in the organic community say that these tools of mainstream food processing do not belong in organic production."We don't want organic food manufacturers having carte blanche use of the same kind of synthetics that conventional food processors use, especially when it involves things that do not appear on the ingredient panels," said James A. Riddle, chairman of the National Organic Standards Board. "I think people choose to buy organic food because they don't use all those things."

Ms. DiMatteo contends that the Organic Trade Association is not trying to loosen organic standards or take authority away from the standards board.At the same time, Charles Sweat, chief operating officer at Earthbound Farm, the country's largest grower of organic produce, said he was concerned with the section of the spending bill that gives the Agriculture Department authority to grant temporary exemptions to allow conventionally grown ingredients like corn, soybean oil or tomatoes in organic food when organic versions are not "commercially available."

"We see this as opening up a Pandora's box," Mr. Sweat said. "Any company that can't compete because something is too expensive could go to the secretary and claim they need an exemption."George Simeon, chief executive of Organic Valley, a cooperative of mostly small organic dairy farmers, wrestled with the high cost of organic production a little over a year ago when Wal-Mart asked for a 20 percent price cut. For three years, Organic Valley had been Wal-Mart's primary supplier of organic milk."Wal-Mart allows you to really build market share," Mr. Simeon said. "But we're about our values and being able to sustain our farmers. If a customer wants to stretch us to the point where we're not able to deliver our mission, then we have to find different markets."Mr. Simeon told Wal-Mart to get a new supplier.Dean Foods' Horizon Organic was better equipped to satisfy Wal-Mart's demands. Horizon gets about 20 percent of its production from a 4,000-cow organic dairy in Paul, Idaho, which is small in comparison with many conventional dairy farms but huge by organic standards.Mark Kastel, senior farm policy analyst at Cornucopia, a group representing small dairy farmers, contends that Horizon is able to run such a large farm because it dilutes organic principles. Earlier this year, his group filed a petition arguing that the Idaho farm crams too many cows into a confined area, where most of them do not graze on pasture but instead consume a high-grain diet."These factory farms are trying to cut corners," Mr. Kastel said. "When you feed more calorie-dense grains, you get more milk."Horizon, which also buys milk from 305 family farms, says it is making changes and will divide its Idaho operation into two separate farms so that there will be three to five cows for each acre of pasture."We want to meet the regulations," said Kelly O'Shea, Horizon's director of government and industry relations, "and see integrity in the organic standards."

The National Organic Standards Board has been trying to persuade the Agriculture Department to clarify its vague rule that to produce organic milk, dairy cows, besides receiving only organic feed and avoiding growth hormones and antibiotics, must have "access to pasture." It wants to require that milk labeled organic come from cows that get at least 30 percent of their diet from pasture grass for a minimum of 120 days a year.Mr. Kastel of Cornucopia estimates that roughly 30 percent of the organic milk sold in the United States comes from cows that are not on pasture, most of them from two large dairies run by Aurora Organic Dairy, an offshoot of what was once the country's largest conventional dairy company. Organic milk is the most popular organic product and sells for up to twice the price of regular milk.On a recent visit to Aurora's farm in Platteville, Colo., at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, thousands of Holsteins were seen confined to grassless, dirt-lined pens and eating from a long trough filled with 55 percent hay and 45 percent grains, mostly corn and soybeans.Of the 5,200 cows on the farm, just a few hundred -- those between milking cycles or near the end of their lactation -- were sitting or grazing on small patches of pasture.Aurora executives say that despite the lack of pasture, their cows are "very healthy and happy." The 10 million gallons of milk the farm produces each year are supplied mainly to supermarkets and sold under store brands like Safeway Select, Kirkland at Costco and Archer Farms at Target.Mark Retzloff, president of Aurora Organic, said he did not agree with the National Organic Standards Board's proposed pasture rule, but added that he was planning to add 550 acres of grazing land to the farm. The company is also building a new dairy in a layout that Mr. Retzloff said would be conducive to putting thousands of cows on pasture and still milking them three times a day.Such tensions are likely to remain whatever the new legislation allows. Sheryl O'Laughlin, chief executive of Clif Bar, which makes organic energy bars, says that while the difficulty of operating organically and finding natural ingredients often ends up raising production costs, it is also what gives the category its purity and its appeal."The organic industry," Ms. O'Laughlin said, "has got to put pressure on itself to find alternative solutions."

Early life and education[edit]
Georges Simenon was born at 26 rue Léopold (now number 24) in Liège to Désiré Simenon and his wife Henriette. Désiré Simenon worked in an accounting office at an insurance company and had married Henriette in April 1902. Although Georges Simenon was born on Friday 13 February 1903[2] superstition resulted in his birth being registered as having been on the 12th.[3] This story of his birth is recounted at the beginning of his novel Pedigree.




26 rue Léopold, the house where Simenon was born


The Simenon family traces its origins back to the Limburg region, his mother's family being from Dutch Limburg.[citation needed] His mother had origins from both the Netherlands and Germany while his father was of Walloon origins.[4] One of her more notorious ancestors was Gabriel Brühl, a criminal who preyed on Limburg from the 1720s until he was hanged in 1743. Later, Simenon would use Brühl as one of his many pen names.[citation needed]
In April 1905, two years after Georges Simenon's birth, the family moved to 3 rue Pasteur (now 25 rue Georges Simenon) in Liège's Outremeuse (fr) neighborhood. Georges Simenon's brother Christian was born in September 1906 and eventually became their mother's favorite child, much to Georges Simenon's chagrin. Later, in February 1911, the Simenons moved to 53 rue de la Loi, also in the Outremeuse. In this larger home, the Simenons were able to take in lodgers. Typical among them were apprentices and students of various nationalities, giving the young Simenon an important introduction to the wider world; this marked his novels, notably Pedigree and Le Locataire.
At the age of three, Simenon learned to read at the Saint-Julienne nursery school. Then, between 1908 and 1914, he attended the Institut Saint-André. In September 1914, shortly after the beginning of the First World War, he began his studies at the Collège Saint-Louis, a Jesuit high school.
In February 1917, the Simenon family moved to a former post office building in the Amercoeur neighborhood. June 1919 saw another move, this time to the rue de l'Enseignement, back in the Outremeuse neighborhood.
Using his father's heart condition as a pretext, Simenon decided to put an end to his studies in June 1918, not even taking the Collège Saint-Louis' year-end exams. He subsequently worked a number of very short-term odd jobs.
Career beginnings[edit]
In January 1919, the 15-year-old Simenon took a job at the Gazette de Liège,[4] a newspaper edited by Joseph Demarteau. While Simenon's own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories, it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city, including politics, bars, and cheap hotels but also crime, police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist Edmond Locard. Simenon's experience at the Gazette also taught him the art of quick editing. He wrote more than 150 articles under the pen name "G. Sim."[citation needed] He began submitting stories to Le Matin in the early 1920s.[5]
Simenon's first novel, Au Pont des Arches, was written in June 1919 and published in 1921 under his "G. Sim" pseudonym. Writing as "Monsieur Le Coq", he also published more than 800 humorous pieces between November 1919 and December 1922.[citation needed] He stopped writing for the Gazette in December 1922.[4]
During this period, Simenon's familiarity with nightlife, prostitutes, drunkenness and carousing increased. The people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists, bohemian artists and even two future murderers, the latter appearing in his novel Les Trois crimes de mes amis. He also frequented a group of artists known as "La Caque". While not really involved in the group, he did meet his future wife Régine Renchon through it.
From 1921 to 1934 he used a total of 17 pen names while writing 358 novels and short stories.[5]
In France, 1922–1945[edit]
Simenon's father died in 1922 and this served as the occasion for the author to move to Paris with Régine Renchon (hereafter referred to by her nickname "Tigy"), at first living in the 17th arrondissement, not far from the Boulevard des Batignolles. He became familiar with the city, its bistros, cheap hotels, bars and restaurants. More importantly, he also came to know ordinary working-class Parisians. Writing under numerous pseudonyms, he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends.
Simenon and Tigy returned briefly to Liège in March 1923 to marry. Despite his Catholic upbringing, Simenon was not a believer. Tigy came from a thoroughly non-religious family. However, Simenon's mother insisted on a church wedding, forcing Tigy to become a nominal convert, learning the Catholic Church's catechism. Despite their father's lack of religious convictions, all of Simenon's children would be baptized as Catholics. Marriage to Tigy, however, did not prevent Simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women, perhaps most famously, Josephine Baker.
A reporting assignment had Simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in 1928, giving him a taste for boating. In 1929, he decided to have a boat built, the Ostrogoth. Simenon, Tigy, their cook and housekeeper Henriette Liberge, and their dog Olaf lived on board the Ostrogoth, travelling the French canal system. Henriette Liberge, known as "Boule" (literally "Ball," a reference to her slight pudginess) was romantically involved with Simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family, really part of it.[6]

In 1930, the most famous character invented by Simenon, Commissaire Maigret, made his first appearance in a piece in Detective written at Joseph Kessel's request. This first ever Maigret detective story was written while boating in The Netherlands, particularly in and around the Dutch town of Delfzijl. A statue of Maigret in Delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this.
1932 saw Simenon travel extensively, sending back reports from Africa, eastern Europe, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. A trip around the world followed in 1934 and 1935.
Between 1932 and 1936, Simenon, Tigy, and Boule lived at La Richardière, a 16th-century manor house in Marsilly at the Charente-Maritime département. The house is evoked in Simenon's novel Le Testament Donadieu. At the beginning of 1938, he rented the villa Agnès in La Rochelle, and published La Suspect, and then, in August, purchased a farm house in Nieul-sur-Mer (also in the Charente-Maritime) where his and Tigy's only child, Marc, was born in 1939.
Simenon lived in the Vendée during the Second World War.[3] Simenon's conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy, with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the Germans while others disagree, viewing Simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator. Further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the Gestapo suspected him of being Jewish, apparently conflating the names "Simenon" and "Simon". In any case, Simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with German studios during the occupation and in 1950 was sentenced to a five-year period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work. This sentence, however, was kept from the public and had little practical effect.
The war years did see Simenon produce a number of important works, including Le Testament Donadieu, Le Voyageur de la Toussaint and Le Cercle des Mahé. He also conducted important correspondence, most notably with André Gide.
Also in the early 1940s, Simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition (a reminder of his father), giving him only months to live. It was also at this time that Tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and Boule. He and Tigy remained married until 1949, but it was now a marriage in name only. Despite Tigy's initial protests, Boule remained with the family.
The ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding, the city of La Rochelle eventually honored Simenon, naming a quay after him in 1989. Simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony. However, in 2003, his son Johnny participated in another event honoring his father.
In the United States and Canada, 1945–1955[edit]
Simenon escaped questioning in France and in 1945 arrived, along with Tigy and Marc, in North America. He spent several months in Quebec, Canada, north of Montreal, at Domaine L'Esterel (Ste-Marguerite du Lac Masson) where he lived in a modern-style house and wrote three novels (one of which was Three Bedrooms in Manhattan) in one of the log cabins (LC5, still there today). Boule, due to visa difficulties, was initially unable to join them.
During the years he spent in the United States, Simenon regularly visited New York City. He and his family also went on lengthy car trips, traveling from Maine to Florida and then west as far as California. Simenon lived for a short time on Anna Maria Island near Bradenton, Florida, before renting a house in Nogales, Arizona, where Boule was finally reunited with him. His novel The Bottom of the Bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in Nogales.
Although enchanted by the desert, Simenon decided to leave Arizona, and following a stay in California, settled into a large house, Shadow Rock Farm, in Lakeville, Connecticut. This town forms the background for his 1952 novel La Mort de Belle ("The Death of Belle").
While in the United States, Simenon and his son Marc learned to speak English with relative ease, as did Boule. Tigy, however, had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to Europe.
In the meantime, Simenon had met Denyse Ouimet, a woman seventeen years his junior. Denyse, who was originally from Montréal, met Simenon in New York City in 1945 (she was to be hired as a secretary) and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy relationship. After resolving numerous legal difficulties, Simenon and Tigy were divorced in 1949. Simenon and Denyse Ouimet were then married in Reno, Nevada in 1950 and eventually had three children, Johnny (born in 1949), Marie-Jo (born in 1953) and Pierre (born in 1959). In accordance with the divorce agreement, Tigy continued to live in close proximity to Simenon and their son Marc, an arrangement that continued until they all returned to Europe in 1955.
In 1952, Simenon paid a visit to Belgium and was made a member of the Académie Royale de Belgique. Although he never resided in Belgium after 1922, he remained a Belgian citizen throughout his life.
Return to Europe, 1955–1989[edit]
Simenon and his family returned to Europe in 1955, first living in France (mainly on the Côte d'Azur) before settling in Switzerland. After living in a rented house in Echandens, in 1963 he purchased a property in Epalinges, north of Lausanne, where he had an enormous house constructed to his own design.[2]




Simenon, 1963


Simenon and Denyse Ouimet separated definitively in 1964. Teresa, who had been hired by Simenon as a housekeeper in 1961, had by this time become romantically involved with him and remained his companion for the rest of his life.
His long-troubled daughter Marie-Jo committed suicide in Paris in 1978 at the age of 25,[3] an event that darkened Simenon's later years.
The documentary film The Mirror of Maigret by director/producer John Goldschmidt was filmed at Simenon's villa in Lausanne and was a profile of the man based on his confessional dialogue with a criminal psychologist. The film was made for ATV and shown in the UK on the ITV Network in 1981.
Simenon underwent surgery for a brain tumor in 1984 and made a good recovery. In subsequent years however, his health worsened. He gave his last televised interview in December 1988.
Georges Simenon died in his sleep of natural causes on the night of 3–4 September 1989 in Lausanne.
Simenon left such a legacy that he was honored with a silver commemorative coin: the Belgian 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin, minted in 2003. The obverse side shows his portrait.
In 1977 he claimed that he had had sex with 10,000 women in the 61 years since his 13th birthday.[3]
Works[edit]
Simenon was one of the most prolific writers of the twentieth century, capable of writing 60 to 80 pages per day. His oeuvre includes nearly 200 novels, over 150 novellas, several autobiographical works, numerous articles, and scores of pulp novels written under more than two dozen pseudonyms. Altogether, about 550 million copies of his works have been printed.
He is best known, however, for his 75 novels and 28 short stories featuring Commissaire Maigret. The first novel in the series, Pietr-le-Letton, was serialized in 1930 and appeared in book form in 1931;[7] the last one, Maigret and Monsieur Charles, was published in 1972. The Maigret novels were translated into all major languages and several of them were turned into films and radio plays. Two television series (1960–63 and 1992–93), have been made in Great Britain (the first with Rupert Davies in the title role, the second with Michael Gambon), one in Italy in four different seasons for a total of 36 episodes (1964–72) starring Gino Cervi and two in France: (1967–1990) starring Jean Richard and (1991–2005) starring Bruno Cremer.




The 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin


During his "American" period, Simenon reached the height of his creative powers, and several novels of those years were inspired by the context in which they were written (Trois chambres à Manhattan (1946), Maigret à New York (1947), Maigret se fâche (1947)).
Simenon also wrote a large number of "psychological novels" (what the French refer to as "romans durs"),[8] such as The Strangers in the House (1940), La neige était sale (1948), or Le fils (1957), as well as several autobiographical works, in particular Je me souviens (1945), Pedigree (1948), Mémoires intimes (1981).
In 1966, Simenon was given the MWA's highest honor, the Grand Master Award.
In 2003, the collection La Pléiade (inspiration for the Library of America) has included 21 of Simenon's novels, in 2 volumes. The task of selecting the novels and the preparation of the notes and analyses was performed by two Simenon specialists, Professor Jacques Dubois, president of the Center for Georges Simenon Studies at the Université de Liège, and his assistant Benoît Denis.[9]
According to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Simenon is the seventeenth-most-often-translated author, the most-translated Belgian author.[10]
In 2005, he was nominated for the title of De Grootste Belg / Le plus grand Belge ("The Greatest Belgian") in two separate television shows. In the Flemish version, he ended 77th place. In the Walloon version, he ended 10th place.

Early life and education[edit]
Georges Simenon was born at 26 rue Léopold (now number 24) in Liège to Désiré Simenon and his wife Henriette. Désiré Simenon worked in an accounting office at an insurance company and had married Henriette in April 1902. Although Georges Simenon was born on Friday 13 February 1903[2] superstition resulted in his birth being registered as having been on the 12th.[3] This story of his birth is recounted at the beginning of his novel Pedigree.




26 rue Léopold, the house where Simenon was born


The Simenon family traces its origins back to the Limburg region, his mother's family being from Dutch Limburg.[citation needed] His mother had origins from both the Netherlands and Germany while his father was of Walloon origins.[4] One of her more notorious ancestors was Gabriel Brühl, a criminal who preyed on Limburg from the 1720s until he was hanged in 1743. Later, Simenon would use Brühl as one of his many pen names.[citation needed]
In April 1905, two years after Georges Simenon's birth, the family moved to 3 rue Pasteur (now 25 rue Georges Simenon) in Liège's Outremeuse (fr) neighborhood. Georges Simenon's brother Christian was born in September 1906 and eventually became their mother's favorite child, much to Georges Simenon's chagrin. Later, in February 1911, the Simenons moved to 53 rue de la Loi, also in the Outremeuse. In this larger home, the Simenons were able to take in lodgers. Typical among them were apprentices and students of various nationalities, giving the young Simenon an important introduction to the wider world; this marked his novels, notably Pedigree and Le Locataire.
At the age of three, Simenon learned to read at the Saint-Julienne nursery school. Then, between 1908 and 1914, he attended the Institut Saint-André. In September 1914, shortly after the beginning of the First World War, he began his studies at the Collège Saint-Louis, a Jesuit high school.
In February 1917, the Simenon family moved to a former post office building in the Amercoeur neighborhood. June 1919 saw another move, this time to the rue de l'Enseignement, back in the Outremeuse neighborhood.
Using his father's heart condition as a pretext, Simenon decided to put an end to his studies in June 1918, not even taking the Collège Saint-Louis' year-end exams. He subsequently worked a number of very short-term odd jobs.
Career beginnings[edit]
In January 1919, the 15-year-old Simenon took a job at the Gazette de Liège,[4] a newspaper edited by Joseph Demarteau. While Simenon's own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories, it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city, including politics, bars, and cheap hotels but also crime, police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist Edmond Locard. Simenon's experience at the Gazette also taught him the art of quick editing. He wrote more than 150 articles under the pen name "G. Sim."[citation needed] He began submitting stories to Le Matin in the early 1920s.[5]
Simenon's first novel, Au Pont des Arches, was written in June 1919 and published in 1921 under his "G. Sim" pseudonym. Writing as "Monsieur Le Coq", he also published more than 800 humorous pieces between November 1919 and December 1922.[citation needed] He stopped writing for the Gazette in December 1922.[4]
During this period, Simenon's familiarity with nightlife, prostitutes, drunkenness and carousing increased. The people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists, bohemian artists and even two future murderers, the latter appearing in his novel Les Trois crimes de mes amis. He also frequented a group of artists known as "La Caque". While not really involved in the group, he did meet his future wife Régine Renchon through it.
From 1921 to 1934 he used a total of 17 pen names while writing 358 novels and short stories.[5]
In France, 1922–1945[edit]
Simenon's father died in 1922 and this served as the occasion for the author to move to Paris with Régine Renchon (hereafter referred to by her nickname "Tigy"), at first living in the 17th arrondissement, not far from the Boulevard des Batignolles. He became familiar with the city, its bistros, cheap hotels, bars and restaurants. More importantly, he also came to know ordinary working-class Parisians. Writing under numerous pseudonyms, he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends.
Simenon and Tigy returned briefly to Liège in March 1923 to marry. Despite his Catholic upbringing, Simenon was not a believer. Tigy came from a thoroughly non-religious family. However, Simenon's mother insisted on a church wedding, forcing Tigy to become a nominal convert, learning the Catholic Church's catechism. Despite their father's lack of religious convictions, all of Simenon's children would be baptized as Catholics. Marriage to Tigy, however, did not prevent Simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women, perhaps most famously, Josephine Baker.
A reporting assignment had Simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in 1928, giving him a taste for boating. In 1929, he decided to have a boat built, the Ostrogoth. Simenon, Tigy, their cook and housekeeper Henriette Liberge, and their dog Olaf lived on board the Ostrogoth, travelling the French canal system. Henriette Liberge, known as "Boule" (literally "Ball," a reference to her slight pudginess) was romantically involved with Simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family, really part of it.[6]




Maigret statue in Delfzijl


In 1930, the most famous character invented by Simenon, Commissaire Maigret, made his first appearance in a piece in Detective written at Joseph Kessel's request. This first ever Maigret detective story was written while boating in The Netherlands, particularly in and around the Dutch town of Delfzijl. A statue of Maigret in Delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this.
1932 saw Simenon travel extensively, sending back reports from Africa, eastern Europe, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. A trip around the world followed in 1934 and 1935.
Between 1932 and 1936, Simenon, Tigy, and Boule lived at La Richardière, a 16th-century manor house in Marsilly at the Charente-Maritime département. The house is evoked in Simenon's novel Le Testament Donadieu. At the beginning of 1938, he rented the villa Agnès in La Rochelle, and published La Suspect, and then, in August, purchased a farm house in Nieul-sur-Mer (also in the Charente-Maritime) where his and Tigy's only child, Marc, was born in 1939.
Simenon lived in the Vendée during the Second World War.[3] Simenon's conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy, with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the Germans while others disagree, viewing Simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator. Further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the Gestapo suspected him of being Jewish, apparently conflating the names "Simenon" and "Simon". In any case, Simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with German studios during the occupation and in 1950 was sentenced to a five-year period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work. This sentence, however, was kept from the public and had little practical effect.
The war years did see Simenon produce a number of important works, including Le Testament Donadieu, Le Voyageur de la Toussaint and Le Cercle des Mahé. He also conducted important correspondence, most notably with André Gide.
Also in the early 1940s, Simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition (a reminder of his father), giving him only months to live. It was also at this time that Tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and Boule. He and Tigy remained married until 1949, but it was now a marriage in name only. Despite Tigy's initial protests, Boule remained with the family.
The ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding, the city of La Rochelle eventually honored Simenon, naming a quay after him in 1989. Simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony. However, in 2003, his son Johnny participated in another event honoring his father.
In the United States and Canada, 1945–1955[edit]
Simenon escaped questioning in France and in 1945 arrived, along with Tigy and Marc, in North America. He spent several months in Quebec, Canada, north of Montreal, at Domaine L'Esterel (Ste-Marguerite du Lac Masson) where he lived in a modern-style house and wrote three novels (one of which was Three Bedrooms in Manhattan) in one of the log cabins (LC5, still there today). Boule, due to visa difficulties, was initially unable to join them.
During the years he spent in the United States, Simenon regularly visited New York City. He and his family also went on lengthy car trips, traveling from Maine to Florida and then west as far as California. Simenon lived for a short time on Anna Maria Island near Bradenton, Florida, before renting a house in Nogales, Arizona, where Boule was finally reunited with him. His novel The Bottom of the Bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in Nogales.
Although enchanted by the desert, Simenon decided to leave Arizona, and following a stay in California, settled into a large house, Shadow Rock Farm, in Lakeville, Connecticut. This town forms the background for his 1952 novel La Mort de Belle ("The Death of Belle").
While in the United States, Simenon and his son Marc learned to speak English with relative ease, as did Boule. Tigy, however, had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to Europe.
In the meantime, Simenon had met Denyse Ouimet, a woman seventeen years his junior. Denyse, who was originally from Montréal, met Simenon in New York City in 1945 (she was to be hired as a secretary) and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy relationship. After resolving numerous legal difficulties, Simenon and Tigy were divorced in 1949. Simenon and Denyse Ouimet were then married in Reno, Nevada in 1950 and eventually had three children, Johnny (born in 1949), Marie-Jo (born in 1953) and Pierre (born in 1959). In accordance with the divorce agreement, Tigy continued to live in close proximity to Simenon and their son Marc, an arrangement that continued until they all returned to Europe in 1955.
In 1952, Simenon paid a visit to Belgium and was made a member of the Académie Royale de Belgique. Although he never resided in Belgium after 1922, he remained a Belgian citizen throughout his life.
Return to Europe, 1955–1989[edit]
Simenon and his family returned to Europe in 1955, first living in France (mainly on the Côte d'Azur) before settling in Switzerland. After living in a rented house in Echandens, in 1963 he purchased a property in Epalinges, north of Lausanne, where he had an enormous house constructed to his own design.[2]




Simenon, 1963


Simenon and Denyse Ouimet separated definitively in 1964. Teresa, who had been hired by Simenon as a housekeeper in 1961, had by this time become romantically involved with him and remained his companion for the rest of his life.
His long-troubled daughter Marie-Jo committed suicide in Paris in 1978 at the age of 25,[3] an event that darkened Simenon's later years.
The documentary film The Mirror of Maigret by director/producer John Goldschmidt was filmed at Simenon's villa in Lausanne and was a profile of the man based on his confessional dialogue with a criminal psychologist. The film was made for ATV and shown in the UK on the ITV Network in 1981.
Simenon underwent surgery for a brain tumor in 1984 and made a good recovery. In subsequent years however, his health worsened. He gave his last televised interview in December 1988.
Georges Simenon died in his sleep of natural causes on the night of 3–4 September 1989 in Lausanne.
Simenon left such a legacy that he was honored with a silver commemorative coin: the Belgian 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin, minted in 2003. The obverse side shows his portrait.
In 1977 he claimed that he had had sex with 10,000 women in the 61 years since his 13th birthday.[3]
Works[edit]
Simenon was one of the most prolific writers of the twentieth century, capable of writing 60 to 80 pages per day. His oeuvre includes nearly 200 novels, over 150 novellas, several autobiographical works, numerous articles, and scores of pulp novels written under more than two dozen pseudonyms. Altogether, about 550 million copies of his works have been printed.
He is best known, however, for his 75 novels and 28 short stories featuring Commissaire Maigret. The first novel in the series, Pietr-le-Letton, was serialized in 1930 and appeared in book form in 1931;[7] the last one, Maigret and Monsieur Charles, was published in 1972. The Maigret novels were translated into all major languages and several of them were turned into films and radio plays. Two television series (1960–63 and 1992–93), have been made in Great Britain (the first with Rupert Davies in the title role, the second with Michael Gambon), one in Italy in four different seasons for a total of 36 episodes (1964–72) starring Gino Cervi and two in France: (1967–1990) starring Jean Richard and (1991–2005) starring Bruno Cremer.




The 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin


During his "American" period, Simenon reached the height of his creative powers, and several novels of those years were inspired by the context in which they were written (Trois chambres à Manhattan (1946), Maigret à New York (1947), Maigret se fâche (1947)).
Simenon also wrote a large number of "psychological novels" (what the French refer to as "romans durs"),[8] such as The Strangers in the House (1940), La neige était sale (1948), or Le fils (1957), as well as several autobiographical works, in particular Je me souviens (1945), Pedigree (1948), Mémoires intimes (1981).
In 1966, Simenon was given the MWA's highest honor, the Grand Master Award.
In 2003, the collection La Pléiade (inspiration for the Library of America) has included 21 of Simenon's novels, in 2 volumes. The task of selecting the novels and the preparation of the notes and analyses was performed by two Simenon specialists, Professor Jacques Dubois, president of the Center for Georges Simenon Studies at the Université de Liège, and his assistant Benoît Denis.[9]
According to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Simenon is the seventeenth-most-often-translated author, the most-translated Belgian author.[10]
In 2005, he was nominated for the title of De Grootste Belg / Le plus grand Belge ("The Greatest Belgian") in two separate television shows. In the Flemish version, he ended 77th place. In the Walloon version, he ended 10th place.

Early life and education[edit]
Georges Simenon was born at 26 rue Léopold (now number 24) in Liège to Désiré Simenon and his wife Henriette. Désiré Simenon worked in an accounting office at an insurance company and had married Henriette in April 1902. Although Georges Simenon was born on Friday 13 February 1903[2] superstition resulted in his birth being registered as having been on the 12th.[3] This story of his birth is recounted at the beginning of his novel Pedigree.




26 rue Léopold, the house where Simenon was born


The Simenon family traces its origins back to the Limburg region, his mother's family being from Dutch Limburg.[citation needed] His mother had origins from both the Netherlands and Germany while his father was of Walloon origins.[4] One of her more notorious ancestors was Gabriel Brühl, a criminal who preyed on Limburg from the 1720s until he was hanged in 1743. Later, Simenon would use Brühl as one of his many pen names.[citation needed]
In April 1905, two years after Georges Simenon's birth, the family moved to 3 rue Pasteur (now 25 rue Georges Simenon) in Liège's Outremeuse (fr) neighborhood. Georges Simenon's brother Christian was born in September 1906 and eventually became their mother's favorite child, much to Georges Simenon's chagrin. Later, in February 1911, the Simenons moved to 53 rue de la Loi, also in the Outremeuse. In this larger home, the Simenons were able to take in lodgers. Typical among them were apprentices and students of various nationalities, giving the young Simenon an important introduction to the wider world; this marked his novels, notably Pedigree and Le Locataire.
At the age of three, Simenon learned to read at the Saint-Julienne nursery school. Then, between 1908 and 1914, he attended the Institut Saint-André. In September 1914, shortly after the beginning of the First World War, he began his studies at the Collège Saint-Louis, a Jesuit high school.
In February 1917, the Simenon family moved to a former post office building in the Amercoeur neighborhood. June 1919 saw another move, this time to the rue de l'Enseignement, back in the Outremeuse neighborhood.
Using his father's heart condition as a pretext, Simenon decided to put an end to his studies in June 1918, not even taking the Collège Saint-Louis' year-end exams. He subsequently worked a number of very short-term odd jobs.
Career beginnings[edit]
In January 1919, the 15-year-old Simenon took a job at the Gazette de Liège,[4] a newspaper edited by Joseph Demarteau. While Simenon's own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories, it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city, including politics, bars, and cheap hotels but also crime, police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist Edmond Locard. Simenon's experience at the Gazette also taught him the art of quick editing. He wrote more than 150 articles under the pen name "G. Sim."[citation needed] He began submitting stories to Le Matin in the early 1920s.[5]
Simenon's first novel, Au Pont des Arches, was written in June 1919 and published in 1921 under his "G. Sim" pseudonym. Writing as "Monsieur Le Coq", he also published more than 800 humorous pieces between November 1919 and December 1922.[citation needed] He stopped writing for the Gazette in December 1922.[4]
During this period, Simenon's familiarity with nightlife, prostitutes, drunkenness and carousing increased. The people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists, bohemian artists and even two future murderers, the latter appearing in his novel Les Trois crimes de mes amis. He also frequented a group of artists known as "La Caque". While not really involved in the group, he did meet his future wife Régine Renchon through it.
From 1921 to 1934 he used a total of 17 pen names while writing 358 novels and short stories.[5]
In France, 1922–1945[edit]
Simenon's father died in 1922 and this served as the occasion for the author to move to Paris with Régine Renchon (hereafter referred to by her nickname "Tigy"), at first living in the 17th arrondissement, not far from the Boulevard des Batignolles. He became familiar with the city, its bistros, cheap hotels, bars and restaurants. More importantly, he also came to know ordinary working-class Parisians. Writing under numerous pseudonyms, he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends.
Simenon and Tigy returned briefly to Liège in March 1923 to marry. Despite his Catholic upbringing, Simenon was not a believer. Tigy came from a thoroughly non-religious family. However, Simenon's mother insisted on a church wedding, forcing Tigy to become a nominal convert, learning the Catholic Church's catechism. Despite their father's lack of religious convictions, all of Simenon's children would be baptized as Catholics. Marriage to Tigy, however, did not prevent Simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women, perhaps most famously, Josephine Baker.
A reporting assignment had Simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in 1928, giving him a taste for boating. In 1929, he decided to have a boat built, the Ostrogoth. Simenon, Tigy, their cook and housekeeper Henriette Liberge, and their dog Olaf lived on board the Ostrogoth, travelling the French canal system. Henriette Liberge, known as "Boule" (literally "Ball," a reference to her slight pudginess) was romantically involved with Simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family, really part of it.[6]




Maigret statue in Delfzijl


In 1930, the most famous character invented by Simenon, Commissaire Maigret, made his first appearance in a piece in Detective written at Joseph Kessel's request. This first ever Maigret detective story was written while boating in The Netherlands, particularly in and around the Dutch town of Delfzijl. A statue of Maigret in Delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this.
1932 saw Simenon travel extensively, sending back reports from Africa, eastern Europe, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. A trip around the world followed in 1934 and 1935.
Between 1932 and 1936, Simenon, Tigy, and Boule lived at La Richardière, a 16th-century manor house in Marsilly at the Charente-Maritime département. The house is evoked in Simenon's novel Le Testament Donadieu. At the beginning of 1938, he rented the villa Agnès in La Rochelle, and published La Suspect, and then, in August, purchased a farm house in Nieul-sur-Mer (also in the Charente-Maritime) where his and Tigy's only child, Marc, was born in 1939.
Simenon lived in the Vendée during the Second World War.[3] Simenon's conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy, with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the Germans while others disagree, viewing Simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator. Further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the Gestapo suspected him of being Jewish, apparently conflating the names "Simenon" and "Simon". In any case, Simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with German studios during the occupation and in 1950 was sentenced to a five-year period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work. This sentence, however, was kept from the public and had little practical effect.
The war years did see Simenon produce a number of important works, including Le Testament Donadieu, Le Voyageur de la Toussaint and Le Cercle des Mahé. He also conducted important correspondence, most notably with André Gide.
Also in the early 1940s, Simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition (a reminder of his father), giving him only months to live. It was also at this time that Tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and Boule. He and Tigy remained married until 1949, but it was now a marriage in name only. Despite Tigy's initial protests, Boule remained with the family.
The ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding, the city of La Rochelle eventually honored Simenon, naming a quay after him in 1989. Simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony. However, in 2003, his son Johnny participated in another event honoring his father.
In the United States and Canada, 1945–1955[edit]
Simenon escaped questioning in France and in 1945 arrived, along with Tigy and Marc, in North America. He spent several months in Quebec, Canada, north of Montreal, at Domaine L'Esterel (Ste-Marguerite du Lac Masson) where he lived in a modern-style house and wrote three novels (one of which was Three Bedrooms in Manhattan) in one of the log cabins (LC5, still there today). Boule, due to visa difficulties, was initially unable to join them.
During the years he spent in the United States, Simenon regularly visited New York City. He and his family also went on lengthy car trips, traveling from Maine to Florida and then west as far as California. Simenon lived for a short time on Anna Maria Island near Bradenton, Florida, before renting a house in Nogales, Arizona, where Boule was finally reunited with him. His novel The Bottom of the Bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in Nogales.
Although enchanted by the desert, Simenon decided to leave Arizona, and following a stay in California, settled into a large house, Shadow Rock Farm, in Lakeville, Connecticut. This town forms the background for his 1952 novel La Mort de Belle ("The Death of Belle").
While in the United States, Simenon and his son Marc learned to speak English with relative ease, as did Boule. Tigy, however, had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to Europe.
In the meantime, Simenon had met Denyse Ouimet, a woman seventeen years his junior. Denyse, who was originally from Montréal, met Simenon in New York City in 1945 (she was to be hired as a secretary) and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy relationship. After resolving numerous legal difficulties, Simenon and Tigy were divorced in 1949. Simenon and Denyse Ouimet were then married in Reno, Nevada in 1950 and eventually had three children, Johnny (born in 1949), Marie-Jo (born in 1953) and Pierre (born in 1959). In accordance with the divorce agreement, Tigy continued to live in close proximity to Simenon and their son Marc, an arrangement that continued until they all returned to Europe in 1955.
In 1952, Simenon paid a visit to Belgium and was made a member of the Académie Royale de Belgique. Although he never resided in Belgium after 1922, he remained a Belgian citizen throughout his life.
Return to Europe, 1955–1989[edit]
Simenon and his family returned to Europe in 1955, first living in France (mainly on the Côte d'Azur) before settling in Switzerland. After living in a rented house in Echandens, in 1963 he purchased a property in Epalinges, north of Lausanne, where he had an enormous house constructed to his own design.[2]




Simenon, 1963


Simenon and Denyse Ouimet separated definitively in 1964. Teresa, who had been hired by Simenon as a housekeeper in 1961, had by this time become romantically involved with him and remained his companion for the rest of his life.
His long-troubled daughter Marie-Jo committed suicide in Paris in 1978 at the age of 25,[3] an event that darkened Simenon's later years.
The documentary film The Mirror of Maigret by director/producer John Goldschmidt was filmed at Simenon's villa in Lausanne and was a profile of the man based on his confessional dialogue with a criminal psychologist. The film was made for ATV and shown in the UK on the ITV Network in 1981.
Simenon underwent surgery for a brain tumor in 1984 and made a good recovery. In subsequent years however, his health worsened. He gave his last televised interview in December 1988.
Georges Simenon died in his sleep of natural causes on the night of 3–4 September 1989 in Lausanne.
Simenon left such a legacy that he was honored with a silver commemorative coin: the Belgian 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin, minted in 2003. The obverse side shows his portrait.
In 1977 he claimed that he had had sex with 10,000 women in the 61 years since his 13th birthday.[3]
Works[edit]
Simenon was one of the most prolific writers of the twentieth century, capable of writing 60 to 80 pages per day. His oeuvre includes nearly 200 novels, over 150 novellas, several autobiographical works, numerous articles, and scores of pulp novels written under more than two dozen pseudonyms. Altogether, about 550 million copies of his works have been printed.
He is best known, however, for his 75 novels and 28 short stories featuring Commissaire Maigret. The first novel in the series, Pietr-le-Letton, was serialized in 1930 and appeared in book form in 1931;[7] the last one, Maigret and Monsieur Charles, was published in 1972. The Maigret novels were translated into all major languages and several of them were turned into films and radio plays. Two television series (1960–63 and 1992–93), have been made in Great Britain (the first with Rupert Davies in the title role, the second with Michael Gambon), one in Italy in four different seasons for a total of 36 episodes (1964–72) starring Gino Cervi and two in France: (1967–1990) starring Jean Richard and (1991–2005) starring Bruno Cremer.




The 100 Years of Georges Simenon coin


During his "American" period, Simenon reached the height of his creative powers, and several novels of those years were inspired by the context in which they were written (Trois chambres à Manhattan (1946), Maigret à New York (1947), Maigret se fâche (1947)).
Simenon also wrote a large number of "psychological novels" (what the French refer to as "romans durs"),[8] such as The Strangers in the House (1940), La neige était sale (1948), or Le fils (1957), as well as several autobiographical works, in particular Je me souviens (1945), Pedigree (1948), Mémoires intimes (1981).
In 1966, Simenon was given the MWA's highest honor, the Grand Master Award.
In 2003, the collection La Pléiade (inspiration for the Library of America) has included 21 of Simenon's novels, in 2 volumes. The task of selecting the novels and the preparation of the notes and analyses was performed by two Simenon specialists, Professor Jacques Dubois, president of the Center for Georges Simenon Studies at the Université de Liège, and his assistant Benoît Denis.[9]
According to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Simenon is the seventeenth-most-often-translated author, the most-translated Belgian author.[10]
In 2005, he was nominated for the title of De Grootste Belg / Le plus grand Belge ("The Greatest Belgian") in two separate television shows. In the Flemish version, he ended 77th place. In the Walloon version, he ended 10th place.

CROPP Cooperative

May 1999
Interview with: George Simeon, CEO; Theresa Marquez, Director of Marketing; Jim Wedeberg, Dairy Pool Coordinator; Pam Saunders, Meat Pool Coordinator; and Robert Koch, Produce Marketing Coordinator.
Goal: Secure stable, profitable prices for small-scale producers through development of new markets for organic dairy, vegetable, and meat products.
Date Established: February 1988
Area Served: United States
Number of Members: 170
Key Challenges: Cash flow and equity financing
Helpful Resources: National Farmers Organization, Cooperative Development Services, Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives, Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research, USDA Rural Development Division.

During the farm financial crisis of the late 1980s, 
	producers responded to depressed commodity 
	prices and federal program changes with a range of solutions.  Some farmers organized a call for enhanced government assistance while others quietly tried to survive by taking off-farm employment.  Elsewhere, in Wisconsin's Coulee region, 35 farmers conceived of a pooled marketing cooperative that could promote sales of premium organic products and secure stable prices for its members.  This group of farmers formed the Coulee Region Organic Produce Pool (CROPP) in February 1988 and is now the largest farmer-owned organic cooperative in North America, shipping organic dairy, beef, poultry, vegetable, pork, and egg products across the country under its "Organic Valley" label.
Why market collaboratively - 			identifying a need and an opportunity
Throughout the 1980s, many producers in central Wisconsin's Coulee region operated small-scale grain, vegetable, and/or dairy farms that included one to three acres of  tobacco as a cash crop.  When federal programs and prices began to collapse for these and other commodities, many of the area's producers started thinking about a different way to farm and market.  "A lot of the Upper Midwest's small family farmers were on the verge of going out of business," explains CROPP marketing director Theresa Marquez.  "As a last resort, some farmers turned to niche marketing, which in their case meant organic sales."  According to Marquez, many of CROPP's early founders were already farming organically as a way to save money on inputs prior to the Co-op's formation.  "After investigating organic production requirements, a lot of farmers realized that they qualified for organic certification," says Marquez.
In early Fall 1987, 35 Wisconsin farmers, many of whom were producing tobacco and vegetables, began talking seriously about the creation of an organic vegetable and dairy marketing cooperative. The idea for a cooperative structure stemmed from tobacco growers' experience with the Northern Wisconsin Tobacco Cooperative, which pooled tobacco for collective sales.
The primary goal of the Cooperative was to establish and secure a stable target price for members, regardless of commodities produced.   "A target price is different from a premium," explains CROPP's meat pool coordinator Pam Saunders. "A target price is not tied to conventional prices in any way so that it does not fluctuate with that market."  Target prices are just that - price goals established to pay the producer for his/her costs of production plus a profit.  Coupled with profitable pricing goals was the need to build price stability. "Price stability is very important for farm survival," says Saunders.  "Farmers need to be able to plan around a price.  It enables a farmer to make sound production and marketing decisions."   
A second but equally important goal of the proposed cooperative was to create a marketing arm that could develop sales, arrange processing, and distribute products.   The group envisioned hiring staff who could market products on members' behalf.   "Farmers saw the co-op as a bridge between the producer and the consumer," says CROPP cooperative pool manager Jim Wedeberg. 
With these goals firmly in mind, a small steering committee was organized to explore: (1) consumer demand for organic vegetables and milk; (2) processing feasibility; (3) financing options; and (4) distribution alternatives.
Exploration of an idea

Dairy Pricing and Supply Management
A target price of $17.50 per hundredweight was established for fluid milk when CROPP began operations in 1988.  Targets were also set for eggs and meat.  Production quotas, similar to those instituted under the federal tobacco programs, combined with a "last on, first off" principle and alternative pricing incentives were proposed to manage target prices. Under this system, farm member production quotas were established based on equity contributions.  These quotas remained fixed.  According to plans, however, the last member to join a milk route was the first one removed from CROPP's milk pick-up list as a way to manage prices during surplus supply periods.  Likewise, members who remained on the milk pick-up route were required to produce within their quota.  
Individual delivery quota rights, based on the amount of equity contributed by each member, are observed through a price incentive system.  Target prices were and continue to be paid for all milk shipped within quota.   Milk shipped over quota is subject to conventional pricing, although Saunders says that approximately 95 percent of all milk sold to CROPP Cooperative is distributed as organic.

Steering committee members conducted preliminary, informal market research to investigate retail demand for locally produced organic vegetables, fluid milk, and value-added dairy products.  "The group really didn't have much money available for marketing research in the beginning," says Marquez.  "It was also hard to develop consumer demand projections in the organic market at that time since there were no precedents, particularly for dairy products."  Working within their budgets, steering committee members contacted natural foods stores in Madison and Chicago to inquire about demand for a range of fresh, organic vegetables and dairy products.  
A formal prospectus, stating the group's mission, planting intentions, and future product availability, was mailed to retailers and followed up with a phone call.  Although retailers' response was better than expected, buyers were unwilling to sign purchase contracts until vegetables and other products were actually available.  "So we moved ahead with our plans, despite no firm commitments from retailers," recalls CROPP CEO and founding member George Seimon.  "We could have spent another year on business planning, product development, and grower trainings, but we decided to move forward because of the tremendous amount of enthusiasm brewing out in the fields.  With little to lose at that time, farmers wanted to move ahead with the Cooperative."
With potential markets identified, the group next made phone calls to local vegetable distributors to get a feel for wholesale prices, warehouse storage availability, and transportation expenses.  At the same time, the group consulted with another local distributor called North Farm Cooperative, which had already established a market for "natural" cheese.  The distributor was interested in selling organic cheese and therefore agreed to package and market all the organic cheddar cheese that CROPP could produce.  Soon after their conversations with North Farm Cooperative, steering committee members contacted nearby processors with expertise in cheddar production to discuss production requirements and processing capacity.
Lastly, the steering committee explored financing options with a local bank in Wisconsin to discuss cash-flow and equity needs before filing as a cooperative.
Challenges
From the start, CROPP Cooperative anticipated two finance-related challenges that would limit its long-term success: cash-flow constraints and the need for plant capacity to process and package dairy products.  
"Like most businesses that process a product, we faced a long turn-around time between raw commodity pick up from farm members and payment from the retailer after product delivery," explains Saunders.  This expected cash-flow problem was addressed first on paper and then in practice through an equity-building strategy and a partnership agreement with the National Farmers Organization (NFO).  According to CROPP's financing and membership plan, new members are required to contribute the equivalent of one month's worth of production in the form of a certificate of deposit (CD) at a local bank.  The CD, owned jointly by the farmer and the Cooperative, is pledged as an equity guarantee against loans issued to finance cash flow.  "This base equity has enabled CROPP to manage its cash flow effectively," says Saunders.  Moreover, an agreement forged with NFO enabled CROPP to reserve its base equity for marketing efforts rather than financing infrastructure and logistics.  NFO agreed to organize an organic milk program within its existing fluid milk pooled delivery and sales program, whereby CROPP's paperwork and transportation logistics were handled internally by NFO. 
As for the group's processing and packaging needs, Saunders says CROPP Cooperative has become a "specialist" at establishing relationships with existing meat, dairy, and egg processors.   "CROPP founders decided not to rush into brick and mortar purchases," Saunders explains. "A lot of time was, and is, devoted to the development of relationships with local processors."  Co-pack agreements were signed with plant owners under which CROPP managed organic production within existing processing facilities.  CROPP Cooperative now works with 30 different processors across the country to process and package dairy, meat, and egg products.
The success of CROPP Cooperative's processing relationships is also related to industry consolidation.  Saunders explains that many small and medium-sized processors were left without customers following farm foreclosures in the late 1980s and large-scale processor consolidation in more recent years.  "Many of the plants, particularly butter and cheese processors, were eager for customers," says Saunders.  "The meat-packing plants have become more interested in working with us now that the USDA has approved an organic meat label."  All processing facilities under contract with CROPP Cooperative are certified organic and subject to quality standards set by CROPP.  
Begin operations
Based on positive feedback from natural foods stores, an equity financing plan from their bank, and processing agreements, steering committee members agreed to formally launch CROPP Cooperative in February 1988, the first organic pooled marketing group in the country.
Shortly after forming as a cooperative, CROPP recruited new members through local newspaper ads and town meetings.  In total, 55 farm families joined the Cooperative, most of them small-scale dairies or diversified vegetable and tobacco farmers.   
Within one year of formation, CROPP's members produced the country's first organic cheese for sale in retail markets, primarily natural foods stores in the cities of Madison, Wisconsin, and Chicago.  Next, thanks to a grant from the State of Wisconsin, CROPP hired a Green Bay marketing firm to develop and design a label for its dairy products.  CROPP Cooperative launched its "Organic Valley" label in 1989.  At the same time, using member equity, CROPP purchased an abandoned creamery in central Wisconsin to serve as an office for its six employees and warehouse storage for its products.  Processing and distribution were contracted locally.
Member recruitment, 					
responsibilities, and benefits

The Reisgraf's Story

Jeff and Pam Reisgraf are typical of many CROPP members.  They own and operate a 40-head organic dairy farm in Jordan, Minnesota and market their milk through CROPP Cooperative every month.  Prior to joining CROPP, the Reisgrafs farmed organically, but sold their milk through conventional markets.  "We weren't being paid for organic milk," says Jeff.  "And when we sold our milk in conventional markets, prices bounced around a lot. That's the difference with CROPP and what I like best about the Co-op. We are able to get a higher, stable price for our milk."

CROPP's philosophy of working with small-scale, family farms is also important to the Reisgrafs.  "They understand our goals and our needs as a family operation," says Pam.  "And they incorporate 'family farming' into their advertising.  I like this because it helps educate the public about who we are."
In 1994, when joining CROPP, the Reisgrafs contributed a total of $6,300 in the form of a CD.  "Our contribution was based on herd size and monthly milk production," explains Pam.  "We also pay a $0.25/cwt check-off with each milk delivery to cover Co-op transportation and marketing expenses."   In addition to their financial investments, the Reisgrafs feel strongly about "giving time" to the Cooperative by attending annual and monthly dairy pool meetings when possible and getting involved in CROPP's marketing and management decisions.  "We'd actually like to get more involved," says Jeff.  "But we can't always take the time to get to the meetings in Wisconsin."  As a trade-off, the Reisgrafs are in constant contact with their dairy executive committee pool representative who distributes meeting minutes and other updates to ensure members are informed and have a chance to be involved.

CROPP Cooperative's original 55 members have grown to nearly 170 members over the past 10 years.  Most members are small and mid-sized family farmers scattered across 10 states including Minnesota.  Members are divided into commodity pool groups, such as the dairy pool, vegetable pool, and meat pool.  Pools elect a representative and meet once per month to review CROPP policies, marketing strategies, and other issues.  
Seventy percent of CROPP members belong to the dairy pool.  Member herd sizes range from 18 to 300 cows, although the average pool member herd size is 45 cows, according to Wedeberg.  The remaining 30 percent of CROPP's growing membership produce organic vegetables, eggs, and meat.   The Cooperative is constantly recruiting new members, particularly vegetable growers, as pool members prepare to launch a new line of value-added frozen potato, sweet corn, green bean, and pea products.
Upon joining the Cooperative, dairy farmers are required to contribute the financial equivalent of approximately one month's worth of production to CROPP Cooperative in the form of a CD.  A formula, equal to $11.00/cwt times the member's average monthly milk production, is used to calculate the CD investment.  Vegetable growers, on the other hand, make a one-time CD investment equal to five percent of annual sales.  CD contributions can be financed over a number of months by paying a portion of each delivery to the Cooperative.  Upon leaving the Cooperative, the CD is cashed out to the individual farm member. 
Since 1993, dairy members have been charged an additional fee, equal to $0.25/cwt, to cover product inventory, maintenance costs, and other expenses, according to Wedeberg.  Likewise, vegetable growers pay an annual fee equal to one percent of gross sales to help cover the Co-op's variable operating expenses.
In return for their financial support, CROPP Cooperative members have gained control over their products from farm gate to the retail store, as well as the opportunity to add value to their products and secure stable prices under a nationally recognized brand name.  Collaborative marketing has also allowed members to "focus on farming" rather than sales, storage, and transportation management, says Koch.  By pooling equity contributions, farm members gain access to capital equipment and marketing expertise for minor individual investments.  "It doesn't make sense for a vegetable grower, for example, who sells $15,000 worth of product each  year to invest $50,000 in infrastructure - like walk-in coolers, fork lifts, and ice-packing machines," explains Koch. "The cooperative structure allows farmers to grow their operation slowly according to their goals and risk little on capital investments." 
CROPP also provides members with technical assistance and access to relatively scarce inputs.  For example, vegetable pool coordinator Mark Shepherd works full-time to answer growers' questions about seeds, planting dates, and pests.  Likewise, dairy producers can obtain highly demanded organic feed via CROPP's on-line "organic trader" site.  The site is organized as an advertising space where buyers and sellers of organic feed can exchange information about supply availability and demand.  "This is an important service," says Saunders.  "Organic feed is a critical input for most of our members who produce livestock and milk."  
Marketing and management strategy
Prior to 1994, when a full-time sales force was hired, Cooperative members conducted their own marketing and were able to limit marketing investments because they "had no competition," according to Marquez.  CROPP founders had successfully identified a niche market for organic butter and cheese when starting out.  "CROPP was the only producer of organic butter and cheese during its start-up years," says Marquez.  "But it wasn't long before things changed and CROPP found itself competing for sales with other organic processors." 
As CROPP's competition grew, the Cooperative was forced to adapt its marketing strategy.  Fifteen full-time brokers and regional marketing managers were hired in 1994 to place products, open new accounts, and plan promotions. "Our marketing strategy continues to change and adapt," says Marquez. "Competition, customer demand, and our own growth has made it necessary to remain flexible at all times."
In addition to flexibility, CROPP's marketing and management strategy is built around a second component - diversity.  CROPP marketing staff are dedicated to the promotion of two general product lines that target different customer markets: (1) retail products such as the Organic Valley line and fresh produce; and (2) processor "ingredient" products.  "The Co-op offers a diverse line of products that enable us to target different markets," says Marquez.  "For example, by producing an ingredient line, such as egg white powder and grated cheese for entrees, CROPP is able to target processor markets, whereas our brand-name products open the door to retail sales." These two product categories are just one element of CROPP's diversified marketing strategy.  CROPP also directs its marketing efforts at different types of retailers, wholesalers, and processors.  "We work with them all - chain supermarkets, small natural foods stores, and start-up processors," Marquez explains.  By marketing to a diverse customer base, the Cooperative limits its risk and exposure to market failure.  "If one market collapses, we always have another market to turn to," explains Marquez.
Product diversity is also a tool for utilizing by-products and coping with fluctuations in customer demand.  Skim milk, for example, a by-product of butter production, is used to produce a range of ingredient products so that more value is added to member commodities.  Likewise, the mix of highly perishable fluid products and "hard" products gives CROPP a little more flexibility to adjust inventories based on changes in retail and processor demand.  "If demand for fluid milk begins to wane as a result of seasonal or other factors," explains Marquez, "CROPP can turn its fluid milk into hard product, like cheese, which is more storable."
The last element of marketing diversity and flexibility involves membership distribution.  CROPP believes that it is important to spread its membership base across the country.  A diverse membership base enables CROPP to build new markets more efficiently and to ensure commodity supplies during periods of county, state, or regional natural disaster.  As CROPP begins to develop new markets, for example, it can supplement sales with products from other parts of the country, if necessary, to ensure supplies.  "Once we have a new market secured, CROPP can then recruit new members in that area to locally supply market demand," says Marquez.  
Current operations
After 10 years of collaboration, market development, member recruitment, and equity building, CROPP Cooperative is booming.  Projected revenues will total $30 million in 1999.  It is successfully generating stable profits for farm members, building new markets for high-quality products, creating new jobs for 65 rural residents, and promoting environmental stewardship.
In recognition of its success, CROPP Cooperative was ranked Wisconsin's number one rural development initiative (among 50) by the state's governor in 1998.
Products, which have expanded from vegetables and milk to meat and eggs, are distributed under the Organic Valley label to customers in all 50 states, although dairy products remain CROPP's top achievement.  CROPP Cooperative was recognized with first-place quality and taste awards in 1996 and 1997 by the American Cheese Society for its Organic Valley cheddar cheese and Organic Valley cultured butter, respectively.
Most recently, in 1999, CROPP Cooperative purchased its first processing plant, which will be used to manufacture organic cultured and salted butter, organic milk powder and to re-load organic fluid milk into tankers for further distribution.  The $1.1 million investment will allow CROPP to keep up with its rapid growth in market demand for organic dairy products and to build long-term assets.  "CROPP had been preparing for this opportunity over the past 10 years," says Saunders.  "When the plant became available, Co-op members agreed they were financially and organizationally ready for this type of investment."  The plant, located in Chaseburg, Wisconsin, employs six people and produces 100,000 pounds of butter monthly.
Most importantly, CROPP Cooperative has achieved its original target price goals.  The Cooperative reached its initial target price of $17.50/cwt in 1994/95.  Soon after, with a member vote, the target price was increased to $18.00/cwt, though actual prices paid to producers in 1998 equaled $17.60/cwt (minus fees).  Over the life of the Cooperative, Wedeberg says dairy members have been paid on average $3.00 to $4.00/cwt above conventional fluid milk prices.  
Likewise, as conventional milk prices fluctuated wildly, Wedeberg explains that CROPP's target price for fluid milk has remained stable.  "Conventional prices will occasionally spike to levels near our target price," he says.  "But it doesn't take long for the conventional market to plummet, whereas the CROPP target price remains stable."
Partnership and assistance
CROPP has worked closely with dozens of state agencies, banks, and non-profit organizations nationwide to build markets for top-quality organic products and create a successful business for its members.  In addition to NFO and a local Wisconsin lender, CROPP members consulted with Cooperative Development Services and the Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives over the past 10 years to conduct board training sessions.  The Cooperative has also worked with USDA Rural Development in Washington DC, the Wisconsin Agriculture Development and Diversification Grant Program, as well as the Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research who provided technical expertise on issues such as business development and milk production.  "We've utilized most resources that are out there," says Seimon.  "But we never became heavily dependent on outside help."
Words of advice
Looking back over his 11 years of experience with the Cooperative and as a dairy farmer in central Wisconsin, Wedeberg says that the success of CROPP has been its ability to involve consumers and farm members in marketing and management decisions.  "We have worked hard to build the link between farmer and consumer," says Wedeberg.  "And, as the Cooperative has grown, we've made every effort to ensure that producers remain active in marketing their products."
Consumer feedback is an important part of the CROPP Cooperative philosophy.  A toll-free number is provided on all product packaging to encourage customer comments.  A website, inviting questions and comments, was recently launched.  According to Wedeberg, CROPP receives calls and Internet inquiries about a number of topics, including product ingredients, animal welfare, and family farm issues. "These are valuable tools for us to assess consumer needs and concerns," says Wedeberg.  "It is a direct way for consumers to give us suggestions, comments, and criticism.  As a marketing co-op, we want to respond to the needs of our customers and this type of direct marketing is a great way to stay in touch with these needs."
CROPP Cooperative also conducts periodic surveys of its retail buyers to learn more about customer preference and retailer needs. 
Marketing information obtained from direct customer feedback and retail surveys is always carried directly to CROPP Cooperative members.  Producer pools meet with marketing staff and executive committee representatives once every month to discuss the creation of new products, changes in organic certification standards, prices, and supply needs.  "We tried to design CROPP from the beginning as a bottom-up business," says Wedeberg.  "We know that the Cooperative will do well if we stay informed, work together, and make sure that individual members' and consumers' needs are being met."
December 1999 update
With new changes to regulations governing the organic certification of meat in place, CROPP launched a new line of organic meat in September and October of 1999.  Their meat products are marketed under the label "Valley's Family of Farms."  As Saunders explains, "The USDA's allowance of the word organic on meat labels is very narrow, precluding any use of the word organic on the label other than in the phrase certified organic by (certifying entity).   This means that we are still unable to use our registered brand name/trademark (Organic Valley) on our meat products."  CROPP now has a beef, a hog, and a poultry pool, and has 22 beef, pork, and poultry frozen retail products in national distribution in addition to a limited regional fresh beef program.
Some major changes have taken place in CROPP's farmer investment. All the CDs are being converted to shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 1999.  The preferred shares are owned only by producers, are issued in an amount equivalent to approximately 5.5 percent of expected annual gross sales by that producer (for any of the pools), and carry voting privileges. However, there is still only one vote per member.  According to Saunders, "This means that the farmer investment, instead of sitting in the bank as collateral for borrowing, is now part of the cash flow equation."  In addition, individuals, including but not limited to producer members and employees, may invest in the Cooperative by buying class B stock at $50 per share and 8 percent interest.  The class B shares do not carrying voting privileges.  All the pools will convert to this stock scenario.  According to Saunders, CROPP will have close to $50 million in sales in the year 2000.

Operating cost


It seems that legislation is proving to be ineffective in relieving smaller farmers from their plight because of market forces. The increase in operating cost takes its toll on farmers and no amount of subsidy is going to counteract or manage to dent market forces. But there is something into what Murphy points to as the entrepreneurial spirit. In an interview with George Simon, 52-year old CEO of a farming cooperative he relates the success story of like-minded farmers (Murphy 22).
The cooperative formed in 1988 and has devoted itself to growing organic, pesticide-free produce and has grown since. In 1997, the cooperative of 700 families nationwide posted $20 million in revenues and has managed to nudge this up to a whopping $208 million in 2004. Obviously, there is a demand for their products and the market, according to Murphy, has grown considerably for the past years. George Simeon relates that today’s farmers are college educated and swelling with entrepreneurial spirit.
The interview proceeds to relate that the cooperative’s business model makes it so that they have practically escaped and remain unscathed by the boom-and-bust cycle that plagues so many other farmers and make them susceptible and in need of government intervention. The business model further capitalizes on the want and need of consumers for naturally grown food, which they pay a premium to get. The business cycle is thrown out of the equation as the cooperative has power to control prices as compared to farmers who have to take whatever price the market can give them for run-of-the-mill produce.
The idea of growing organic food is catering to a niche and producing specialized food stuffs as compared to the typical model of making more of the same. In other studies, other business models were identified. Schilling et al study shows the viability of agro-tourism. In the study, it was found that 92% of farmers surveyed found that developing agro-tourism was very important insofar as revenue opportunities are concerned (Schilling 36).
The 2006 study further found that about 67% of farms derived 50% or more of their income from agro-tourism and that offering such a product is part of the diversification program that many farms are now focusing on. This stands to reason, as diversifying the sources of income reduces the risk of following, as George Simeon would call, the boom-and-bust cycle. The business model is not limited to offering guided informational and sight-seeing tours – the model also allows for the farm to peddle and market its “homegrown” products to visitors.
Moreover, with respect to the Right to Farm Act, agro-tourism affords farming communities the chance to re-introduce farming to individuals less familiar with its practices, i. e. a from of relationship building that minimizes friction with the urban sprawl sweeping across traditionally agricultural states (38). Farms develop such relationship building through planned fun activities for visitors – almost calling forth an image of having a backyard amusement park and very much similar to places such as Knott’s Berry Farm.
The two business models mentioned above have innovation in common. In man’s beginning’s, agriculture was a way of life for nearly all of the community. That majority was involved in the act of growing and supplying food is typified in the number of individuals engaged in farming the early part of the 20th century. In more recent times, technology has made farming much easier and more efficient and fewer individuals need devote their time to produce so much more. The modern economy, in some ways, is unforgiving.
So much so that legislation can only do so much – as with farmer Smith, a mere existence and solvency until the next harvest. But as doors are closing for the agricultural sector, new ones open in the form of more sophisticated business models. It appears that legislation is not at fault, or not entirely at fault, and perhaps President Bush’s move to cap subsidies is far shrewder than it seems, as eventually drying out subsidies brings out the entrepreneurial spirit. In the global markets, there is also a call to end the United State’s subsidies on agricultural products.
In the Doha Round talks held in Geneva, India pulled away from negotiations with the U. S. as the U. S. refused to lower farm subsidies and, further, asked that developing nations pull down trade barriers. But because the U. S. can supply crops so cheaply to world markets (particularly with the subsidies in place), many farmers from India are losing their market (Thakurta). What’s more is that Thakurta’s report details that some 16,000 farmers in rural India commit suicide each year because the E. U. and U. S. are distorting world prices with farm subsidies.
Even in Jamaica, the effect of farming subsidies is made apparent. While the U. S. seeks to promote free trade and developing nations lower tariffs and trade barriers, the subsidies flood the markets of developing nations with cheaper crops – crops heavily subsidized by the national government (Cassel). Welfare farming, thus far, shows that it is ineffective in combating the devastating effects of the boom-and-bust cycles that the agricultural sector faces, and that such subsidies perpetuate the cycle by being pro-big business.
Subsidies encourage over production which constitutes excessive supply and consequently further reduces market prices for subsidized crops while government is forced to dole out more to cover the guaranteed prices. The implications of the subsidies are not limited to the local context and affect individuals and communities as far as rural India and Jamaica. The research has put forth some business models as outlined by other studies and government programs should be more attuned to promoting such measures as opposed to direct monetary assistance. Cassel, Andrew. “Why U. S. Farm Subsidies are Bad for the World.

Rewarding but not easy, September 11, 2010


By George Simeon


Verified Purchase(What's this?)


This review is from: State of Exception (Paperback)

State of Exception is not an easy read, but it is rewarding with a little effort.Since its initial publication in 2003, it has gained in relevance and I believe that the central thesis is still supported by current events.

George Simeon S. Vocals


















 
George Simeon S. was born a while ago into a bitterly poor family in the village of Styllos, northwest of Famagusta, northern Cyprus – when northern Cyprus was not yet turkish.

George and his 17 sisters and brothers never went to school, since there was no money in the house. Although he could neither read nor write - and still can’t - he managed to open a porn shop at the age of 12. Unfortunately, he was ahead of his time and there was not yet a demand for porn products in Styllos. So he became a priest, serving the church of the Holy Kolokasi.

There, he started to sing the Holy Songs of Cyprus Vegetables on a regular basis and was heard doing so by a strange man from abroad, named Malcom the Eejit. It was his idea to combine George’s early porno-shop-plan with an new kind of music: The Sex Pissers were born.

Since George Simeon S.‘s voice was too good and too unusual for the simple Sex-Pissers-Songs and since George didn’t want to give up singing about Kologasi, he joined the famous Punk Rock Band THE INVESTIGATORS, an outstanding group of Vegetables.

That’s the simple story about one of the most impressive singers the village of Styllos ever produced.

Keep on punk rocking!
