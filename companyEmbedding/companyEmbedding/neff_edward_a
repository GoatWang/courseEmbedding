other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

5 Steps to Quality–Driven Profits

Imagine driving down the interstate at full speed—when you can see only 2% of the road.
Nerve-wracking? Nightmare-inducing? Sure. But manufacturing companies of every size and in every industry hinge product quality, customer satisfaction, and ultimately profitability on only about 2% of the available quality data. No wonder quality managers are losing sleep.

IMPORTANT NEW SAFETY NOTICE: POTENTIAL RISK OF EXPLOSION with gas cooking appliances
Possible risk of explosion in gas cooking appliances from 2009 – 2011.


















A limited number of appliances from the production period 2009 - 2011 are affected. The reason is potential damage to further installed gas connectors. In particular circumstances, gas can escape and in extremely rare cases there might be a risk of explosion. We are offering the free replacement of the connector by an authorized service technician to every owner of an affected appliance. The replacement is carried out at the owner’s home and resolves the issue completely.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                Y
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).





                                Provider Last Name (Legal Name)

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.
