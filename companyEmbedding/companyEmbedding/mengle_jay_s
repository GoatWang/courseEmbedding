What Made This Man? Mengle

WHAT MADE THIS MAN? MENGELE

By Robert Jay Lifton
Robert Jay Lifton is Distinguished
Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the John Jay College of
Criminal Justice, City University of New York. This article is
adapted from a book on Nazi doctors scheduled for publication next
year by Basic Books.

HIS BONES DO NOT SATISFY. JOSEF
Mengele had come to symbolize the entire Nazi killing project. The
need was to capture him and put him on trial, hear his confession,
put him at our mercy. For many, that anticipated event took on the
significance of confronting the Holocaust and restoring a moral
universe. 
For Mengele has long been the focus
of what could be called a cult of demonic personality. He has been
seen as the embodiment of absolute evil, a doctor pledged to heal who
kills instead. But this demonization made him something of a deity, a
nonhuman or even superhuman force, and served as a barrier to any
explanation of his behavior. One reason Auschwitz survivors have
hungered for his capture and trial is to divest him of this status.
One of them, for instance, spoke to me of his yearning to see ''this
metamorphosis of turning him back into a person instead of God
Almighty.'' Mengele was a man, not a demon, and that is our problem.
Indeed, during recent weeks he had already begun to fall from grace
as a symbol of pure evil. The most notorious Nazi fugitive,
unsuccessfully pursued for decades, had suddenly appeared - as bones
in a Brazilian grave. The world watched in fascination as scientific
examination seemed to confirm that these were the right bones.

It was reported that Mengele had
lived out much of his last 25 years in lonely, despairing isolation,
that he had fallen in love with a housemaid. An exemplar of pure evil
is not supposed to experience loneliness or to care for another
person. 
What has been lost in the
preoccupation with the corpse has been the nature of the man: What
made Mengele Mengele? How can we explain his murderous behavior in
Auschwitz? Over the last eight years, while conducting research for a
book on Nazi doctors, I have sought answers to these questions. I
have conducted psychological interviews with 28 former Nazi doctors;
a number of Nazi lawyers, economists and other nonmedical
professionals, and also with more than 80 former Auschwitz inmates
who were engaged in medical work in the camp. The study has required
me to probe moral as well as psychological issues and to raise
questions about the nature of evil. 
Hannah Arendt gave currency to a
concept of the banality of evil in her portrayal of Adolf Eichmann as
a rather unremarkable bureaucrat who killed by meeting schedules and
quotas. She is surely correct in her claim that an ordinary person is
capable of extreme evil. But over the course of committing evil acts,
an ordinary person becomes something different. In a process I call
''doubling,'' a new self takes shape that adapts to the evil
environment, and the evil acts become part of that self. At this
point, the person and his behavior are anything but banal.

Mengele possessed unusually intense
destructive potential, but there were no apparent signs of aberrant
behavior prior to the Nazis and Auschwitz. Without Auschwitz, he
would probably have kept his destructive potential under control. As
a wise former inmate physician told me, ''In ordinary times, Mengele
could have been a slightly sadistic German professor.'' 
It was the coming together of the man
and the place, the ''fit'' between the two, that created the
Auschwitz Mengele. 
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE man who
arrived in Auschwitz in May 1943 is not especially remarkable. The
son of a well-to-do Bavarian industrialist, Mengele is remembered by
an acquaintance as a popular young man, an enthusiastic friend. He
was also intelligent, a serious student who showed ''a very distinct
ambitiousness.'' 
In 1931, at the age of 20, Mengele
joined a right-wing, nationalistic organization. He was an early Nazi
enthusiast, enlisting with the SA (the storm troopers) in 1933,
applying for party membership in 1937 and for SS membership the
following year. There are rumors that, while studying in Munich, he
met such high-ranking Nazis as Alfred Rosenberg, a leading ideologue,
and even Hitler himself. 
Mengele became a true ideologue: a
man who understood his life to be in the service of a larger vision.

According to an Auschwitz friend and
fellow-SS physician, Mengele espoused the visionary SS ideology that
the Nordic race was the only truly creative race, that it had been
weakened by Christian morality of Jewish origin, and that Germany
needed to revert to ancient German myths in creating an SS ''order''
to purify the Nordic race. According to his friend, Mengele was an
extreme anti-Semite, ''fully convinced that the annihilation of the
Jews is a provision for the recovery of the world and Germany.'' And
Mengele considered these views to be scientifically derived. (I have
preserved the anonymity of the people I interviewed. Those who are
identified had previously made themselves known in books or other
public documents.) Mengele's ideology considerably influenced his
intellectual choices. Matriculating not only at Munich but also at
Bonn, Vienna and Frankfurt, he came to concentrate on physical
anthropology and genetics, eventually working under Professor
Freiherr Otmar von Verschuer at the Institute of Hereditary Biology
and Racial Hygiene at Frankfurt. He earned a degree in anthropology
as well as medicine. 
Mengele produced three publications
before he came to Auschwitz. They dealt with physical characteristics
and abnormalities and, in each case, emphasized the role of heredity
-an emphasis in keeping with trends in German and international
scholarship at the time. Though jammed with charts, diagrams and
photographs that claim more than they prove, the papers are
relatively respectable scientific works of that era. But their
conclusions uniformly reflect Mengele's commitment to bringing
science into the service of the Nazi vision. 
Mengele seemed well on his way toward
an academic career. He had the strong backing of Verschuer who, in a
letter of recommendation, praised his reliability and his capacity
for clear verbal presentation of difficult intellectual problems.
Mengele's marriage to a professor's daughter was in keeping with his
academic aspirations. 
His military experience loomed large
in his idea of himself. In 1938-39, Mengele served six months with a
specially trained mountain light-infantry regiment, followed by a
year in the reserve medical corps. He spent three years with a Waffen
SS unit, mostly in the East, including action in Russia, where,
according to SS records, he was wounded and declared medically unfit
for combat. A commendation declared that he had ''acquitted himself
brilliantly in the face of the enemy,'' and he received five
decorations, including the Iron Cross First Class and Second Class.

Mengele, his friend said, was the
only doctor in Auschwitz who possessed that array of medals, and he
was enormously proud of them; he frequently referred to his combat
experience to bolster his arguments on a variety of matters.
According to his friend, Mengele arrived at the camp with a special
aura because he was coming more or less directly from the front.

His friend suggests something else
special about Mengele: He had asked to be sent to the Auschwitz death
camp because of the opportunities it could provide for his research.
He continued to have the support and collaboration of his teacher,
Verschuer, who convinced the German Research Society to provide
financial support for Mengele's work. 
AUSCHWITZ WAS BOTH AN ANNIHILA-tion
camp and a work camp for German industry. Like other SS doctors
there, Mengele had the task of ''selecting'' prisoners for the gas
chamber - the vast majority - and for the slave labor force. SS
doctors also controlled and supervised the inmate doctors who alone
did whatever actual medical treatment was done. Mengele was the chief
doctor of Birkenau, an Auschwitz subcamp, but seemed to many inmates
to have authority beyond his position. Dr. Olga Lengyel, an inmate
doctor, described Mengele as ''far and away the chief provider for
the gas chamber and the crematory ovens.'' Another inmate doctor
spoke of Mengele's role as ''very important, more than that of the
others.'' 
One reason he appeared to be
especially important was that he was extraordinarily energetic. While
many SS doctors did no more than what was required of them, Mengele
was always on the move, busy with his work, initiating new projects.
More than any other SS doctor, he seemed to find his calling in
Auschwitz. 
Many inmates thought that Mengele
alone conducted the large ''selections.'' When they arrived at
Auschwitz, packed by the hundreds into freight and cattle cars, they
were unloaded and herded down a ramp. The Nazi doctors were assigned,
on a rotating basis, to stand on the ramp and select those prisoners
who would live, as workers at the camp, and those who would be
killed. 
The evidence is that Mengele took his
turn at the ramp, like everyone else, but he also appeared there
frequently to make sure that any twins in a ''transport,'' as the
trains were called, would be collected and saved for his research.
But the prisoners saw it differently. At a trial of former Auschwitz
personnel, in Frankfurt in 1964, an inmate who had been assigned to
unload the transports recalled only the name of Mengele. When the
judge commented, ''Mengele cannot have been there all the time,'' the
witness answered: ''In my opinion, always. Night and day.'' Mengele
brought such flamboyance and posturing to the selections task that it
was his image inmates remembered. 
He was an elegant figure on the ramp
- handsome, well-groomed, extremely upright in posture. Prisoners
sometimes described him as ''very Aryan looking'' or ''tall and
blond,'' when he was actually of medium height, with dark hair and a
dark complexion. Inmates said Mengele ''conveyed the impression of a
gentle and cultured man'' and spoke of the ''cheerful expression on
his face . . . almost like he had fun . . . he was very playful.''

There was an easy rhythm in his
approach to selections. He walked back and forth, an inmate recalled,
''a nice-looking man'' with a riding crop in his hand who ''looked at
the bodies and the faces just a couple of seconds'' and said, ''Links
[left], Rechts [right], Links, Rechts...Links,
Rechts...Links, Rechts.'' 
Prisoners were struck by the stark
contrast between his calm, playful manner and the horror of what he
was doing. Occasionally, though, his detachment could give way to
outbreaks of rage and violence, especially when he encountered
resistance to his sense of ''the rules.'' In one instance, a mother
refused to be separated from her teen-age daughter and scratched the
face of the SS trooper who tried to enforce Mengele's decision.
Mengele drew his gun and shot both the woman and her child. Still
raging, he ordered that all the people from that transport whom he
had previously selected as workers be sent to the gas chamber.

In the hospital blocks where medical
treatment was given to prisoners in order to maintain the workforce,
there was another kind of ''selection'' process. Nazi doctors would
weed out for the gas chamber the weakest patients, those thought
unlikely to recover in two or three weeks. Mengele, Dr. Lengyel
recalled, ''could show up suddenly at any hour, day or night. . . .
when we least expected him.'' The prisoners would ''march before him
with their arms in the air while he continued to whistle his Wagner -
or it might be Verdi or Johann Strauss.'' THOUGH USUALLY COOL IN HIS
CONDUCT OF SELEC-tions, Mengele was passionate in pursuing his
''scientific research.'' His main interest was the study of twins,
but he carried out a variety of projects with different groups of
human subjects. He collected and studied dwarfs in an effort to
determine the genetic reasons for their condition. 
He investigated a gangrenous
condition of the face and mouth called noma. 
Though ordinarily a rare condition,
it was common among gypsy inmates of Auschwitz. It was known to be
caused by the kind of debilitation that inmates were subject to, but
Mengele focused on what he deemed to be genetic and racial factors.

He sought out inmates with a
condition known as heterochromia of the iris - in which the two eyes
are of different colors -and, after their death, sent their eyes to
his old professor, Verschuer, at the Berlin-Dahlem Institute of
Racial Biology. With some of these inmates, Mengele took the bizarre
step of attempting to change eye color in an Aryan direction by
injecting methylene blue into the brown eyes of blond inmate
children. 
But the research that most occupied
Mengele, to which he devoted the greatest time and energy, was his
study of twins. In fact, he probably came to Auschwitz for that
specific purpose - as a continuation of work he had done under
Verschuer at the University of Frankfurt a few years earlier.

As early as 1935, Verschuer had
written of the absolute necessity of research on twins to achieve
''complete and reliable determination of what is hereditary in man.''

Because identical twins (derived from
the same ovum) possess the same genetic constitution, they have
traditionally been used in research on hereditary influences. Their
shared physical and sometimes psychological characteristics, normal
and abnormal, can be assumed to be genetically determined. Such
characteristics can be assumed to be genetically determined in other
people as well. 
Mengele recognized that Auschwitz
would permit him to pursue his mentor's dream. From the hundreds of
thousands of prisoners, he could collect twins in quantities never
before available to a scientist. What is more, he could exercise
total control over them. 
He could compare measurements and
bodily features. He could try medications meant to prevent, treat or
induce a particular illness on an individual twin, or both of a pair
of twins. He could then make comparisons of various kinds, in which
he sought to demonstrate the importance of heredity rather than
environment. He had no need or inclination to concern himself with
ethical considerations, sharing as he did the general SS doctor's
view that one was doing no harm since Auschwitz inmates, especially
Jews, were in any case doomed. 
Mengele had a fanatic's commitment to
twin research. A number of survivors reported seeing him on the
transport ramp, shouting ''Zwillinge heraus! [Twins out!],''
''Zwillinge heraustreten! [Twins step forward!].'' An inmate
anthropolo-gist whom Mengele had eagerly recruited to assist him
described the arrival of a group of Hungarian Jews ''like a river . .
. women, men, women with children, and suddenly I saw Mengele going
quickly...the same speed [as] the crowd [crying out]
only 'Zwillinge heraus!' . . . with such a face that I would think
he's mad.'' 
Mengele had the same frenzied
attitude in carrying out his research. To inmates, he seemed to have
an inner compulsion to get a great deal accomplished quickly in a
personal race against time. He undoubtedly came to recognize
increasingly that the days of the Auschwitz research bonanza were
numbered. 
MAINLY TO PURSUE HIS studies of
twins, Mengele set up an Auschwitz caricature of an academic research
institute. Inmate doctors, mostly Jewish, with specialized training
in various laboratory and clinical areas, were called upon to
contribute to his work by diagnosing, sometimes treating, X-raying
and performing post-mortem examinations of his research subjects. For
his pathologist, Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, he provided a special dissection
room complete with porcelain sinks and a dissecting table of polished
marble. The overall arrangement, as Dr. Nyiszli later wrote, was
''the exact replica of any large city's institute of pathology.'' In
addition to the area used by SS physicians, Mengele had three offices
of his own, mainly for work with twins. 
The precise number of twins Mengele
studied is not known, but during the spring and summer of 1944, the
time of the influx and mass murder of enormous numbers of Hungarian
Jews, he accumulated what inmates of the men's and women's camps
estimated to be a total of 175 sets of twins; it was an
extraordinarily large number to have available simultaneously in a
single place. Most were children, but the twins ranged up to the age
of 70. The relative number of identical twins, as opposed to
nonidentical twins, is also uncertain. (Nonidentical twins come from
different ova and are genetically similar only to the extent of
ordinary siblings.) Mengele's capacity or inclination to maintain, in
his work, the crucial distinction between these two kinds of twins is
unclear. Since it is known that a few ordinary siblings masqueraded
as twins, upon discovering the advantages of doing so, there is
reason to doubt the reliability of Mengele's research. 
Being a twin gave one a much better
chance to survive. That was especially true for children, who were
otherwise routinely selected for the gas chamber on arrival.

Twins had unique status. They felt
themselves, as one put it, ''completely elevated, segregated from the
hurly-burly of the camp.'' They lived in special blocks, usually
within medical units. They were frequently permitted to keep their
own clothing. Their heads were not shaved. Their diet was rich by
Auschwitz standards, often including white bread and milk. They were
never beaten, as one surviving twin explained - even if they were
caught in such a normally ''ultimate sin'' as stealing food - because
the word was out ''not to ruin us physically.'' 
Mothers of young female twins were
sometimes allowed to stay with their children, though usually only
temporarily, in order to help the twins remain in good physical and
mental condition - and on occasion to contribute to information about
heredity and family history. We may say that the lives of twins had
unique existential value in Auschwitz. 
Mengele's research method, according
to the inmate anthropologist, was standard for the time - and much
the same as that used by her own well-regarded professor at the
Polish university where she had obtained her advanced degree. That
professor, she said, stressed ''the biological foundation of
[the] social environment'' and the delineation of ''racial
types.'' Mengele's approach was different only in being ''terribly
detailed.'' 
Measurements were taken of the twins'
skulls and bodies and various characteristics of the nose, lips,
ears, hair and eyes. The inmate anthropologist used quality Swiss
instruments and wore a white coat ''like a physician.'' 
Identical twins, Mengele's most
treasured research objects, were often examined together. As one of
them described: ''It was like a laboratory. . . . There isn't a piece
of body that wasn't measured and compared. . . . We were always
sitting together - always nude. . . . We would sit for hours
together.'' 
When Mengele himself performed the
examination, they said, he was very proper and methodical: ''He
concentrated on one part of the body at one time...like [one
day] he measured our eyes for about two hours.'' They spoke of
being examined as frequently as twice a week for a period of five
months in late 1944, and also remembered vividly a special visit to
the Auschwitz main camp for photographs. 
There were less benign research
programs on twins. One twin survivor, for example, told how he and
his 12-year-old twin sister would be examined and subjected to such
procedures as the injection of material into their spines or the
clamping of some part of the body ''to see how long you could stand
the pressure.'' 
The twin survivor also spoke of
Mengele's supervising ''a lot of research with chemicals'' and of how
Mengele's assistants ''might stick a needle in various places from
behind,'' including the performing of spinal taps. These procedures,
when done on young children, resulted sometimes in loss of
consciousness, deafness and - among the smaller children - death.

The final step in Mengele's research
on a number of the twins was dissection. Auschwitz enabled him not
only to observe and measure twins to compare them in life, but to
arrange for them to die together. He could thereby obtain comparisons
of healthy or diseased organs to show the effects of heredity.

Sometimes Mengele himself presided
over the murder of his twins. A deposition given by Dr. Nyiszli in
1945 described one such event: ''In the work room next to the
dissecting room, 14 gypsy twins were waiting . . . and crying
bitterly. Dr. Mengele didn't say a single word to us, and prepared a
10 cc. and 5 cc. syringe. From a box he took evipan, and from another
box he took chloroform, which was in 20 cubic-centimeter glass
containers, and put these on the operating table. After that, the
first twin was brought in . . . a 14-year-old girl. Dr. Mengele
ordered me to undress the girl and put her on the dissecting table.
Then he injected the evipan into her right arm intravenously. After
the child had fallen asleep, he felt for the left ventricle of the
heart and injected 10 cc. of chloroform. After one little twitch the
child was dead, whereupon Dr. Mengele had it taken into the corpse
chamber. In this manner, all 14 twins were killed during the night.''

Mengele could be totally arbitrary in
his killings. An inmate radiologist told of a pair of gypsy twins,
''two splendid boys of 7 or 8, whom we were studying from all aspects
- from the 16 or 18 different specialties we represented.'' The boys
both had symptoms in their joints that, according to a belief at that
time, could be linked to tuberculosis. Mengele was convinced that the
boys were tubercular, but the various inmate doctors, including the
radiologist, found no trace of that disease. 
Mengele was outraged, and he left the
room, ordering the radiologist to remain. When he returned about an
hour later, Mengele said calmly: ''You are right. There was
nothing.'' After some silence, Mengele added, ''Yes, I dissected
them.'' Later, the radiologist said, he heard from Dr. Nyiszli that
Mengele had shot the two boys in the neck and that ''while they were
still warm, began to examine them: lungs first, than each organ.''

The two boys, the radiologist added,
had been favorites with all the doctors - including Mengele. They had
been treated very well, he added, ''spoiled in all respects . . .
these two especially . . . they fascinated him considerably.'' But
their post-mortem study had still greater fascination for him.

Mengele's fanatically brutal approach
to his research can be understood mainly in terms of his combination
of ideological zealotry and scientific ambition. Verschuer, his
mentor, was taking science in a Nazi direction when he declared that
research with twins would demonstrate ''the extent of the damage
caused by adverse hereditary influences'' as well as ''relations
between disease, racial types, and miscegenation.'' In Auschwitz,
Mengele saw an opportunity to deepen and extend the Nazi racial
vision by means of systematic research ''evidence.'' 
He was also intent upon gaining
personal recognition as a scientist. Indeed, his Auschwitz friend
told me that Mengele planned to use his research with twins as the
basis for his Habilitation, the presentation necessary for a formal
university appointment. Mengele's ideological worship, then, included
the worship of Nazified ''science,'' and from that stand-point he
told his friend that ''it would be a sin, a crime . . . and
irresponsible not to utilize the possibilities that Auschwitz had for
twin research,'' and that ''there would never be another chance like
it.'' 
Mengele saw himself as a biological
revolutionary, part of a vanguard devoted to the bold scientific task
of remaking his people and ultimately the people of the world. The
German race would have to be cured and its genes improved. Many
believed, as one inmate doctor said, that Mengele wanted to make use
of his research on twins ''to find the cause of multiple
pregnancies'' in order to increase such events among Aryan women. In
any case, he did wish to apply his results toward German-centered
racial goals. 
Mengele's friend revealed something
of this motivation when he told me that Mengele saw his work as
having bearing on selecting national leaders ''not on a political
basis but on a biological basis.'' He might well have been unclear
himself about his exact motivations, but we have reason to see in
them a combination of distorted scientific claims and related
ideological fantasies. 
M ENGELE'S TREAT-ment of twins
provides important additional clues to his psychology. There we see
displayed the full range of his adaptation to the Auschwitz
environment. Survivors repeatedly commented on his confusing duality
of affection and violence, an extreme manifestation of the process I
call ''doubling.'' 
The twins lived in an atmosphere that
combined sanctuary with terror. As one recalled, they never forgot
they were in Auschwitz where, starting in the summer of 1944, they
could clearly see ''flames really coming up every day, every night''
from the open pits in which bodies were burned, and they could ''hear
every evening a cacophony of screams'' and breathe in ''the
unbearable smell.'' 
Yet most of the twins were safe,
under the protection of Mengele, and much of the time he treated them
lovingly. According to an inmate doctor, Mengele in his contacts with
the children was ''as gentle as a father,'' talking to them and
patting them on the head ''in a loving way.'' He could be playful,
jumping about to please them. The twin children frequently called him
''Uncle Pepi.'' Sometimes, though, as the inmate doctor reported,
Mengele would bring some gypsy twins sweets and invite them for a
ride in his car, which turned out to be ''a little drive with Uncle
Pepi, to the gas chamber.'' 
For many of the twins, the strength
of their warm feelings toward Mengele was such that they found it
impossible in later years to believe the evil things they heard about
him. ''For us,'' one said, he was ''like a papa, like a mama.''

One inmate doctor, in his own
excruciating struggles to come to terms with Mengele, thought of him
as ''the double man'' who had ''all the human feelings, pity and so
on,'' but also had in his psyche an ''impenetrable, indestructible
cell, which is obedience to the received order.'' 
He was describing Mengele's Auschwitz
self, the new self that can take shape in virtually anyone in
adapting to an extreme environment. With the Auschwitz self,
Mengele's potential for evil became actual, even as he maintained
elements of his prior self that included affection toward children.
In this process, each part-self behaved as a functioning whole: the
Auschwitz self enabling him to function in that murderous environment
and to exploit its human resources with considerable efficiency; the
prior self enabling him to maintain a sense of decency. His powerful
commitment to Nazi ideology served as a bridge, a necessary
connection between the two. 
Mengele's Auschwitz behavior reflects
important pre-existing psychological tendencies that contributed
greatly to that doubling process. His inclinations toward omnipotence
and total control over others could be given extreme expression in
Auschwitz. 
The man and the place were
dramatically summed up by a survivor who did art work for him and
spoke of herself as Mengele's ''pet,'' someone who was pleasant to
have around. The death camp, she said, was like a city dog pound,
with Mengele as the inspector checking up on the keepers -the inmate
doctors - and on the dogs - the inmates. 
The inspector, she recalled, would
often admonish the keepers to ''wash up the excrement'' in the pound,
''to keep it clean, to keep the dogs healthy.'' Then he would examine
''these chambers where they are killed'' and he would inquire about
the dog population: ''How many are you? Well, it's too crowded - you
better put in two more [gas chambers] today.'' 
This image, with its blending of
omnipotence and sadism, was relevant to much of Mengele's
relationship to twins. ''It was an axiom,'' one of them told me,
''that Mengele is God. He used to come always with an entourage,
very-well decked out, very elegant. He always carried around him an
aura of some terrifying threat, which is, I suspect, unexplainable to
normal human beings who didn't see this.'' It was ''literally
impossible,'' the survivor said, ''to transmit the edge of this
terror.'' 
Only in Auschwitz could Mengele
assume that aura and become what the inmate artist described as ''a
very charismatic man'' with ''star quality.'' But when she added,
''Marilyn Monroe flashed through my mind,'' she was perhaps
suggesting the strong element of mannered self-display, what is
loosely called ''narcissism'' - and perhaps a certain amount of
kitsch and absurdity -contained in Mengele's assumption of
omnipotence. 
Another prior trait, Mengele's
schizoid tendencies, were reflected in survivors' accounts of his
''dead eyes'' - eyes that showed no emotion, that avoided looking
into the eyes of others. The inmate artist described him as so
distant from others that ''he seemed to be from a different planet.''
That kind of schizoid person, however friendly or affectionate at
times, remains fundamentally removed from others, with inner
divisions that can contribute to the doubling process. 
Mengele's exaggerated immaculateness
was consistent with such tendencies toward withdrawal. He was ''very
sensitive about bad smells,'' an inmate doctor reported, so that
before he arrived, ''the doors and windows had to be opened.'' He was
''Clean, clean, clean!'' one survivor said. This passion for
cleanliness actually became part of Mengele's selection esthetic. He
often sent prisoners with skin blemishes - even those with small
abscesses or old appendectomy scars - to the gas chamber. 
All people are capable of psychic
numbing, a diminished tendency or inclination to feel. But Mengele's
version of the Auschwitz self - his ease in harming and killing -
carried psychic numbing to a remarkable extreme. ''The main thing
about him,'' an observant inmate-doctor stated, ''was that he totally
lacked feeling.'' He was enabled to feel nothing in killing a young
twin, even one he had been fond of, to make a medical point.

Mengele's sadism was of a piece with
these other traits. The pleasure he could take in causing pain was an
aspect of his omnipotence, a means of maintaining his schizoid
withdrawal and his renunciation of anything in the realm of
fellow-feeling toward his victims. That kind of sadism was manifest
in his smiling enthusiasm at selections. It was present in his remark
to a Jewish woman doctor who was pleading vainly for the life of her
father: ''Your father is 70 years old. Don't you think he has lived
long enough?'' And survivors tell of Mengele's proclaiming on Tisha
B'Av, the commemoration of the destruction of the first and second
temples, ''We will have a concert.'' There was a concert, then a
roll-call, then an enormous selection for the gas chamber.

I N HIS PLAY ''THE DEPUTY,'' Rolf
Hochhuth creates a fiendish Nazi character known only as ''the
Doctor,'' modeled after Mengele, who is described as hav-ing ''the
stature of Absolute Evil,'' as ''only playing the part of a human
being.'' 
Some inmate-doctors also viewed
Mengele as a demon and wished to divest him of his professional
status. One described him as ''a monster, period,'' and another as
''no more doctor than anything else.'' 
But being a doctor was part of
Mengele's demonology: he took on the dark side of the omnipotent
Svengali-like physician-shaman. 
The myth of Mengele's demonic stature
was given added support by the often misleading rumors about his life
after Auschwitz. He was said to be living in comfort in South
America, advising dictators such as Gen. Alfredo Stroessner of
Paraguay on how to annihilate the Indian population, growing wealthy
in an extensive drug trade run by former Nazis. Nobody could touch
Mengele. We have seen that his death has partly dispelled this
demonology. His continuing ''metamorphosis'' into an ordinary mortal
can be enhanced by probing his motivations and behavior. 
The psychological traits Mengele
brought to Auschwitz exist in many of us, but in him they took
exaggerated form. His impulse toward omnipotence and total control of
the world around him were means of fending off anxiety and doubt,
fears of falling apart - ultimately, fear of death. That fear also
activated his sadism and extreme psychic numbing. He could quiet his
fears of death in that death-dominated environment by performing the
ultimate act of power over another person: murder. 
Yet, as far as we know, he had
neither killed nor maimed prior to Auschwitz, and had in fact
functioned in a more or less integrated way. 
The perfect match between Menegele
and Auschwitz changed all that. Through doubling, he could call forth
his evil potential. That evil, generally speaking, is neither
inherent in any self nor foreign to it. Under certain kinds of
psychological and moral conditions it can emerge. Crucial to that
emergence is an ideology or world view, a theory or vision that
justifies or demands evil actions. 
Viewed in this light, Josef Mengele
emerges as he really was: a visionary ideologue, an efficiently
murderous functionary, a diligent careerist - and disturbingly human.
