This Brand Could Be Your Life: David Shapiro’s “Supremacist” | The New YorkerShopSign in|Link your subscriptionCulture DeskThis Brand Could Be Your Life: David Shapiro’s “Supremacist”By Maria BustillosJune 28, 2016David Shapiro’s “Supremacist,” a new novel about a New Yorker obsessed with the cult clothing brand Supreme, offers a fresh, strangely affecting critique of American consumerism.PHOTOGRAPH BY PATTI MCCONVILLE / ALAMYThe consumerist path of least resistance in America takes you to Amazon for books, Uber for transportation, Starbucks for coffee, and Pandora for songs. Facebook’s “Trending” list shows you the news, while Yelp ratings lead you to a nearby burger. The illusion of choice amid such plenty is easy to sustain, but it’s largely false; you’re being herded by algorithms from purchase to purchase. Here are the places you can spend money, the things you can wear: the shops contain certain things that change according to a set schedule. Your purchase goes in a bag with a logo printed on it. The logo says something about what’s in the bag, and something about where you shop—maybe even something about who you are.James Jebbia founded Supreme, a cult clothing retailer, in New York, in 1994. He is a former associate of the streetwear pioneer Shawn Stussy, whose work from the eighties onward embodied a Zeitgeist originating in the surf culture of Southern California. You could describe it as unfussy but mindful of beauty and quality; athletic without being jockish; fun-loving, cheeky, male-focussed. Through its connection to Hawaii, California skate/surf culture has long-standing ties to Japan, and it also has strong bonds with punk and Oi! culture, with street art and tagging, and with weed culture. Stussy’s genius was in synthesizing these elements into a fashion identity and brand that found admirers far from Malibu and San Onofre.Supreme, the most prominent of Stussy’s heirs, added a New York veneer of heightened exclusivity and sophistication to that legacy; it’s equal parts retail, art project, and hangout. The company announced its multifarious intentions right up front, with a red-and-white logo directly referring to the textual art of Barbara Kruger—an association the artist found reason to scorn, in 2013, when the logo was the occasion of a trademark dispute between Supreme and a rival clothing brand. But even that disconnect, in a way, somewhat embodied the sense of impudence that keeps kids lining up to buy the brand.Supreme’s stuff is just a little expensive for what it is; T-shirts are priced at around thirty dollars, for example. But the goods are well made and the prices essentially fair, with clever designs expressing the brand’s signature breezy male athleticism, semi-rebellious attitude, and sense of fun. Kate Moss, Joe Louis, Black Sabbath, Charles Bronson, and Betty Boop have all made an appearance on Supreme merchandise. There are hoodies, sneakers, and off-the-wall branded goods, from pocketknives to fire extinguishers. Many of the designs are produced in partnership with a wide range of well-known artists, from H. R. Giger to Rammellzee to John Baldessari to Comme des Garçons. Each product is offered in a very limited run, creating a lively and lucrative secondary market, as David Shapiro reported for The New Yorker, in 2013. Twenty-odd years in, the brand is still expanding, with its tenth shop, in Paris, having opened a few weeks ago.Into this context comes “Supremacist,” a new novel by Shapiro, who is now working as a corporate lawyer specializing in private-equity transactions; he spoke to me by phone on a Sunday afternoon, when I found him lawyerishly playing mini-golf “with a little putting green that I keep in my office.” (Shapiro is also the author of the popular, now-defunct Pitchfork Reviews Reviews blog and the novel “You’re Not Much Use to Anyone.”) The plot of “Supremacist,” such as it is, tells of a mildly unhinged New Yorker named David who is obsessed with the Supreme brand, and who persuades his rich, footloose friend Camilla to join him on a horrifically intoxicated pilgrimage to every Supreme shop in the world: in Los Angeles; London; Japan, where they make four stops; and back home in New York.David is a social train wreck, getting drunk, taking too many drugs, falling asleep in the street, making blunderingly sexist comments, and swiping the snack of the passenger napping beside him on an airplane. In this way, David the narrator, who is at some uncertain remove from David the author, is a familiar American male character whose candor renders him appealing despite his unpleasantness, as we find in Bukowski, Miller, Mailer, Updike, Wallace, Heller, Franzen, and so on. The author (whose real surname is not Shapiro) really went on the trip described in the book, and really is a diehard Supreme fan. When I asked him what he had hoped to achieve with “Supremacist,” he replied that the trip had itself been the goal. “I paid my way by writing this book, and that’s what I wanted to do.”The story amounts to a weirdly affecting critique of consumerism, half homage to Supreme and half culture-jamming. “Frankly, I find the brand to be like a brilliant art project, and also I find, obviously, some self-loathing in loving it so much,” Shapiro said. “I don’t know. There is some dissonance, obviously.” His feelings about the novel are similarly complicated: “I want to divorce myself from it because it’s so ugly, and depressing, but at the same time realizing that almost everything I say is exactly what would be expected for the narrator to say. I mean, I made this thing, and it’s so ugly, and I don’t want it to be anything like me, but it is who I am, to a great extent.”Why would you feel that your book is ugly, when you’re so patently disgusted with the narrator’s materialist obsessions? I asked. The criticism presumably comes from somewhere else entirely, from a better place; you’re saying that this is gross, it shouldn’t be like this, it should be different—we don’t like being enslaved to things we can buy. “Yeah yeah, the character in the book is like, it is absurd to think that you could buy something and wear it, and it be a declaration of something intrinsic to you. It’s absurd!” Shapiro said. But later he described to me the dual nature of this character’s longing for an unattainable coolness, finding that ridiculous, impossible, but still hoping it’s not. “Supreme is the coolest thing, in a way, to the narrator—you know, and to me—and he goes on the trip in the hopes of absorbing it, through, like, osmosis,” he said. “Like sitting there long enough and just popping out, one day, a cool guy. Not only a cool guy, but like . . . well adjusted, and, you know? All the things that the brand promises.”Surely all clothing is aspirational to some extent. What you wear, how you speak, how you cut your hair, how you educate yourself all create a personality, a way of being in the world that you yourself can stand. All this is silly and artificial, but also not—it’s also serious, and has a meaning. There’s who you are, and how you express your life, just by living, and then there’s the manufactured sort of carapace that you’re making deliberately, to show to other people, to signal to them various things.I tell Shapiro about the arguments I’ve had with my elderly mom on this score, like when she expresses disapproval of a waitress’s tattoos, and I tell her, Look, this is not for you; just like when you used to complain about whatever glam-rock garbagio I was sporting in the seventies (and yes, that is how long we have been arguing). Not for you! You are not the audience for these tattoos, for those long-ago-torn fishnets. Why do you think this lady would be trying to wear something that you would like? You have nothing to offer this person. You don’t have anything she wants! She is communicating to someone else. So part of it’s real, then; when some teen-ager buys the Supreme skateboard deck, or the shirt, what’s really going on is that he’s showing all his friends, I’m this kind of person.In the novel, David and Camilla visit a skater bar in Japan, where a boy with a beautiful voice is singing karaoke “to a schmaltzy ballad.” The kids in the bar call him an otaku. A cool Japanese boy fools around with his iPhone when conversation lags. The low-affect approach is a bit Knausgaardian, put across in the simplest of declarative sentences. But then, in a throwaway line, David shows them his “Fuck Bush” tattoo. (“I’ll never forgive him.”) It's difficult to describe without spoiling the effect, but this is just one among many jarring little touches that re-situate the narrator’s consumerism, and “First World problems” generally, in a wider world—a world that is in trouble—one in which so much about an iPhone is exploitative and bad, and maybe even flying to Japan is, in a sense, ridiculous, excessive, a wasteful notion, let alone flying there to visit four roughly identical shops.But the point is not belabored; the next few moments find David painfully embarrassed of his Supreme flower pants. (“They were meant to demonstrate confidence in my masculinity, but suddenly, it seemed like I was just a guy wearing very effeminate pants.”) These absurdities are layered up, money spent, drinks catalogued. Anxieties and misunderstandings multiply. And yet tiny bits of beauty are wandering in all the time, despite everything. There are “ghost sculptures” hanging from the ceiling in the Supreme store in Nagoya. David touches all the clothes, “especially the fireman’s coat and the Love Supreme tee”; he rhapsodizes about “the material, the heavy cotton.”Just as Supreme makes a work of modern art from a joke about retail culture and commerce—a joke about itself—so does “Supremacist” echo that joke. Shapiro’s novel is a mise en abyme, an ultra joke about being someone who travels to Fukuoka, where he can’t resist buying a Supreme Hardcore Hammer; that is, a hammerhead mounted on an axe handle. (“I was only a man.”)Shapiro’s vision of materialist America is brutally honest, complex, and self-contradictory. He takes back the knife of consumerism and makes of it something wild and strange, imperfect, terrible, disturbing, unpredictable, mutable, at once lovely and unbearable. That’s why “Supremacist” is a far more nuanced and more effective response to materialism than any soup-can painting could ever be. It breaks all the ordinary frameworks of oppositional cultural criticism; now inside it all, now outside, loving and hating all that we are. It isn’t sly, like the Pepsi “Choice of a New Generation” ads so masterfully skewered by David Foster Wallace, or reactionary or appropriationist, as Thomas Frank describes consumer culture in “The Conquest of Cool.” It’s a sharp, candid portrait of the artist as a young man in twenty-first-century New York, and of the sick but also magical world in which he lives.Awaiting the book’s publication, on July 5th, Shapiro is pretty worried that James Jebbia and co. will not like his work. “You know, their philosophy in general is, like, move along, nothing to see here, just some stuff on a T-shirt, if you like it you can buy it, that’s it,” he said. “I just feel like they might regard it as like an invasion in some way.” But Supreme’s management is aware of the book, Shapiro told me. “I have e-mailed with the founder. . . . I told him, like, the broad contours of the book, and he e-mailed me back about something unrelated, and made no mention.”Most Popular1.Ryan LizzaAnthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve BannonBy Ryan Lizza2.Daily CommentWhy Anthony Scaramucci’s Attack on Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon MattersBy David Remnick3.Daily CommentDonald Trump’s State of Mind, and OursBy Evan Osnos4.Daily CommentJohn McCain’s Health-Care Vote Was an Act of DefianceBy Mark Singer5.Satire from The Borowitz ReportCruz: “The Dream of Keeping Poor People from Seeing a Doctor Must Never Die”By Andy Borowitzour thirty most popularRecommended StoriesCulture DeskFlipping SupremeBy David ShapiroNov. 05, 2013Cultural CommentIt’s Raining MenswearTaking stock of the Internet-centric movement that has, for the past decade, more or less covertly reshaped the way men dress.By Joshua RothmanNov. 12, 2015Page-TurnerJonathan Franzen, Come Join Us!By Maria BustillosSep. 18, 2013CurrencyHow Staying Small Helps New Directions Publish Great BooksBy Maria BustillosFeb. 16, 2016NewsCultureBooksBusiness & TechHumorCartoonsMagazineVideoPodcastsArchiveGoings OnShopSign inLink your subscription

Legal battles can be the most high-stress periods of a person’s life. Whether you are faced with crippling injuries or life-altering criminal charges, you need a legal team with the experience, expertise, and drive to protect your rights.




Practice Areas



Criminal Law
Medical Malpractice
Personal Injury Law



Baltimore Criminal Charges Require an Aggressive Legal Defense
Being charged with a crime in Baltimore is a serious matter—your freedom, future, and reputation are all put on the line. Whether you are facing felony or misdemeanor charges, a conviction can have drastic and far reaching consequences for your career and well-being.
Criminal charges require well-informed and dedicated attorneys to win you the best possible ruling for your case. Felony and misdemeanor charges in Baltimore include:





Burglary
Burglary is defined as entering someone else’s property with the intent of committing a crime. The term conjures up images of men in ski masks creeping into residential homes, but many other types of properties are included, such as watercraft, businesses, and warehouses.





DUI
Driving with a BAC above .08 is illegal in the state of Maryland. Without a good DUI attorney, driving under the influence can lead to steep fines, a suspended license, or even jail time. When charged with a DUI, it’s important to contact a knowledgeable criminal lawyer as soon as possible.





Drug Crimes
Drug crime is a blanket term, including (but not limited to) trafficking, possession, and the sale and manufacturing of controlled substances. These charges carry harsh penalties in the state of Maryland, and have life-altering effects for the accused.





Shoplifting / Retail Theft
Depending on the value of the items stolen, shoplifting in Maryland can be charged as a misdemeanor or felony—resulting in high penalties and even prison time. A shoplifting charge on your criminal record can also make it extremely difficult to get a job in the future.





Assault & Battery
Assault and battery are two separate and very serious charges in Maryland. Depending on the individuals involved and the severity of injury, the accused may face jail or prison time, not to mention a permanent violent crime conviction on their record. Contact us to discuss your options to secure the best result possible.





Domestic Violence
Thousands are charged with domestic violence in Maryland every year. A domestic violence conviction carries severe legal penalties, and can ruin your career and reputation.






Holding Negligent Medical Professionals in Baltimore Accountable for Malpractice
We place our health and confidence in the hands doctors and other medical professionals—which makes it all the more catastrophic when those medical professionals behave in a careless or reckless manner on the job.





Birth Injury
When a doctor or nurse acts negligently during a birthing procedure, the newborn can suffer permanent brain injury that results in serious conditions such as cerebral palsy, Erb’s palsy, or autism. A lawyer can provide you and your family with aggressive legal representation and compassionate counsel in the event of a birthing injury to ensure your child gets the best care possible.





Surgical Errors
Surgical errors often lead to serious disability or death. Common examples include inadvertently piercing an organ, severing a nerve, or leaving a foreign object in the body. You can hold a negligent surgeon accountable for their error through a medical malpractice claim. Through a successful claim, you may be able to recover compensation and ensure the surgeon does not continue to harm others.





Medical Negligence
Medical negligence of all kinds has the potential to cause serious and lasting harm, injury, and disability. But when it comes to ligating these cases, there are often many legal obstacles. In many cases, patients have agreed to accept some risk when undergoing certain treatments or procedures.







A Dedicated Personal Injury Attorney for the Greater Baltimore Area
Our dedication to getting concrete financial results for our clients sets us apart. While other personal injury law firms boast high profile cases with huge payouts, they neglect to mention the actual sum of money their clients receive after the firm takes its cut. Our legal team operates a little differently: we make it our personal goal to maximize the amount of money you bring home for you and your family.
At our legal practice, we know injuries and accidents can be devastating to both your finances and physical and emotional well-being. While nothing can make up for the trauma you suffered, financial compensation can help you cover the cost of medical bills, lost wages, and any other costs associated with recovery.
Some common examples of personal injury cases include:





Truck Accidents
Whether it’s a drowsy or intoxicated driver, unsafe equipment, or overloaded cargo, negligent trucking companies and their drivers can be an enormous danger to others on the road. Because unique laws regulate commercial truck driving companies, trucking injury suits require a knowledgeable, experienced truck accident lawyer.





Auto Accidents
These traffic accidents resulted in 55,232 injuries and 635 fatalities. In Baltimore, where the largest population lives, we have the lion’s share of these traffic accidents.





Slip and Fall Accidents
All property and business owners have a duty to maintain a safe environment for others. If they fail to do so, it can lead to slips, falls, and other injuries. If you were injured on the premises of another, you may have a premise liability case.





Credit Card Fraud
Credit card fraud perpetrators are not exclusively individuals acting alone. Sometimes the unscrupulous actions of a major credit card company constitute fraud. Some of these fraudulent actions include hidden fees for cash transactions, masked APRs, and failing to acknowledge past payments.





Food Borne Illness
Foodborne illness is no laughing matter—bacteria from unsafe food handling practices make 1 in 6 Americans sick every year, and serious cases of food poisoning can lead to hospitalization or even death. These complex lawsuits require an attorney with a strong background in foodborne sickness cases.





Traumatic Brain Injury
Trauma to the brain has devastating, long-lasting effects for victims. It’s imperative to contact an attorney as soon as possible, to begin to gather the necessary medical evidence for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) lawsuits.





Asbestos & Lead Poisoning
All property and business owners have a duty to maintain a safe environment for others. If they fail to do so, it can lead to slips, falls, and other injuries. If you were injured on the premises of another, you may have a premise liability case.





Defective Products / Product Liability
From prescription drugs to car tires to playpens, we depend on the things we buy to be safe and work as advertised. When companies cut corners, it can lead to illness, injury, or even death for their customers.





Wrongful Death
Nothing can replace a lost loved one. But wrongful death lawsuits can help cover the unexpected costs of medical bills and funeral expenses, while holding the responsible party accountable.
