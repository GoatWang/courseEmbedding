WHAT OUR USERS SAYOur students are enthusiastically crafting on a platform that allows them to create deep-dive, interactive 360-degree VR stories for the world.With our Samsung Gear360 camera, and the robust tools & features of the Viar360 platform, I can shoot my own video, and then create DIY immersive, engaging, and interactive courses for our employees. Bravo!VIAR360 provides an exciting new way for us to tell the story. The readers get a wealth of visual, text and audio information but can take their own routes through it.  It is non-linear storytelling.STACEY FOXProfessor at Michigan State University / JournalismBILL SHAFERLearning & Development Manager at Samsung USACLYDE BENTLEYProfessor at University of Missouri / Journalism

THOMAS O. JACKSON, Ph.D.,  
MAI, CRE


Tom 
Jackson is the President of Real Property Analytics, Inc. based in College 
Station, Texas, where he specializes in analyzing real estate that may be 
impacted by environmental contamination as well as other complex valuation 
related issues. He has over 35 years of experience 
in the valuation of real property, real estate consulting and urban planning.  
Previously, Dr. Jackson was  the G. Steven Dawson Fellow in Real Estate and a Clinical 
Associate Professor in the Department of Finance 
of
the Mays Business School at Texas A&M University, 
where he taught real property valuation in the
Master of Real Estate 
Program, one of the oldest and 
largest graduate real estate programs in the U.S. He also taught 
courses on land development 
and land use planning in the College
of Architecture. Dr. Jackson is an MAI Member of the

and legally enforceable standards for real estate appraisers in the U.S. Dr. 
Jackson was the principal author of the ASB's Advisory Opinion 9: The 
Appraisal of Real Property That May Be Impacted by Environmental Contamination 
(see AO-9 below). He was also the  principal author of the Appraisal Institute's Guide Note 6: Consideration of Hazardous Substances in the Appraisal 
Process (see GN-6 below). Together, AO-9 and GN-6 represent the generally 
accepted approach within the appraisal profession for analyzing the effects of 
environmental contamination on real property. Dr. Jackson served on the 
Professional Standards and Guidance Committee of the Appraisal Institute from 
2012 to 2015.
Dr. Jackson's research  has been published in

currently a member of the Review Panel and Statistics Work Group of

The Appraisal of Real Estate, 13th Edition (2008) and 14th Edition 
(2013) as well as The 
Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 5th Edition  (2010) and 6th Edition 
(2015). These textbooks reflect the valuation framework and concepts set forth 
in AO-9 and GN-6.
Through the Appraisal Institute, Dr. Jackson 
developed the national seminar Analyzing the Effects of 
Environmental Contamination on Real Property which he presented to Institute 
chapters in Texas, Florida and Louisiana. Dr. Jackson also presented or 
co-presented the Appraisal Institute webinars

Contaminated 
Property and the Valuation Process and

In addition, he has taught (with Dr. Marvin Wolverton) the Appraisal 
Institute's Advanced 
Education Course on 
Quantitative Analysis, 
focusing on the use of multiple regression analysis in valuation assignments. 
Dr. Jackson served on the Education Committee of the Appraisal Institute from 
2007 to 2011.

Science from Texas A&M
University, master's degrees from The University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and The Ohio State University,
and is an honors graduate of the University

analyzing the effects of environmental contamination on commercial and 
industrial real estate and was 
funded by the National
Science Foundation and the Lincoln
Institute of Land Policy. Dr. Jackson's research on the effects of wind 
turbines and solar 
panels on residential real estate was funded by the 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory of the 
U.S. Department of Energy.
Dr. Jackson has provided 
expert witness testimony over 100 times in litigation matters involving: the impacts of soil, 
groundwater, airborne and surface water contamination and alleged contamination 
on property values; real estate issues related to proposed environmental class 
actions; the impacts of high voltage electric transmission lines on property 
values; the valuation 
and highest and best use of properties subject to eminent domain; real estate development 
feasibility; planning and land use regulation; and other real property related issues.
