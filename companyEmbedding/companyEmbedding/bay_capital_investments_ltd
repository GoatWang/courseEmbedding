Bay Capital is an active fiduciary. However,  we invest the way we want our capital to be managed — with the utmost care. In the private equity business, we source our own deals by offering strategic inputs for our investees and in the process become trusted advisors.  This creates a long-term relationship and, often, an attractive entry price. In investing in public markets, we look for companies with moats that are incredibly difficult to breach. Our typical holding period is quite long – creating overall cost efficiencies.  We are motivated by generating performance and our overarching philosophy is to always keep our investors’ interest ahead of our own.

EXTENSIVE TRACK RECORD IN LONG-ONLY, PUBLIC MARKETS INVESTING IN INDIA
—







 
 
 
 

Concentrated, bottom-up, long-only approach


Local network providing quality, accuracy, and transparency for an information advantage













Investing in India today reminds me of the US in 1982: double-digit interest rates beginning to fall, a successful central bank fighting inflation and much needed labor reforms being implemented. However, there is one important difference. India's GDP/Capita in 2014 is equal to that of the US in 1880.”

- James Sheridan, Partner








OUR EDGE
—












FOCUSED APPROACH
—
In our long-only efforts, we are only interested in great companies that have sustainably high ROICs. In the PE business, we invest only in those companies where we believe we can add value to the sponsor while making money for investors









LOCAL PRESENCE
—
Intense research, due diligence and logistic support possible


















EXPERIENCE
—
We believe we have the experience to assist our companies and the judgment to assess sustainability of returns











PATIENCE
—

In our long-only business, we believe in an ‘equity yield curve’ where returns increase with time and therefore seek investors who share our belief in the power of compounding

 

Our PE investments are financed on a deal by deal basis. We never rush to invest committed capital. This patient approach gives us a significant advantage over traditional PE funds
















Private Equity investing in India is filled with challenges.  Bay Capital recognises this and has altered its approach.  First, we never participate in auctions, we source our own deals.  Second, we invest only on a deal by deal basis (usually after long periods of building trust with sponsors).  We therefore feel no pressure to invest based on the cycle of PE fundraising and investing.  We believe this discipline ensures a stable, reliable, investment process and return to our investors.”

 
— Siddharth Mehta, Founder
















 







 
 
ALL INVESTMENTS FINANCED ‘DEAL BY DEAL’
Two benefits: We are in no rush to invest before the end of ‘an investment period’ and secondly, this allows increased transparency for investors.













 
 
CREATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OURSELVES
We don't participate in auctions 












 
OUR GOAL IS TO BECOME A LONG-TERM TRUSTED ADVISOR BY OFFERING STRATEGIC INPUT AND UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO OUR INVESTEES
 






 
 
 
WILLING AND ABLE TO TAKE MANAGEMENT CONTROL
 












 
 
SEVERAL RECENT PROFITABLE EXITS IN A DIFFICULT PERIOD





OUR PRIVATE EQUITY STRATEGY
—














We have found that the best Indian listed businesses have turned India’s ‘idiosyncrasies’  of weak logistics and multiple languages/cultures into significant barriers to entry. Our companies have sustainably high returns by capitalizing on branding, technology and distribution advantages, often built over long periods of time.”

 
— Puneet Saraogi, Co-Founder & Managing Partner, Bay Capital Partners LLP

OUR LONG-ONLY STRATEGY
—




















Let us combine ‘Look East’ with ‘Link West’ and with our global vision, we can provide a new platform for our economic structure”

 
 Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India

You will see India as a country of opportunities, unmatched across the world. India can be a role model of growth and cohesiveness for the rest of the world."

 Flexible Capital
 for the Lower Middle Market








Bay Capital Investment Partners


Capital for the Lower Middle Market
 Bay Capital Investment Partners specifically addresses the capital needs of smaller U.S. companies by providing senior debt, subordinated debt, mezzanine capital and equity capital to facilitate acquisitions, management buyouts and recapitalizations  and to provide growth capital.

Investment  Strategy
Bay Capital seeks to invest $3 million to $10 million in historically profitable companies with strong management and a well-defined growth strategy.


Geographic Focus
Based in Providence, RI, Bay Capital invests primarily in businesses located east of the Mississippi River.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.
