Board - Europe, Board VC/PE backed Companies


– SWEDEN, Stockholm – Snow Software, the global leader in Software Asset Management and Cloud Spend Management solutions, today announced a $120 million strategic investment from Sumeru Equity Partners and Ontario Pension Board. The investment will accelerate global expansion plans, enhance Snow’s offering across mobile and cloud platforms and drive new product innovation. Existing shareholders, including CEO and co-founder Axel Kling, Snow employees and Vitruvian Partners, will continue to hold a majority shareholding in the business and remain fully committed to Snow’s evolution. SEP Managing Directors, Jason Babcoke and George Kadifa, will join Snow’s board of directors.
Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Snow, Axel Kling, commented: “We are grateful not only to have been part of making Software Asset Management one of the fastest-growing software verticals in the world, but also to get the opportunity to redefine the customers’ expectations of SAM solutions through coverage of new platforms, licensing types and advanced automation capabilities.
“We have come a long way but we are still only scratching the surface on the enormous potential in supporting customers to ensure that the $394.8 billion1 spent every year on enterprise software is invested efficiently. With Vitruvian and SEP, we are thrilled to have the backing of two world-class investors as Snow enters the next stage of its development on our continued quest for brilliance.”
Founded in 2004, Snow is the established global market leader in SAM, helping over 6,000 organizations across more than 50 countries contain and optimize software spend and achieve compliance with complex software licensing terms across mobile, desktop, data center and cloud solutions. Snow’s solutions provide highly automated reconciliation of license entitlements to actual software usage, installations/ removals and license upgrades as well as advanced analytics which help customers save up to 30% of their annual software expenditure.
Customers further use Snow’s solution as a decision-making analytics tool to direct investment in new software and maximizing ROI. Snow’s cloud-based and on-premise platforms have been recognized and rewarded by among others Forrester, Gartner and ITAM Review. Snow has grown its revenues by more than 50% annually since 2012 and today has over 700 employees in 21 countries. Recent notable client wins include Canon, Sky, Lockheed Martin, IKEA, Volkswagen, Tesco and Rio Tinto.
Managing Partner at SEP, Kyle Ryland, commented: “We identified Snow several years ago as a leader in managing the complexity and cost of software and cloud services, a growing challenge for enterprises. Under the leadership of Axel, Snow has demonstrated strong growth and product innovation and we are excited to partner with the company and Vitruvian to build upon that success.”
Mike Risman, Chairman of Snow Software added: “Vitruvian is delighted to continue supporting Axel and the Snow team in their drive to global leadership in this exciting market. We welcome SEP and OPB as key partners to help achieve success. Snow’s relentless focus on product excellence has delivered tremendous growth since inception, and it has been a privilege for us to work on a number of strategic initiatives with the business over the past years. The addressable market for software governance and cloud control solutions is massive. We congratulate Axel and his team on the scope of their founding vision and achieving this additional milestone on their impressive journey to global implementation.”

Snow provides Software Asset Management (SAM) solutions that prevent any of the $394.8 billion spent every year on enterprise software being a wasted investment – ensuring organizations have appropriate licensing for the software they use.
More than 6,000 organizations worldwide rely on Snow to optimize licensing across mobile, desktop, data center and cloud platforms.

– USA, CA – Buildium, a market leading SaaS property management platform for real estate professionals, today announced that Sumeru Equity Partners (SEP) – along with existing investors and company management – has made a $65M strategic investment to accelerate product innovation and growth. SEP Managing Directors, Jason Babcoke and John Brennan, will join Buildium’s board of directors.
“Buildium has successfully made the transition from startup to established market leader, and its large and rapidly growing base of happy customers is a testament to the company’s customer-first philosophy,” said Jason Babcoke, managing director at SEP. “Founder-led teams with strong product backgrounds are attractive investments for us – especially since Buildium was founded in the practice of property management and truly understands the pain points of the market first-hand. This combination leads to successful product companies—as evidenced by Buildium’s clear leadership in this space.”
An Urban Institute study suggests that 59 percent of new household formations over the next 15 years will be renters. This will have a significant impact on real estate professionals, who will be increasingly inundated with even more day-to-day tasks. Buildium is uniquely suited to address these challenges by automating the entire lifecycle of property management within a single platform. Through the platform, real estate professionals streamline time-consuming tasks such as rent/fee collection, tenant screening, maintenance requests, and vacancy advertising so they can focus on higher-value tasks that help grow their business. In addition, the software helps these companies respond to requests of increasingly digital tenants and association owners, who want to make payments online and communicate electronically with property managers. Buildium’s software is intuitive, comprehensive, and purposefully designed to suit the unique needs of property managers, owners, and tenants. Through its 2015 acquisition of All Property Management—a leading online marketing service for property managers—Buildium is also the only company that gives property managers modern tools to acquire new customers and grow revenue.
“Since our inception, we have always been a customer-centric organization,” said Michael Monteiro, co-founder and CEO of Buildium. “We found SEP’s focus on product and go-to-market positioned them as an ideal partner for Buildium as we launch our next phase of growth. With their financial backing, we will increase investment to continue delivering a thoughtfully designed, complete, and easy-to-use property management platform that meets our customers’ needs with industry leading customer care.”
About Buildium
Buildium is the only property management solution that automates the entire property management lifecycle as well as enabling real estate professionals to win new business from property owners and community associations. Backed by expert advice and relentless support, Buildium enables real estate professionals to outperform across all facets of their business with intuitive software that balances power, simplicity and ease of use. Buildium services more than 12,500 customers in 46 countries, totaling nearly one million residential units under management. In 2015, Buildium acquired All Property Management, a leading online marketing service for property managers, making Buildium the only company to give property managers a way to acquire new customers and increase revenues.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
