Hotwire, Inc. Company Profile

   Hotwire likes to give travelers a steal. The firm operates discount travel websites offering airline tickets, car rentals, hotel reservations, vacation packages, and cruises. Its sites include Hotwire.com, CarRentals.com, and Travel-Ticker.com. The company lists unsold inventory (empty seats on planes and in hotels, extra cars on the lot) from such leading brands as Delta, Continental, Hilton, and Avis. Consumers select travel services based on specific fare and rate information without knowing the identity of the travel provider until their purchase is completed, which allows Hotwire to sell the services at a substantial discount. Founded in 2000, Hotwire is owned by online travel services giant Expedia.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls.
