Executive Insight: Susan Sobbott



    
      Caroline Waxler
    
  
Oct 2012







Susan Sobbott, president of American Express OPEN, explains why she's a passionate advocate of shopping small and going digital.

"This part of the room was supposed to be furnished,” says Susan Sobbott as she points to the space adjacent to her kitchen table. We’re at her century-old Arts and Crafts-style home (an ‘antique’ that she’s nearly finished restoring) in a leafy New Jersey suburb. “But this is our playroom. The kids come in. Our daughter can do cartwheels. Our son can set up his LEGO. It’s a totally flexible space. My husband keeps saying, ‘When are we going to get furniture for this?’ And I keep saying, ‘We can’t. It’s open.’”
The 48-year-old president of American Express OPEN certainly has a thing for flexible spaces. As head of the corporation’s third-largest business unit — and its only sub-brand — she may have been at this venerable institution for 22 years, but she thinks like a start-up entrepreneur. It’s this thinking that has made OPEN not only the leading card issuer for small businesses nationwide but has established its OPEN Forum as the go-to online resource and social network for small business owners and entrepreneurs.
This year, Sobbott’s division is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary. Having started life in 1987, catering to an underserved market as American Express Small Business Services, it was rebranded in 2002. “The brand was created prior to me and so everyone who owns it will have a different interpretation of [its meaning]. My interpretation is that ‘OPEN’ comes from that seminal moment for a business owner when they declare that they are ‘open for business.’
“We try to learn from companies,” she continues, speaking of the customers she serves. “Not only because I’ve fallen in love with them, but because they inspire us to get to know them better.” To that end, American Express OPEN took up residence at one of the co-working spaces owned by tech incubator WeWork Labs. “We do that so our team can walk outside their little glass cube and interact with business owners who are around them and say, ‘What do you think about this or that?’” Her team also works closely with another co-working space, General Assembly.
It doesn’t stop at conversation. OPEN offers its employees the opportunity to participate in an ‘externship’ program. Here, employees act like a small consulting team, living with a business for a period of time and gaining the insights required to solve potential problems they may be experiencing.
Sobbott knows that this is good business. “We’re trying to help businesses grow and we’re trying to help provide them with whatever we can to get them the support they need.” In turn, as they grow, they’ll become better customers.

Many business owners are quite intimidated by digital technology. We have a survey that says more people would rather do their taxes then develop a social media campaign.

Small business owners are a diverse group. “There are 25 million of them,” Sobbott says. “They range from your dentist to the woman who is making jewelry on her dining room table to a tech start-up.” And not all of them are eager to embrace digital. “Many business owners are quite intimidated by it,” she admits. “We have a survey that says more people would rather do their taxes then develop a social media campaign.”
To that end, says Sobbott, “We’re focusing our time and attention on really helping them understand what digital marketing assets exist, and letting people know where to find them. In fact,” she continues, “one of the things we did recently on OPEN Forum was to put in something called ‘Crash Courses.’ Crash Courses are bite-sized ‘how-to’s’ on various topics. It’s a simple principle that as the business grows, we grow with them and our bottom line is impacted in that way.”
That’s not to say that the bottom line is the only consideration. For Sobbott, success is measured first and foremost by the “quality of the experience” that American Express provides its customers, as well as the number of people the business reaches through its work.
Central to those goals are the company’s own plans in the digital space. In particular, the decision to partner with all the major social media platforms to serve up innovative offerings to customers.
One such campaign on Facebook, ‘Link, Like, Love,’ serves up discounts based on the user’s interests that are automatically put on the member’s card and redeemed at the point of purchase. “You don’t have to bring a coupon, you don’t have to remember a code, and the person at the point-of-sale doesn’t have to do anything,” Sobbott explains. The initiative is symptomatic of everything American Express does: “We want to bring value to our customers, and the way we bring value is by getting them access to things that they couldn’t otherwise get access to.”
Sobbott’s major contribution to OPEN is undoubtedly her creation of Small Business Saturday. Taking place over Thanksgiving weekend, it’s the day when consumers are encouraged and rewarded for shopping at small businesses. “Put yourself back in 2010; nobody knew where the world was going,” says Sobbott. “I kept thinking, ‘What can American Express do to help our customers?’ I knew it had to be something bigger than us, so I challenged the team: ‘Tell me how we can bring all of American Express to benefit our small business customers.’” What their customers needed, says Sobbott, was traffic.
The germ of the idea was to ask American Express customers to shop at small businesses. “And then I thought, ‘Why are we stopping at our customers? Why don’t we just ask all of America to shop at small businesses?’” Great idea, but Thanksgiving was only six weeks away. “We knew that the only way we could do something that could scale was through social media.”
First up was a Facebook promotion that saw American Express offer $100 in free Facebook advertising to the first 10,000 business owners to sign up to the campaign. Facebook Ads helped those businesses build online buzz and drive engagement, while American Express supported them with a Facebook Pages set-up guide and a central hub that housed, among other things, toolkit components and a directory of businesses involved in the promotion. The Small Business Saturday Facebook page now has over 2.8 million ‘Likes.’
Over on YouTube, meanwhile, American Express teamed up with Google to create ‘My Business Story,’ a free tool that allows small business owners to create professional-quality videos. It’s just one of the company’s 57 playlists that have so far racked up almost 20 million views.
Still, Sobbott’s team knew that to get Small Business Saturday off to a flying start with the public, they needed a killer incentive. So they offered customers $25 in credit if they spent $25 in stores and restaurants. It worked so well that by year two 100 million Americans shopped small, with the campaign achieving 65 percent awareness. “We had over 200 public organizations join us, 75 corporate partners, and every state in the country,” says Sobbott. There was even a bipartisan Senate Resolution passed to encourage consumers to shop at locally owned, independent businesses.
Sobbott laughs. “As much as I’d love to tell you how we were so smart and so strategic — I mean, we were smart and strategic — but, boy, we struck gold. We tapped into a passion and energy that was already very prevalent. Everyone wants to kick start the economy. We just gave people a simple action to help do their part – by encouraging them to shop small. And it was huge.

Susan Sobbott: An Integrated Life






By Susan Sobbott










120






















People everywhere struggle to find work-life balance. A better approach, in my mind, is to pursue work-life integration. Rather than a work life and a personal life, two separate entities, the goal should be to have one very full life and work consciously to integrate all of the things that make it meaningful.
I purposefully make my work-life integration visible to our team at American Express. By bringing my family into my work and my work into my home, by sharing my story, others can see that I value what they value -- a full, diverse life. When my children spend time with me at my office or work events, they are able to see that I have other responsibilities beyond my role as Mom.  
Several years ago, I found that I was having more discussions with colleagues, mostly women, struggling to meet the demands of both family and work. At certain stages of life, they felt forced to make a choice between their career goals and their family aspirations. These conversations prompted me to create a third option -- one that engages experienced, high-potential employees part-time, for specific, high-impact projects.  
An accomplished senior leader, Elly, who loved her job, came to me to tell me her child was facing challenges that only she could address by being home every day after school. She faced a choice that no one should have to make -- the well-being of her child or her career. I realized that, as an employer, if we force a person to choose between their family and their job, we lose every time, regardless of the choice they make. I don't want to be put in that situation, and I won't put anyone else in that situation either. So, a third option emerged. We created a role for Elly that allowed her to leave at 2 p.m. every day to pick up her son from school. While she has benefitted from this third option, I would say we as a company have benefitted more in the passion, commitment and focus that Elly brings to work every day.  
This idea of a third option is often what attracts women to entrepreneurship. Women are the fastest growing segment of small business, starting businesses at one and a half times the rate of men. They are creating the companies they want to work for, filling meaningful voids in the marketplace and creating meaningful changes to workplace standards for themselves and their employees. For example, companies like AKRAYA, an IT staffing company co-founded by Sonu Ratra. AKRAYA sends professional cleaners to employees' homes every two weeks and provides them with a family gym membership. 
The challenge for women, whether running their own companies or working for someone else, is to abandon the feeling that we must do it all and must control it all. Learning to identify what is truly meaningful and how to cleverly integrate those desires into the 24 hours we're allotted in a day is key. So, here's my advice:
Think of yourself as your most important asset and be conscious of how you deploy your energy and time. It starts with an assessment of what is truly meaningful divided into what only you can do and what can be accomplished by others. It isn't about doing it all -- in fact, it's the opposite. It's about being focused. To unlock your energy, concentrate on the things you are best at, that only you can do, and work towards checking things off of that shorter, more manageable list. 
Reframe how you think about delegating. Think of "outsourcing" as providing opportunity to others, not just asking favors (though it can feel that way sometimes). It is about thinking creatively about what can be accomplished by others in ways that help them grow. Give high-potential young talent the chance to spread their wings, or an administrative assistant a chance to branch out into a whole new area through event planning, or your child the chance to learn important life skills by doing the laundry, or cede control of the grocery shopping to your husband. When you think about outsourcing as providing opportunities for others, you can help free up women from the feeling that they have to do it all. 
Make sure there is time for YOU on your must-do list. When thinking about what only you can do, don't forget what only you can do for you. Whether it is a cup of tea in silence, exercising, reading a novel or spending time with friends, carving out time for the simple things that rejuvenate us will give us the energy we need to accomplish all of the other things we aspire to.
 
Instead of chasing the holy grail of work-life balance, know that there is a third option centered on work-life integration. Considering all of the aspects that make up your life, really looking at where you're directing your energy, and focusing on what's most important to you at work, and at home, will make you more successful and fulfilled -- both in business and in life.

Interview: 
Susan Sobbott

President, American Express OPEN




                        Small-business owners need good advice, and Susan works with American Express OPEN to give them just that. As the advocate for small business-owners, Susan has led the company to create business products, customer services and marketing initiatives specifically geared toward entrepreneurs. Susan’s greatest fulfillment is OPEN’s Women’s Business Initiative, which supports women entrepreneurs who want  READ MORE » 






ON Journey

Q: Please share with us the story of how your professional journey began and has brought you to where you are today.
A: My 19-year career at American Express has been rich with experiences. I’m fortunate to work at a company that values diverse and innovative perspectives. I’m proud of my role as an agent for change by leading innovations in flexible work arrangements, social media marketing and the development of digital solutions. I also enjoy my role as a mentor and role model for many women leaders inside and outside of American Express.
For the last six years, my energy has been focused on small business as the President of OPEN. OPEN is the leader in small business in the U.S. through our payment products and digital solutions that make us a vital resource for business owners. We authorize an average of $1.8 billion in spending each week and provide ~$30 billion each quarter in credit to our customers. OPEN has been the recipient of numerous awards for innovation in our products, services, marketing initiatives and advocacy efforts on behalf of entrepreneurs.
Throughout my career, I have played a leadership role in many of the milestones that have directly contributed to the company’s growth: helping devise American Express’ corporate strategy, developing and managing strategic partnerships with many corporate partners; bringing in major partners to our company including Costco, now a long standing and deep American Express partner.





ON Entrepreneurship

Q: What’s your best advice for an entrepreneur in an early/bootstrapping phase?
A: Focus: Think of yourself as your most important asset and strive to deploy it in the best possible way; Focus on what you do best and let others do the rest.
Be Resourceful: Use your inner drive to take your ideas and make them bigger than you ever imagined; Look for opportunities and potential in every situation and in everyone around you.
Be Resilient: Don’t consider failure an option or be distracted by obstacles; Try to bounce back quickly from setbacks and channel energy into problem solving.





ON Vision

Q: I love the quote “the bigger the vision, the smaller the first step.” Right now, what is the big vision you have for your career?
A: Helping others realize their potential starts by helping them believe in it.





ON Mentoring

Q: Who has been your greatest mentor(s)?
A: I don’t believe in having one mentor, rather I believe in looking for opportunities and potential to learn from every situation and in everyone around you…listen to the voices in your path.
That said, I’ve been fortunate to have had many important voices throughout my career that have guided me.  I have tucked away key pieces of advice from a wide variety of perspectives that I draw upon often.  Of course, some people in my life have been more prolific in their counsel…because they believed in me so much that they made an investment in me.
I often give counsel to others for that same reason.  I aspire to help them reach their full potential. My guidance always starts with asking them “what do you want?”  Most of the time, that’s the question they are least prepared to answer, and that is the seminal question to unlocking their potential.





ON Starting Out

Q: If you had a young sister who was a senior in college, anxious about landing her first job or unsure of what she wanted to do, what would your advice be to her?
A: Know who you are…know what you are really good at, know what your limits are and know when you need help. And importantly, know your potential.
Believe in who you are…Remember, you are a package. And there are things that are great, and things that are not as great in that package. But you can’t have one without the other.
Be true to who you are…Being true to yourself means fitting in, in the way that you fit, not changing who you are to fit into someone else’s expectations.





ON Perseverance

Q: Life is full of setbacks. Can you share an experience of one, and how you were able to bounce back?
A: Managing through the recession. In a crisis you have to combine everything you’ve learned, and bring it all to bear at once to serve you and everyone you are leading. In this fast-paced environment you are instantly right or instantly wrong – which makes “sound judgment” the most important quality to possess. Even in the most confusing moments of the economic crisis, I had clear principals that helped guide my decision-making. They grounded me so deeply that I just knew what needed to be done. I relied heavily on staying focused and remained true to my values. I feel like I crammed 5 years of experience into less than 18 months. Now I realize that if I made it through that crisis – I can make it through other challenges and I have surfaced a better leader for it.





ON Motherhood

Q: How do you balance career and motherhood?
A: At American Express, we support employees and strive to give them the opportunity to integrate what’s important to them. The key is to look within yourself, to be clear about your priorities, versus looking externally. Once you have very clear priorities, think of your time as your most important asset and strive to deploy it in the best possible way. I believe it’s about integration versus balance. I don’t view it as a work life and a family life. I have one very full life and work consciously to integrate all of the things that make it meaningful.
My time goes to the kids, despite my urge to run home and do laundry, cook dinner and go grocery shopping. When will I learn that being a mom isn’t about folding pajamas? Kids would rather have you reading a story with wrinkled pajamas. I try to resist the urge to boil the ocean. It’s not about doing it all, it’s about having focus.
A colleague at American Express shared the following with me, “Don’t live for the weekends with the kids, live for good memories and moments everyday that count.” So, every day I make sure that my children get a piece of me at home. On a daily basis, I stop to think about what I want them to remember about today.

Susan Sobbott





















Integrating Budgets and Ballet Shoes “Yesterday, my daughter Leah asked if she could come to work with me, so I brought her in,” said Susan Sobbott (MBA ’90) of her 9-year-old. “Leah sharpened about four boxes of pencils and sat through some meetings with me. She said she had the ‘very best day.’ Last night, she asked what time we were leaving for work this morning.”As president of Global Corporate Payments at American Express, a wife and a mother, Sobbott knows about the challenges of managing a family and a career. At home, she raises her two children, Leah and Jeremiah, with her husband, Keith. In her current position, she is responsible for all of the products that serve the company’s corporate payment clients around the world, including the Corporate Card and Corporate Purchasing Solutions. A leader in the corporate payments arena, American Express operates in nearly 200 countries and serves 62 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Since she started working for the company more than 20 years ago, Sobbott has established herself as a leader who spearheads creative marketing strategies, uncovers pockets of untapped growth and cares deeply about her customers. Sobbott’s downtown Manhattan office, which overlooks the Statue of Liberty, is full of family photographs coupled with several awards she’s won, including a Corporate Leadership Award from the United Way of New York City, the Office Depot Corporate Visionary Award, B2B Magazine’s Best B2B Marketer of the Year Award and the Women of Achievement Award, given by Girls Inc.Her life outside of American Express is deeply intertwined with her professional career, which is what she prefers. “When my children spend time with me at my office or work events, they are able to see that I have other responsibilities beyond my role as Mom,” she wrote in a Huffington Post 2013 blog post.Why Balance Isn't the Right Term"My life and my work have to be integrated because I can’t find another way to do it,” Sobbott said. “Honestly, it’s very practical. Balance implies that I have two separate parts of my life. I would have to get them on an equal level, and to me, nothing competes with my family. I believe if you ever ask a person to make a choice between their work and their family, you’re always going to lose. It has to be their family.”  Sobbott decided that if she isn’t willing to compromise, her employees shouldn’t have to, either. She formalized her integrated approach at American Express by creating a Project Resource Team for employees who need more flexibility. The Project Resource Team is a program that “gives employees who want to work part-time the opportunity to continue their careers.” Team members work on a rotational basis — to fill in for someone on maternity leave, for example, or to lead a special project.The team had an immediate impact on American Express and its employees. “It transformed the way the entire team looked at work-life integration,” Sobbott said. “It allows individuals who would have opted out to stay in, to stay connected. It is a small way to make life more palatable and a little bit easier, which can make a big difference.” Giving her employees more flexibility also meant they were more well-rounded. “These employees become super heroes because they have rotational experience that rounds them out as executives,” Sobbott explained. “They’re often highly sought after when they rotate back in.” Team members average about two to three years and then decide whether they want to return as full-time employees or continue on a part-time basis. The idea has been successfully adopted by several other American Express departments.Selling With Confidence Another key to Sobbott’s success is her leadership style, which she credits Darden for teaching her. “My business and leadership philosophy emerged from my Darden roots of an integrated learning process. Just like the curriculum, nothing gets to be siloed. We have a business ecosystem. No one gets to go off and do their own thing. Everything is mutually reinforcing,” said Sobbott.At Darden, she also learned about the power of confidence, which she considers a critical asset for leaders. “You could have the best solution to the world’s most dramatic problem, but if you are unsure of yourself, no one is going to have confidence in you,” Sobbott said. Darden’s cold call environment and study groups taught her how to solve problems and obtain the right resources. “The other side of the confidence issue is communication,” Sobbott observed. “The ability to communicate clearly in a compelling way is so important. It’s perhaps the most important skill I learned at Darden, and it serves me every day.”Small Businesses, Big ResultsPrior to her current role, Sobbott served as president of American Express OPEN. During her 10-year tenure, she transformed it into the leading credit card issuer for small businesses, launching more than 20 successful card products, increasing revenues more than 50 percent, and doubling profits.The daughter of a business owner, she has always had a passion for helping small businesses, which is part of why she created Small Business Saturday. Every year, over Thanksgiving weekend, consumers are encouraged to shop at small, independent businesses.In 2013, American Express engaged elected officials in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. — including President Obama and many senior government officials, almost 200 corporate partners and 1400 neighborhoods across the country. Small Business Saturday has won dozens of awards, including a Grand Prix award at the Cannes International Festival of Creativity and an Effie Award from the American Marketing Association.Sobbott’s pioneering work at American Express has helped women entrepreneurs across the country. In 2013, her company created OPEN for Women, a CEO boot camp for female business owners offering training, tools and support to advance their businesses. At the events, Sobbott shares what she and others have learned about women in business in the hope of helping them succeed. “Women tend to start businesses out of a passion or a need they see in their lives,” said Sobbott. “We try to help them marry their passion with profits.”Modern Female LeadershipIn addition to her other roles, Sobbott is a highly engaged alumna who serves on the Darden School Foundation Board of Trustees. She cares deeply about how the School can help both women and men become better leaders. She also serves on the boards of Red Ventures and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.“I think some of the most valued characteristics in modern leadership are typically considered to be female traits,” Sobbott said. “Whether or not they are embodied in a male or female executive, the notion of creativity, of connecting disparate pieces of information, nonlinear thinking and creating a highly collaborative environment … tend to be more associated with female traits.” She believes that Darden could attract more women to the School if it explored this theme more fully and brought out “female” leadership traits “that are critical to success in our fast-paced world of innovation.”     Sobbott is amicable and energetic. She spends time getting to know her employees. Talking to parents on her team was how she originally decided to create the Project Resource Team. She observes those around her, and meets their needs as best she can, all while juggling a daunting to-do list. “I have my list of things to accomplish this week,” Sobbott said. “We’re planning the budget, and I have to get Leah’s ballet shoes. They’re both on my priority list. One is no more important than the other.” So how does she manage to get it all done? She said her yoga practice helps keep her grounded, though she does not consider herself a yogi. She also recognizes her challenges. “My integrated approach is just a practical way for me to make it all work, because let me tell you, it’s hard. Anybody who thinks it’s not clearly has not done it.”At the end of the day, however, positively impacting others is what matters most to Sobbott. “Success for me is not measured in money or status. It is measured in meaning. In my mind, success is understanding how you serve others and doing it really well.”
