And why is he a threat to Pharmos chief Dr. Haim Aviv?



        
            When the CEO of a company makes an important strategic move, such an acquisition or a share offering, he hopes for the best possible outcome. He hopes that the company shareholders will think that the move is an excellent one, demonstrating the CEO�s management skill, that the share price will rise, and, the course of time, that everyone will ultimately be awed at his genius in leading the company in this direction. What vision! How he gambled that the acquisition would be successful, won the whole pot, and made the shareholders happy. But the word �shareholders� covers many kinds of investors: large institutions, small institutions, US investors, Israeli investors (in the case of Israeli companies), involved investors and uninterested ones, long-term investors, and investors seeking a quick buck. Obviously, it�s impossible to satisfy them all. One man who has personally undergone this problem in recent weeks is Pharmos Corp. (Nasdaq: PARS) chairman and CEO Dr. Haim Aviv. Well, you might say, criticism from investors is nothing new for Aviv, especially since the shattering failure in late 2004 of dexanabinol, the head trauma treatment meant for a billion-dollar market. The hope had been to create an international commercial biopharmaceutical company, but that dream is gone. Criticism also came in the form of class action suits that Pharmos is still dealing with. However, this time the criticism is not reflected in the sale of Pharmos shares or lawsuits. There is an investor making a lot of noise: please meet Lloyd Miller III, of Florida. The agenda of the �new leadership committee� Pharmos is a drug discovery and development company, with a focus on neurology and inflammations. Although without revenue, for many months the company has said that it is actively seeking pharmaceutical activities for acquisition. The hope is to find a drug undergoing promising Phase II clinical trials, in order to increase the chance of achieving commercialization more quickly. In mid-March 2006, Pharmos announced that it had found what it was looking for in Vela Pharmaceuticals Inc. of New Jersey. Pharmos will acquire Vela for an initial payment of $5 million in cash, plus the issue of 11.5 million Pharmos shares (at $2.15 per share), for a total of $29.7 million. Later, Pharmos will issue 8 million additional shares, contingent on achieving specific clinical milestones. Pharmos has a market cap of $45 million. Vela develops drugs for the treatment of intestinal syndromes, especially irritated bowel syndrome. In contrast to other drugs, Vela�s drug treats this problem via the brain and central nervous system, rather than directly treating the intestine. In the next few weeks, the company will commence Phase IIb clinical trials of its drug, following the successful completion of Phase IIa trials, conducted under Pharmos�s guidance. The companies hope for a market of hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even a blockbuster. So who is Lloyd Miller? Last February, Aviv didn�t know him either. On February 9, Miller first filed an SC13D report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that he had acquired 7.9% of Pharmos. With this purchase, he became the largest shareholder in the company. Aviv owns 2.3%, and no other shareholder owns more than 5%. Investment institutions have lost interest in the company and sold their holdings, and its current value has not attracted new blood, in the form of institutions willing to take a risk. Pharmos president and COO Alan Rubino met Miller, and tried to understand his plans, but Miller apparently said nothing. In March, Miller announced that he now owned 8.4% of the company; in other words, he was amassing shares. The SC13D form states, �Miller is an advisor to the trustee of Trust A-4.� As far as we can tell, this is family money for which he is the trustee. Miller�s SC13D from March states that he planned to oppose Pharmos�s merger with Vela, announced a few days previously. Rubino was again dispatched to talk with Miller, and again got the impression that, except for the acquisition, Miller had no plans to do anything. Meanwhile, Miller continued to amass Pharmos shares. He can reach a maximum of 15% of the company�s share capital, because if he buys more, Pharmos�s board can activate a poison pill created in October 2002. Miller has not sat by silently. On Friday, he exercised his threat, sending to the SEC a proxy on his behalf and on behalf of two other Pharmos shareholders; Dr. Raymond McKee and Dr. Gerard Soula. The three men own 9.1% of the company altogether (1.74 million shares); in other words McKee and Soula own 0.7%. The three men joined forces to create a bloc that calls itself �the committee for new leadership�, a name that clearly defines the agenda they want to dictate for Pharmos. They are urging shareholders to block the acquisition of Vela at Pharmos�s next general shareholders meeting, scheduled for the summer, because the three men do not care for this acquisition. They also want to be appointed directors, replacing three current directors, including Aviv, because �the service of the current directors is characterized by cash burning and a dramatic fall in the share price.�  �The acquisition has a devastating impact� Factually, regardless of whether Miller is right or not, Vela�s condition is far from excellent. On March 15, the company�s auditor, Ernst & Young, reported that the company had an operating loss, a huge cumulative deficit, negative shareholders� equity, and a negative cash flow from current operations. Under these circumstances, Ernst & Young doubted Vela�s ability to survive as a going concern. A merger with Pharmos is Vela�s lifeline. Vela lost $9 million in 2005, and burned $9.7 million cash. If the merger goes ahead, Vela shareholders JP Morgan Partners LLC will get 16.3% of Pharmos, Venrock Associates will get 7.5%, and New Enterprise Associates will get 11%. Miller and his associates claim that Vela shareholders, especially the three mentioned above, will benefit at the expense of Pharmos shareholders, since Pharmos will probably issue up to 19. 5 million shares for them, which will greatly dilute the holdings of the company�s existing shareholders. Given Vela�s weak financial performance and balance sheet, Miller and his associates claim that the new Pharmos - including Vela - will suffer from an even faster and heavier cash burn rate, which is unquestionably bad for shareholders. They claim that Vela failed to raise additional capital on its own, until the arrival of Pharmos.  Miller and his associates also assert that Vela�s shareholders will own 37% of Pharmos, and if Pharmos issues new shares on the basis of achieving certain milestones, Vela�s shareholders will own over half of Pharmos - i.e. they will gain control.  Miller and his associates claim, �Not only has Pharmos�s board saved Vela from severe financial distress, but by doing so it jeopardizes your investment in the company. We�re fed up standing aside and watching the share price fall under the leadership of the current board. It�s time for change; just look at the share graph (which is appended). This deal needlessly dilutes current shareholders, and the acquisition of Vela has a devastating impact on Pharmos� current shareholders.� Unfortunately for Aviv, he and Mony Ben-Dor and Dr. Abraham Sartani were supposed to be reelected to Pharmos�s board at the next general shareholders meeting. However, Miller wants these three seats for himself and his two associates. They promise to cut Pharmos�s cash burn rate, sign cooperation agreements with other companies, and increase value for shareholders. Miller, 52, is an investment advisor, who has been a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (NYSE:CME) and its stock market. He is currently a director on the boards of several companies, none of which, as far as I can see, is a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. McKee, 59, the second member of Miller�s trio, was appointed Pharmos VP business development in 2000, and was VP investor relations and business development between 2004 and March 2006, when he was fired. He previously served as VP at Collguard Biopharmaceuticals Ltd. Soula, 61, the third member of Miller�s trio, was a co-founder of Flamel Technologies SA (Nasdaq:FLML), a drug development company that specializes in polymer chemistry, and which was the second French company to be listed on Nasdaq. The company has a market cap of $455 million Miller and his associates estimate that they have spent $320,000 in their proxy fight at Pharmos, and are prepared to spend another $155,000. They say they intend for the company to repay these expenses.  �Miller has a fixation� What does Aviv have to say? On Saturday night, he sounded hurt and taken aback. �Miller said he wouldn�t do anything, and suddenly he has filed documents with the SEC. Although I don�t know the third partner, Soula, it�s clear to me that if this group includes McKee, whom I know very well, they�re not seeking a takeover. Miller, as far as we�re aware, has no management experience, and certainly not in the life sciences. His game is to buy shares whose market price is less than their cash value, but there�s a difference between a technology and a company of our kind. The deal with Vela is excellent, but we�re seeing him throw mud in all directions, and his claims are superficial. We�re still studying the material, and I already feel that now I�ve said too much, but it�s clear to us that Pharmos has something to offer its shareholders, much more than Miller can offer to win support.�  �Globes�: Miller claims that you�re giving away control of Pharmos. Aviv: We�ve taken great care not to surrender control. First of all, we appoint three of Pharmos�s nine directors, and we�re giving about a third of shares over 18 months. As for the additional 8 million shares, I�d be pleased to give them to the shareholders if they meet the milestones. Inshallah, we�ll get there, because then we�ll know that the drugs are successful. So what�s Miller talking about? I now have no other way to buy a drug, and in this case we�ve made a special blend of cash and shares. In our opinion, we�ve got an excellent asset here. What�s he worried about? That we�ll lose control? He says the shares are cheap, so shareholders� stakes will be diluted. At least on that I agree with him, the shares are cheap.  �We think that the deal with Vela is exceptional. I met analysts and investors, all of whom asked me how I closed this deal. I know first hand that Vela had a chance to get money from another source, but they preferred to go with us. They were impressed by what we have to offer, and by our professional management. Everyone feels that this is precisely what we were waiting for, and only Miller has this fixation that this is a bad deal.� As a practical matter, what will you do?   �I was never involved in such a proxy fight, so I�ll have to learn about it, but I am so sure that what we did was right that I�ll find the ways to get this message to the public. If investors think that this was a mistake and prefer Miller, and good luck to them. Please just note the group he�s formed, especially McKee, whom I�m certain wants to exact revenge on Pharmos. I don�t think that these are men from whom advice should be taken. Nonetheless, I�m not downplaying this story, but treating it seriously.� How did Miller become Pharmos�s largest shareholder, with you in second place?   �That�s one of the big problems. We don�t have enough investment institutions, which skews the distribution and gives Miller great weight.�  �They�ve unjustifiably jumped on us� Last week, �Globes� met Aviv to get an impression about developments at Pharmos, before he knew about the blow-up with Miller. Pharmos now rests on three legs. The first is in-house development of synthetic cannabinoid compounds. The most advanced product in this group is Cannabinor for the treatment of pain, which will begin Phase II clinical trials in a few weeks. Pharmos is also examining the development of synthetic cannabinoid compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune system failure.  �There are several kinds of pain,� says Aviv in explaining Cannabinor�s expected uniqueness. �One is acute pain, such as when you�re stabbed or in surgery. The second is neuropathic pain, which lasts for a long time. Another pain is inflammatory, which is linked to inflammations, and can be either acute or neuropathic. The pain market is large - half the population suffers from pain for which there is no relief. Some treatments have severe side effects, such as a sharp drop in blood pressure. In acute pain trials, we�ll test through an examination after wisdom tooth surgery. We�ll test 100 patients, although acute pain isn�t our direction. We�ll go in the direction of neuropathic pain, which we�ll begin studying on 30 healthy volunteers in a few weeks. We create pain by exposing them to capsaicin, found in chili peppers. In this way, we�ll examine Cannabinor�s treatment window.� Pharmos�s second leg is Vela, although its growth now seems more problematic. The third leg is in the direction of licensing of nanoemulsion, announced last year. Nanoemulsion is a nanotechnology mechanism of focused drug delivery using a special formula that Pharmos claims can deliver drugs directly to the desired tissue. Aviv says, �The risk levels here are lower than for drugs, and the time-to-market is shorter. For drugs, time-to-market is five to six years, where it�s three years for nanoemulsion, and at lower cost.� Pharmos has other technologies of this kind, such as a method of preventing drug delivery to the brain through chemical medication. �We now know we have to reduce Pharmos�s risk by diversification,� says Aviv. This is news to you? After all, it�s obvious you should reduce risk.   �It�s not new conceptually, but we didn�t have the means to this before, so it�s new in a practical manner. We knew this even before the failure of dexanabinol, we just couldn�t do it. We examined dozens of acquisition opportunities before reaching Vela through RBC, and its Israeli partner Tamir Fishman & Co., but most of the opportunities fell through. If the product was undergoing Phase I clinical trials, it was too undeveloped, and wouldn�t help us to know if the product had a chance. If it was undergoing Phase II, it wasn�t always enough.  �We met with a great many companies, including Israeli ones, which claimed they had good clinical data, but it wasn�t the case. We also examined companies in the Phase III stage, but their asking prices were astronomical. Vela had very good results for its trials on irritated bowel syndrome, which will have a $7.3 billion market in 2015. We naturally don�t expect such a volume, but it�s an indication.�   
        




What will your costs be if all goes according to plan?   �Phase IIb clinical trials will take us 24 months, and we�ll invest $12-15 million. Phase III clinical trials will take about the same amount of time, and will require $40 million. We plan that Phase II will be big enough to effectively serve as a kind of Phase III1 trial, but we haven�t yet settled this.� The market sees assets and company management at zero values.   �True, and I really don�t understand the market�s rationale. We were a disappointment, investors were burned, and talk badly about Pharmos, but more sophisticated investors are more positive. We hope to soon add value to the company from our new directions. The acquisition of Vela and progress in clinical trials for Cannabinor and in other areas will help investors realize this.� Dexanabinol damaged your reputation. Have you thought of quitting?  �We provided no guarantees, that�s certainly true, but the attack on us seems unjustified. We made a real professional and honest effort, and I was hurt by the attack on me. But I�m strong enough to withstand it. After all, it would have been the easiest thing for me to say, �I tried, it failed, good-bye.� How many more drugs will I be able to develop in my lifetime? Quite a few of my colleagues in the US told me, �What do you need this for? Sell your business, get some money, and leave.� I could make a living, I believe, even without this. But I insisted that that Pharmos�s amazing abilities would move on to the next generations. I still hope that we�ll do this, and build an international company. I don�t want to say how long it will take, but you see, I haven�t retreated into my shell. In any case, I�m sure that I wouldn�t change my career even if I were 30 years younger.� Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes.co.il - on May 29, 2006� Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2006

Lamassu Holdings blasts DITC board

					Posted in Activist Investors, Ditech Networks Inc (NASDAQ:DITC), Greenbackd Portfolio, Lamassu Holdings LLC, Lloyd I. Miller III, Net Cash Stocks, Stocks, tagged Activist investment, Ditech Networks Inc (NASDAQ:DITC), Lamassu Holdings LLC, Liquidation Value, Lloyd Miller, Net Cash Stock on July 17, 2009|

Lamassu Holdings has blasted the board of Ditech Networks Inc (NASDAQ:DITC). In a letter to the board, Lamassu Holdngs accuses DITC management of “spending as though Ditech Networks has money to burn, adding to the amount of money you have already lost for shareholders during your tenure,” “aggressively [overstepping] the bounds of good corporate governance” and “clearly [violating] your fiduciary responsibility.”
We’ve been following DITC (see our archive here) because it is trading below its net cash value with an investor, Lamassu Holdings LLC, disclosing a 9.4% holding in November last year. Lamassu has previously offered to acquire DITC for $1.25 per share in cash. Lamassu says that it “anticipates its due diligence requirement will take no more than two weeks and there is no financing contingency.” Lamassu has now nominated two candidates for election to the board “who are committed to enhancing shareholder value through a review of the Company’s business and strategic direction.” Lloyd I Miller III has also disclosed a 5.9% holding and has come out in support of Mr. Leehealey and Mr. Sansone – the director candidates nominated by Lamassu Holdings for election to the board of directors at the DITC annual meeting – as “candidates who are independent of management and he seeks to encourage greater attention to corporate governance by all members of the Board of Directors.” The stock is up 44.9% from our initial $0.89 to close yesterday at $1.29, giving the company a market capitalization of $33.9M. We last estimated the net cash value at around $32.2M or $1.23 per share and the liquidation value at around $43.4M or $1.65 per share. While the deterioration in value is a concern, Mr. Miller’s support of Lamassu Holding’s director candidates introduces a new element to the position. We’re inclined to hold on to see how the annual meeting plays out.
The press release setting out the text of the letter from Lamassu Holdings is set out below (via Yahoo Finance):
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Lamassu Holdings, LLC (“Lamassu”) has sent the following letter to the Board of Directors of Ditech Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:DITC – News) (“Ditech Networks”) Members of the Board:
Over the past month a significant number of shareholders have either publicly, through filings, or privately rejected your leadership by expressing their support for Lamassu’s director nominees. Instead of listening to these shareholders and correcting your course, you push forward spending as though Ditech Networks has money to burn, adding to the amount of money you have already lost for shareholders during your tenure. Your recent decision to tie executive compensation to a level of investment associated with mStage/toktok, an unproven technology that to date has produced no revenues and has no immediate prospects, is outrageous and limits management’s ability to make the hard but intelligent decisions to reduce investment in that technology if its prospects for revenue continue to be elusive. With this measure we believe you have aggressively overstepped the bounds of good corporate governance and have clearly violated your fiduciary responsibility.
Investors in Ditech Networks (NASDAQ: DITC – News) are not venture capitalists and did not sign up for this type of speculative investing with such a large portion of the Company’s assets. Management needs to have the latitude to make the decisions that are appropriate given the revenue prospects of each product and the Board should ensure that no individual investment puts the Company in as much jeopardy of total failure as the mStage/toktok investment does.
In addition, given the level of support for Lamassu’s slate of director nominees, we remain completely perplexed by your apparent desire to engage in a pointless proxy fight and waste Company resources to protect your own interests. It is obvious shareholders will aggressively reject the idea of spending millions of dollars of their money in this manner when the addition of Lamassu’s nominees to the Board will clearly provide a much needed new perspective that is not steeped in the countless mistakes of the past or married to visions and dreams that produce little or nothing in the way of actual revenue.
For the sake of all investors we encourage you to radically alter your behavior and begin listening to shareholders as opposed to pursuing your own interests and extremely risky agendas. While you personally will not be significantly harmed if mStage/toktok is unsuccessful and Ditech Networks ultimately fails, many investors are not in a position to so casually lose their money.
Sincerely Lamassu Holdings, LLC
Hat tip to Toby.

INFS releases results; burns cash and investment thesis

					Posted in Activist Investors, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd I. Miller III, Nery Capital Partners, Stocks, tagged Activist investment, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Liquidating Value, Nery Capital Partners on February 12, 2009|
													2 Comments » 


InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS) has released its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31 and they are, frankly, nothing short of horrific. As always, Greenbackd’s concern is primarily for the state of the balance sheet and the liquidation value of the company. Here, the news is bad:
Balance Sheet
Total cash and restricted cash as of December 31, 2008 were $33.4 million, a decrease of $36.9 million from the end of the third quarter. The reduction in cash was primarily driven by changes in working capital, the cash loss from operations and settlement on foreign exchange hedges. Inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were $38.5 million, an increase of $8.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2008.
We generally don’t pay too much mind to earnings. We welcome it when earnings fall off a cliff and drag stock along for the ride because it creates opportunities for investors like us who are focused on the balance sheet. We do, however, take issue with a management burning through more than half of a company’s cash in quarter, especially when that cash is set alight in the “settlement on foreign exchange hedges.” An investor cannot have any confidence in a management that, confronted with cash losses from operations, not only neglects to fix operating cash flow but finds a new way to lose money. Remember INFS’s adoption of a poison pill “to help ensure … our Board of Directors is able to conduct its review of strategic alternatives without the threat of coercive takeover or control tactics that do not offer shareholders a fair premium”? Surely that argument is at an end now. Management has failed. It’s time for Nery Capital Partners to bayonet the wounded and put INFS’s stockholders out of their misery.
When we started coverage in December last year, INFS had a market capitalization of $25.6M. We estimated its liquidating value to be more than 80% higher at $46.7M or $1.15 per share. With Nery Capital Partners and Miller pushing the company to enhance its stock price, we believed INFS to be an attractive opportunity. That seems to have been a mistake. We don’t have a full 10Q / 10K to review, so we’ve adjusted our earlier model based on the information in the press release attached to the 8K (described above). Based on that incomplete information, we estimate that INFS’s liquidation value could now be as low as $8M or $0.20 per share. Given that INFS closed yesterday at $0.37, our reason for holding the stock is gone. Accordingly, we have to close out the position. We opened it at $0.63, so our INFS position is down 41.3% on an absolute basis. The S&P 500 Index closed at 873.59 on December 12, 2008 and closed yesterday at 833.74. That’s a return of -4.6% for the index and means we’re off 36.7% on a relative basis. In all, a bitterly disappointing outcome.
If you have the stomach for it, you can read a summary of the whole sorry tale below. Looking back, it seems that there were a number of portentous steps taken by management that should have tipped us off:
After we opened our position on December 12 last year, INFS announced that it would “restructure.” We wrote that management “believes it will achieve profitable operations with an 18% gross margin target and operating expenses in the range of $10-11 million per quarter.” We noted that projections about future profitability often don’t turn out as projected, saying:
They are made by managements deaf to what the market is telling them about the company. As a result, we are much more interested in the company’s plans to unlock the value in the assets. On that front, the news is mixed.
INFS has previously announced that it had retained an investment banking firm to provide “advisory services.” The new announcement says that these advisory services include “advice concerning unsolicited offers from outside sources expressing interest in purchasing the Company.” This is a positive development. The bad news is that the company has suspended the stock repurchase plan, which is slightly disappointing. We say “slightly disappointing” because a buy back of 4 million shares over a three year period does not have a meaningful effect on the per share value, so cutting it makes almost no difference. It does show, however, that management is ignoring obvious value-enhancing opportunities for stockholders.
There was a brief glimpse of light when we read a report that a group of “high-powered executives,” including INFS’s co-founder Steve Hix, wanted to buy the company if they could get financing. The executives planned to save INFS from the “New York sharks” who wanted to liquidate the company for a quick profit. Said one of the group:
We’ve got some whispers that there’s a guy in New York looking at buying 50 percent of this company, and he’ll liquidate it. We are scared. We don’t want that to happen to this company. We’ve been working for nine months on a way to save it.
Nery Capital, presumably one of the “New York Sharks,” then upped its stake to 12.2% of INFS’s outstanding stock. It seemed we might be in a competitive bid situation, which would have been very good news for stockholders as it often presages a fully valued offer for the company.
Unfortunately, the news then took a decided turn for the worse when INFS’s management adopted a poison pill, which it euphemistically described as a “Shareholder Rights Plan.” We wrote that calling such an abomination a “Shareholder Rights Plan” was pretty galling when its effect was to take rights away from shareholders and deliver them to management. We were also unhappy with the suggestion that the board were the ones to determine what was “in the best interest of [INFS] and its shareholders” and how much of a premium was “fair” given the level at which the stock languished (when we wrote that, the stock “languished” at $0.78, more than 100% higher than the level at which it languishes today).
Tuesday’s results announcement is just the final nail in the coffin. We care little for the tumble in earnings. We do care that the company has burnt through more than half its cash in a single quarter in pursuit of “foreign exchange hedges.” We’ve lost what little confidence we had in management’s ability to put shareholders first. That wouldn’t ordinarily cause us to exit a position. The accelerating destruction of value is, however, too much, and we’ve closed out the position.

Nery Capital ups stake in INFS

					Posted in Activist Investors, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd I. Miller III, Nery Capital Partners, Stocks, tagged Activist investment, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Liquidating Value, Lloyd Miller, Nery Capital Partners on January 7, 2009|
													2 Comments » 


Nery Capital has increased its holding in InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS) according to its most recent 13D amendment filed January 5 this year.  Nery Capital now controls 12.2% of INFS’s outstanding stock, up from 11.2% at its last filing on December 5, 2008.
We’ve been following INFS because it is a deeply undervalued asset situation with two activist investors, Nery Capital and Lloyd I. Miller, III, pushing the company to “improve [INFS]’s financial condition and increase shareholder value” (see our first post here). A second potential bidding group, including INFS’s founder Steve Hix, emerged last year to fend off the “New York sharks,” and we think that is a positive development for stockholders (see our last post here).
INFS is up 28.6% to $0.81 since we started following it, but we see the liquidating value 42% higher at $1.15 per share, so we will continue to hold it.

INFS fending off “New York sharks”

					Posted in InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd I. Miller III, Nery Capital Partners, tagged InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd Miller, Nery Capital Partners on December 22, 2008|

According to the Portland Business Journal, a group of “high-powered executives” plan to save InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS) from “New York sharks” who want to liquidate the company for a quick profit. The group, which includes Steve Hix, INFS’s co-founder, wants to buy the company if they can get financing. The group says its strategy, which entails expanding beyond projectors, could save the company. Said one of the group:
We’ve got some whispers that there’s a guy in New York looking at buying 50 percent of this company, and he’ll liquidate it. We are scared. We don’t want that to happen to this company. We’ve been working for nine months on a way to save it.
We’ve been following INFS recently (see earlier posts here, here, here and here) writing that it is a deeply undervalued asset situation with two activist investors, Nery Capital Partners and Lloyd I. Miller, III, pushing the company to “consider the views expressed by its shareholders and pursue new alternatives to increase shareholder value.” We see a second bidding group as a positive catalyst.

INFS conference call discusses auction progress

					Posted in Activist Investors, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd I. Miller III, Nery Capital Partners, Stocks, tagged Activist investment, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd Miller, Nery Capital Partners on December 17, 2008|

InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS) held a conference call yesterday to discuss the progress of its auction. We’ve previously posted about INFS here, here and here, writing that it is a deeply undervalued asset situation with two activist investors, Nery Capital Partners and Lloyd I. Miller, III, pushing the company to “consider the views expressed by its shareholders and pursue new alternatives to increase shareholder value.”
The call is pretty tightly scripted and doesn’t shed much additional light on the auction progress (the archive of the earnings webcast is available here) (registration required). CEO Bob O’Malley, the speaker, says that INFS has retained Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment bank, to provide advisory services including advice concerning unsolicited offers from outside sources. O’Malley attributes the interest in purchasing the company to INFS’s “good brands, good projectors, market share, channels, strong and dedicated team etc.” He continued that the special committee will work with the investment bank to review the offers “so management can continue running the company.” The “structure and nature of the offers vary” so the review will take an “undeterminate” (sic) amount of time. INFS will provide updates when they reach “definitative offer” and “completed agreement” stages or “the board has terminated the process.” O’Malley reitereated that INFS has “put on hold” the buy back. Other than that, there was little else to report. O’Malley refused to take questions, so no commentary from Nery Capital Partners or Lloyd I. Miller, III, which was a little disappointing.

InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS) Restructuring

					Posted in Activist Investors, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd I. Miller III, Nery Capital Partners, Stocks, tagged Activist investment, Add new tag, InFocus Corporation (NASDAQ:INFS), Lloyd Miller, Nery Capital Partners on December 15, 2008|

We’ve recently posted about INFS’s value proposition here (it’s deeply undervalued) and the effect of a big buy back on the per share value of the company  here (it’s hugely positive).
The company today announced plans to restructure and reduce its global workforce by approximately 30%, commencing in January 2009 and spanning a twelve month period. The announcement also says that that INFS “believes it will achieve profitable operations with an 18% gross margin target and operating expenses in the range of $10-11 million per quarter.” While this may appear to be encouraging for stockholders, in our experience projections about future profitability often don’t turn out as projected. They are made by managements deaf to what the market is telling them about the company. As a result, we are much more interested in the company’s plans to unlock the value in the assets. On that front, the news is mixed.
INFS has previously announced that it had retained an investment banking firm to provide “advisory services.” The new announcement says that these advisory services include “advice concerning unsolicited offers        from outside sources expressing interest in purchasing the Company.” This is a positive development.

We say “slightly disappointing” because a buy back of 4 million shares over a three year period does not have a meaningful effect on the per share value, so cutting it makes almost no difference. It does show, however, that management is ignoring obvious value-enhancing opportunities for stockholders.
INFS will host a conference call to discuss the announcement tomorrow, December 16, 2008 at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern). No doubt Nery Capital Partners and Lloyd I. Miller, III will be on.

Long-Term Major Shareholder Lloyd I. Miller III Announces Intention to Vote FOR JPS Industries, Inc. Slate at Annual Meeting

Feb 03, 2015, 06:00 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Lloyd I. Miller III 











 
















































 

 




















 


WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lloyd I. Miller III, today announced his intention to vote in favor of the Company's slate for election at the Annual Meeting of JPS Industries, Inc. (OTC PINK: JPST) ("JPS" or the "Company") to be held on February 19, 2015.  Mr. Miller strongly supports the Company's slate and management for the reasons described below.
DISSIDENTS HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  Mr. Miller notes that the dissident slate of nominees has been hand picked by Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) ("Steel Partners"), a large stockholder whose affiliate recently attempted to buy JPS at an initial price of $7.00, which was later revised to $8.00 to $10.00 per share, subject to deductions, according to the Company's proxy statement.  Based on the Company's valuation estimate of $13.00 per share, as described in their proxy statement, Mr. Miller does not believe that the offer of $10.00 per share by the affiliate of Steel Partners is in any way adequate, setting aside all questions of whether or not their offer would in fact result in a transaction at that price.  
RISK OF PREMATURE SALE.  Mr. Miller has been an investor in JPS since 1997.  As a long-term investor, he is open to all strategic alternatives that contribute to shareholder value, including a possible sale of the Company on favorable terms.  He is opposed to a premature sale of the Company at an inadequate price.  Mr. Miller is disappointed in the process that Steel Partners has pursued to date in seeking to purchase the Company for $10.00 per share, markedly less than the Company's valuation estimate of $13.00 per share, a gap of approximately 23%.  On that basis, if an affiliate of Steel Partners later renews its bid for the Company, Mr. Miller believes that the election of Steel's dissident nominees to control the JPS Board would not yield an optimal price for all shareholders.
EXCELLENT MANAGEMENT.  In particular, Mr. Miller is voting in favor of the Company's slate to demonstrate his strong support for the CEO, Mr. Mikel H. Williams, who is on the Company's slate, for his excellent management.  Mr. Miller commends Mr. Williams for paying down company debt and pension obligations to the tune of $72 million, which he views as a remarkable achievement.  
CEO PROVEN TRACK RECORD.  Mr. Miller notes that CEO Mikel Williams has a track record in the industry of realizing value for shareholders.  Specifically, as a large shareholder of DDi Corp. (DDIC) in 2009 when Mr. Williams was CEO, Mr. Miller saw first-hand that Mr. Williams not only excelled at running an industrial business similar to JPS, but also negotiated the sale of DDi at a premium price.  With his outstanding skills and experience as CEO and a director, Mr. Williams is well positioned to pursue value for JPS shareholders.
