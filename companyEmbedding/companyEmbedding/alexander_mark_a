Mark fits so well into the culture because he's great at managing change with enthusiasm, creativity and in a rational way. Mark has shown himself to be a leader with vision who can crystallize strategy and coalesce his team into action. His ability to build consensus and foster meaningful change makes him an indispensable member of the Rue team. Our early work developing and designing mobile apps together was my first glimpse into is passion for the customer experience and his ability to synthesize requirements into solutions. He does it with a good dose of humor and enthusiasm. With all the change at Rue, Mark's commitment is one constant.See moreSee lessFew people have the opportunity to report into a manager who is also a coach and mentor—but I did when I worked for Mark last year at Rue La La. Mark was committed to helping me find success in my career by empowering me to develop my own strengths, and by providing me with the direction, confidence and motivation to make it all happen. Mark is still supportive and a strong advocate for my continued growth, dropping by my desk often to check in, giving me guidance when needed, and going far beyond what a typical manager would do, even though his official managerial responsibilities ended months ago. Mark has also regularly impressed me with his ability to communicate to colleagues and employees in all levels of the organization. His approachable, positive attitude, and extreme enthusiasm for his work has earned him a very positive reputation and he is held in high regard. Mark certainly leads by example and he’s given me much to look up to. What I really appreciate about Mark is his sense of humor and undying optimism. No matter how tense a meeting, Mark makes sure everyone leaves with a smile. Mark is a true role model for me and as a team manager or a leader, Mark earns my highest recommendation.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended MarkGroupsINSEAD SF Bay Area Product ManagersINSEAD AlumniRetail Industry Professionals GroupCommonwealth CrossFit: Work hard, work hardalumni UBC (University of British Columbia)INSEAD Americas ForumThe Accidental Product ManagerView Mark’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Mark directlyView Mark’s Full ProfileNot the Mark you’re looking for?

About Mark

Mark Alexander's practice is diverse, focusing on products liability and casualty litigation, business litigation, workers' compensation defense, governmental agencies such as school districts and economic development entities, construction law, eminent domain, and other real estate issues and creditor's rights, including loan workouts, foreclosure actions and collections. Mark has prosecuted and defended clients before all state and federal courts in the States of Mississippi and Alabama. Mark has tried many jury trials in his professional career; however, his goal is to immerse himself in his client's business and solve their legal needs short of litigation, if at all possible.




Q&A
Expand All
Collapse All



What types of clients do you represent?
I, along with several of my partners in our Gulfport office, represent the largest investor owned electric utility in South Mississippi.  I also represent general contractors and subcontractors throughout Mississippi.  Additionally, I advise two very successful school districts in South Mississippi and multiple banks with operations throughout the state and the Southeast.


How are you involved in your community?
I am a member of Trinity United Methodist Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, and have served Trinity as vice-chairman of its Board of Trustees.  I am also a member of the Board of Directors for the Make-a-Wish Foundation of South Mississippi. I also serve on the Board of Directors for the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce and the Boy's & Girls Club - Forrest Heights Center.


What previous experiences, prior to your work at Balch, influence your practice?
Prior to attending law school, I was an account executive for an advertising agency.  This experience gave me an appreciation for the business side of clients and what legal advice is necessary to make their business safe and profitable.


Which Courts or agencies do you most often appear before on behalf of your clients? 
I most often appear before all state courts in the State of Mississippi.  I have handled litigation matters before Circuit, County and Chancery Courts all across the state.  In addition, I have tried and argued controverted matters before Administrative Judges and Commissioners of the Mississippi Workers' Compensation Commission.

Contractor Dispute:  Mark was first chair for jury trial involving claims against a subcontract, general contractor and owner.  After six days of trial, the sub-subcontractor's lien claims against the owner and general contractor were dismissed and not submitted to the jury.  Despite arguments for a verdict in excess of $1 million, the jury awarded the sub-subcontractor the balance of its contract value from the subcontractor and a nominal award against the general contractor for extra-contractual work requested by the general contractor.  (2014)
Scope of Education Contract:  Mark's client was awarded summary judgment finding that a basketball coach's coaching duties were separate and distinct from its teaching contract.  This ruling was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  (2006)
Electric Contact Case:  Mark successfully settled a lawsuit for an electric utility provider alleging negligence on the part of the provider, which led to contact with live utility lines.  The settlement was for approximately 33% of the damages alleged by the plaintiff.  (2011)
 Motor Vehicle Accident:  Mark was part of a trial team that obtained a $0 defense verdict in Jones County Circuit Court following a week-long jury trial concerning damages from a motor vehicle accident. On his recommendation, Mark's client had admitted fault for the accident prior to trial; therefore, the sole issue at trial was the amount of damages caused by the accident, if any.  (2012)
