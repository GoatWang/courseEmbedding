Square Inc.: Commoditized And Overpriced Product, Overloved And Overvalued Stock - Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Square Inc.: Commoditized And Overpriced Product, Overloved And Overvalued StockMar.31.17 | About: Square, Inc. (SQ) Moon Walker Long/short equity, short only, contrarianSummarySquare – a mobile payment service provider, that also offers financial and marketing services – is severely overvalued.With a market capitalization of $6.1 billion, the market is pricing in high margin revenue growth over an extended period.Sell side analysts are largely bullish on this company with a “greenfield” growth opportunity.We believe Square is likely to underwhelm investors – in a significant way – on both the revenue and margin front over the coming years.We estimate a fair value of Square’s stock at $2.1 per share, which is roughly 90% below current market levels of $17.4.Full report available here Square (NYSE:SQ) is a Payment Service Provider. At its core, Square provides a service that allows micro-merchants with low volumes of debit and credit card sales to obtain the benefits only a separate merchant account could otherwise have provided. Square provides hardware and software to merchants that enable them to accept debit and credit card payments. The card readers and stands attach to smartphones and tablets, providing a business with a point of sale solution. We estimate a fair value of Square's stock at $2.1 per share, which is roughly 90% below current market levels of $17.4. 

 We believe Square is likely to underwhelm investors - in a significant way - on both the revenue and margin front over the coming years for the following reasons: 1. Square's customer base of financially disadvantaged and fickle micro-merchants is fundamentally unattractive: While most merchant acquirers seek financially strong and commercially thriving customers, Square targets exactly the opposite; desperate micro-merchants looking for a quick and easy payment processing solution with low up-front cost. Square attempts to onboard as many of these financially disadvantaged micro-merchants as possible to its overpriced payment processing platform - with free or highly subsidized debit and credit card readers - in the hope that a few successful micro-merchants will justify the acquisition costs of the millions of unsuccessful others. This strategy has worked to-date due to a first mover-advantage in micro-merchant payment processing and a conducive economic environment. Square's anomalously high transaction margins of over 1% and its string of surprisingly strong results over the last five quarters can be explained by these dual tailwinds.

Square needs a constant influx of new micro-merchants to replenish its existing cohort of older micro-merchants, close to 70% of whom are at risk of leaving the platform at some point during their respectively business lifecycles. 

 The underlying dynamics of Square's business are ugly, characterized by an expensive mobile payment processing solution, a customer base with median card sales of just over $400 a month, high levels of merchant and GPV attrition - reaching 40% and 20% in a normal year, respectively - and potential recessionary merchant and GPV attrition rates, exceeding 50% and 40%, respectively. This dynamic will significantly dampen Square's Return on Invested Capital, compared to other payment service providers, such as PayPal and Heartland Payment Systems, who cater to a higher quality customer base. 


 2. Analysts comparing Square to PayPal or First Data are comparing "apples and oranges"; Square has more in common with Fitbit and GoPro: As a micro-merchant aggregator, Square's overpriced and commoditized product caters to a sub-prime customer base, has high transaction expenses, no moat, no network effects, no vertical integration, suffers from extreme competition and has almost zero switching costs. This contrasts with PayPal's payment processing platform that caters to a prime customer base, has a monopolistic presence as the internet's preeminent online wallet, a funding mix that frequently results in 100% margin transactions and high switching costs due to network effects developed from engaging both buyers and sellers.

 Square has more in common with Fitbit and GoPro - pioneers in the connected fitness and action camera markets, respectively - that severely undershot lofty analyst projections because of the effects of brutal price competition in a commoditized low-barriers-to-entry business. 

 3. Extreme competition from ISOs/MSRs and traditional merchant acquirers will limit Square's growth and margins: A look at the micro-merchant mobile payment service provider landscape shows a bewildering number of Square competitors offering cheaper "no-frills" alternatives or similar polished products. Notable "no-frills" competitor Electronic Merchant Systems offers "EMS+", a service with a flat all-inclusive rate of 2.25% per swipe - compared to Square's 2.75% - and a free card reader. 

Products with similar, and sometimes superior pricing, hardware and software to Square, include "Spark Pay" by Capital One, "QuickBooks GoPayment" by Intuit, "PayPal Here" by PayPal, "Clover" by First Data, and Pay Anywhere. 

 Traditional merchant account providers, which includes many Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) and Member Service Providers (MSRs), now also offer mobile processing rates that make Square's rates look very high. First Data's Clover has been gaining market share with over 500,000 devices shipped and 16% market share amongst its SMB clients - establishing a strong presence in a Square target market.
 

 There are also several new entrants. Chase Paymentech will soon be releasing a micro-merchant mobile payment processing solution with flat rates lower than Square's. Shopify has recently introduced a suite of POS products competing for micro- and small businesses. Verifone will soon be launching "Carbon", a payment terminal with a POS platform in a single device. And Poynt 5 and Poynt Smart Terminal are new open-architecture POS competitors to Square. 

 4. Square is over-earning; Gross margins will come down due to lower take-rates and stubbornly high transaction costs: Square's outsized gross margins are likely to come down substantially over time as it experiences pressure on take-rates from extreme competition and its efforts to move upmarket to merchants with higher GPV, all the while experiencing stubbornly high transaction costs, particularly high interchange and assessment fees. Analysts are extremely sanguine on these key drivers of Square's profitability - forecasting stability far into the future - despite several warning signs. PayPal's decline in take-rates and transaction margins over the last few years provides us with empirical evidence and a historical precedent, while Heartland's transaction profit margin a full fifty percent below Square's show us the real-world challenges of merchant acquirers moving up-market.

In the card processing food chain, card networks - like Visa and MasterCard - call the shots. Square does not have the influence to maintain its high pricing structure or retain its successful clients. 

 5. Square has a limited Target Addressable Market in the U.S. and internationally: Square's over-bullish management team has misled the analyst community on the potential size of their TAM in the U.S., by repeatedly citing success with "large sellers" and U.S. card transaction volume of $10 trillion. The reality is that 99%+ of Square's customers, by number, are financially disadvantaged micro-merchants, with only a handful of SME customers. Square's prospects with large companies are extremely limited. For a business processing debit and credit card transactions with an average ticket size of $9 and monthly GPV greater than $7,700, leaving Square for a merchant account becomes economically preferable, due to special Visa/MasterCard small ticket rates. For businesses with higher average ticket sizes, the volume threshold is significantly lower due to the cap on debit card rates imposed by the Durbin Amendment. For example, for a merchant with an average ticket size of $30, the monthly GPV threshold to leave Square for a merchant account falls to $4,400.
 

 

 Square's business model does not work as well in other developed markets, such as the U.K., Europe and Australia, and emerging markets, such as China and India. In the case of the U.K., Europe and Australia, consumer interchange fees are heavily regulated at very low flat rates between 0.2%-0.3%, so Square's all-inclusive flat payment processing fee is far less attractive to merchants. In the case of Emerging Markets, low levels of credit card penetration and prevalence of cash transactions for micropayments make Square's solutions significantly less attractive. In this respect, Square also faces regulatory risks that would potentially make its business model far less appealing for micro-merchants in the U.S. and Canada. A cap on credit card interchange fees, like debit card "swipe" fees implemented by the Durbin Amendment, could be potentially devastating to Square, yet is not a possibility being considered by analysts. 

 Square is also on the wrong side of a powerful technological megatrend towards digital payments and its hardware gateways risk obsolescence from larger innovative digitally focused payment solution providers, such as Apple, Google and PayPal, and even new tokenization technology such as that used by Apple Pay and Cartwheel Point of Sale. In fact, countries like China are leap-frogging debit and credit cards to move straight to online payment solutions like Alipay, WeChat Payment and Baidu Wallet.
 6. Analysts are overestimating growth of Square Capital, which will likely experience a fate similar to other non-bank lenders, like OnDeck Capital: Square's core payment processing business lacks operating leverage, so - to justify lofty price targets - analysts are modeling rapid revenue and margin growth from upselling of Square's "value added services" - particularly Square Capital. Square Capital is an unattractive source of funding for all but the most desperate and financially disadvantaged micro-merchants given APRs in the region of 16%-28%. In addition to larger merchants, Square Capital also presents an economically inferior solution for successful micro-merchants compared to alternatives. SBA working capital loans - targeted at profitable and growing micro-merchants - have APRs a full 6% to 18% lower than Square Capital. 

 Square Capital is an attempt by management to stem the effects of GPV attrition due to successful micro-merchants leaving Square's overpriced payment processing platform for a more competitive solution. The decline of other non-bank online loan providers also reliant on fickle third-party funding sources, like OnDeck Capital, should serve as a cautionary tale for Square Capital. 

 


 7. Micro-merchants have neither the business need nor financial wherewithal to afford Square's "me-too" software products: Square's other "value added services" consist of "me-too" software solutions, such as Square Payroll and Invoice (à la Quickbooks), Employee Management (à la Zenefits), Cash (à la Venmo), Online Store (à la Shopify) and Appointments (à la Google Calendar). The median Square customer is a financially disadvantaged micro-merchant with approximately $400 of card sales that has neither the business need nor the financial wherewithal to purchase complex accounting, employee management, email marketing, and loyalty software. Given sales of Square's software are tied to the number of customers subscribing to it, not GPV volume, it is highly likely that software sales will undershoot analyst forecasts. Another indicator of the low demand Square's ancillary software is likely to generate is the lack of any mention of "ecosystem" by experts when comparing payment service providers. Exhibit 21: Square's software products are expensive for the median Square micro-merchant with $5000 of annual card sales   Square software Annual cost         Payroll subscription $25 + $5 x 3 employees x 12 = $480   Employee Management subscription $5 x 3 employees x 12 = $180   Appointments subscription $50 per month X 12 = $600   Email Marketing subscription $15 per month X 12 = $180   Loyalty subscription $25 per month X 12 = $300   Gift cards purchase $40 per pack X 2 = $80         Total $1,820   Source: www.squareup.com, Author calculations 8. Unattractive industry economics and poor capital allocation decisions will detract from shareholder returns: Extreme competition and the fast pace of innovation in mobile hardware and software payment providers has led to unattractive industry economics with a need for extremely high R&D. In the twelve months ending September 30, 2016, Square devoted a full $263 million to product development, or 42% of adjusted revenues of $630 million. Given the lack of traction Square's "me-too" software products are likely to have with micro-merchants, we believe the return on this R&D will be poor.
 

 Operating in a commoditized yet fast faced industry has led to high levels of capital expenditures (CAPEX), in the form of regular acquisition spending. For example, to get in-house access to the latest NFC/EMV technology for payment cards, in 2015 Square acquired Kili Technology- a fabless semiconductor company based in Canada. More recently, Square also bought a "software technology related to network connections" for an undisclosed amount. We believe such regular acquisitions, which highlight the elevated CAPEX needs of this business, will continue, negatively impacting shareholder returns. Before focusing more exclusively on the current growth opportunity in micro-merchant card processing, CEO Jack Dorsey spent significant shareholder resources developing a failed food delivery business, first organically through Square Order, then through three acquisitions - Caviar in 2014 for $90 million, Fastbite in 2015 and Main Line Delivery in 2016. The returns on these investments have so far been poor, as these businesses continue to lose money. A "misfit" food delivery business shows a history of poor capital allocation. CEO Jack Dorsey is stretched thin, as he is also currently the CEO of Twitter, a company desperately trying to turnaround operations. 

 Staying true to its Silicon Valley roots, Square is a prolific issuer of stock for acquisitions and to employees as compensation, thereby diluting existing and future shareholders - if the practice continues. Over the twelve months ended 12/31/2016, Square issued $138.8 million of Stock Based Compensation (SBC), primarily to its engineering, design, and product personnel in product development ($91.4 million). This comes to 20% of the Company's Adjusted Revenue of $687MM over the same period. Given what we believe to be Square's limited prospects for profitable growth, we believe this generous SBC will detract from shareholder value. Using a dilution adjusted Black-Scholes model, we calculate the negative impact value on equity of outstanding stock options at the current stock price to be approximately $963.5 million.
 Exhibit 24: Square's outstanding options are valued at almost $1 billion, based on a $17.43 stock price, and represent an overhang on the company's valuation   Current stock price $17.43   Options Outstanding 86.7 million   Average Strike Price $7.32   Average expiration term 7.4 years   Standard deviation of Square stock 43.5%   Risk free rate 2.4%   Value per option $11.37   Valuation of outstanding options based on dilution adjusted Black-Scholes $985.5 million   Source: Author calculations 9. The market is being too optimistic; Square's fair value is 80% below current levels: By valuing Square at $6.1 billion today, the market is implying a business that will grow revenues at close to 26% over the next ten years to over $7 billion, generate over $1.4 billion in operating income at margins close to 20% a year and generate ROICs close to 20% a year. This outcome is highly unlikely in our opinion given the realities of Square's customer base and business model. Exhibit 25: Square - Combining reverse DCF with a customer dynamics model shows the market's implied steady state customer and revenue figures   Key metric Market implied steady state         # of customers 19.3 million   Percentage of micro-merchant market 70%   GPV $531 billion   % GPV > $500,000 14.7%   Transaction margin 1.04%         Square Capital origination volume $9.1 billion   Square Capital "gain-on-sale" + interest revenues* $548 million   Software subscription revenues $269 million   Instant deposit revenues $48 million   Invoice revenues $48 million   Food delivery revenues $122 million         Subscription and services-based revenue $1,036 million         Square hardware revenue $402 million         Total revenues $7.0 billion   Operating income $1.4 billion   Operating margin 20%   Return on invested capital 20%   Terminal cost of capital 8%         Source: Author assumptions Under more realistic conditions, Square will likely see a sharp deceleration in revenue growth over time as the realities of its fickle and financially disadvantaged customer base become more apparent.
 Our estimate of Square's long-term market share of the micro-merchant card payment processing market is approximately 7 million merchants, with strong competition from PayPal Here, Clover, QuickBooks GoPayment, Spark Pay, and Shopify. 

   Company Percentage # of customers in millions   Square 25% 6.88   PayPal Here 15% 4.13   Clover 15% 4.13   QuickBooks GoPayment 10% 2.75   Spark Pay by Capital One 5% 1.38   Shopify 5% 1.38   Chase Paymentech 2.5% 0.69   Pay Anywhere 2.5% 0.69   Verifone Carbon 2.5% 0.69   Poynt 2.5% 0.69   Others* 15% 4.13   Total 100% 27.50   * Others include "no-frills" solutions like EMS+ and Cartwheel Point of Sale, ISOs/MSRs like Flagship ROAMpay, National Bankcard and CreditCard Processing.com. Author estimates. Exhibit 27: Projected Square revenues split between transaction, software and hardware revenues over the next 20 years 

 In a steady state, we believe Square will generate revenues of just over $2 billion, GAAP operating margins of 15%, Return on Invested Capital of 10%, with transaction margins close to 0.77% on a GPV of $171 billion. This compares to PayPal's revenues of $7.8 billion, GAAP operating margins of 20%, Return on Invested Capital of 9%, with transaction margins of 1.80% on a GPV of $354 billion.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.
Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]

Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]

In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010.

Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.
Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.
Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.
Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

Square, Inc.'s Best Product of 2016 | Market Tamer






























































































 

 






 


 





Square, Inc.'s Best Product of 2016
MarketTamer |  by EditorPosted on December 30, 2016 | Breaking News 


                	This post was originally published on this siteMost people only know Square (NYSE:SQ) for one or two products: its elegantly designed point-of-sale systems you can find in small coffee shops and boutiques and maybe its Square Cash peer-to-peer payments app. And while its payments business is growing well — gross payment volume is up 42% through the first nine months of 2016 — it’s one of the company’s other products that’s driven its recent top-line beats.
Square has been able to continue growing its Square Capital business, recently surpassing $1 billion in total originations since its introduction in 2014. Square Capital offers loans to merchants using Square’s payments terminal and business dashboard in exchange for an additional cut of sales from every swipe they make at the register. Last quarter, Square extended another $208 million in loans, up 10% sequentially and 70% year over year.
The big reason Square Capital is so important to Square
Square Capital is the biggest part of Square’s software and data products segment. The segment also includes its food-delivery business, Caviar, and smaller products like Instant Deposit and Payroll. While Square doesn’t separate out Square Capital’s financial results, the software and data products segment consistently produces a gross margin of around 65% compared to the 35% gross margin for Square’s payments business.
The segment still accounts for just 7% of revenue, but it overshoots its weight in operating income due to its superior margins. It’s also growing significantly faster than Square’s other operating segments. Through the first nine months of 2016, software and data products revenue increased 149%. Growth accelerated from the second quarter to the third from 130% to 140% despite strong sequential growth last year as well.
Not only does Square Capital have relatively high margins, but it also supports the company’s main business. The loans Square provides through Square Capital go directly toward growing the small businesses that use its payments systems. If the money is invested wisely, it should result in an increase in payments volume from the businesses as they grow.
So, Square benefits from a rapidly growing, higher-margin business in Square Capital while its main payments business gets a boost as well. That makes Square Capital its best product.
A strong contender for 2017
Last August, Square opened up Instant Deposit to all of its merchants. Instant Deposit, as the name implies, allows Square users to deposit funds from sales directly into their bank accounts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The funds post instantly.
Since launching the service, over 200,000 sellers have used it more than 4 million times. Additionally, it’s growing faster than other products in the high-margin software and data products segment, although Square wouldn’t provide any exact details.
As CFO Sarah Friar noted, “Instant Deposit is definitely a high-margin product,” implying that it has even higher margins than Square Capital or Caviar. “Instant Deposit is a real growth driver in that software and data line and becoming material to it” during the company’s third-quarter earnings call, she added.
To be sure, Instant Deposit is a small part of a small business segment for Square, but it’s a product that has the potential to produce meaningful operating income for Square considering its high margins. That makes it something to watch when Square reports its results next year.

Jack Dorsey: The Man Who Made the Cash Register Obsolete


With the Square Card Reader, Jack Dorsey made it possible for anyone, anywhere to take credit card payments. Now, competition is heating up in the mobile payments market.

BRING IT ON
Jack Dorsey anticipated early skepticism about Square and confronted it directly.
CREDIT: 









COMPANY PROFILE
Company: Square Headquarters: San Francisco Year Founded: 2009 Employees: 500 







It started with a list: "140 Reasons Why Square Will Fail."
In 2009, Jack Dorsey distributed the list, replete with counterpoints, to potential investors to prove that he knew exactly what his new start-up was up against, and more important, that he knew how to face it. Square's plan was to use technology to allow anyone, anywhere to take credit card payments. The list was a cheeky reference to Dorsey's last company, Twitter, and a clever nod to the naysayers who doubted that the guy who invented a microblogging service could take on the financial industry. "I didn't have a finance background, my co-founders didn't, and we didn't hire anyone who worked in finance until we reached 25 employees," Dorsey says. "We get to design what we want to see in the world rather than doing what other people think should be done."
The market buys in
One guiding philosophy at Square is that technology should be so intuitive that no one stops to question how difficult it must have been to create. That philosophy is paying off. In 2010, Square introduced the Card Reader, a 1-inch-square white dongle that plugs into a headset jack and, voilà, turns any iPhone, iPad, or Android phone or tablet into a credit card processor. Today, more than three million merchants are using the Card Reader to process $12 billion a year in transactions. The reader, which is free to order on the Square site, connects to Square Register, a souped-up point-of-sale app that replaces the traditional cash register, allowing customers to pay with cash or swipe a credit or debit card and sign on the screen with a finger. In 2011, Square launched a consumer-facing app, Square Wallet, that allows customers to walk into a store and pay by just saying their names. It's being used at more than 250,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada.
"The idea for Square came from a frustration, one that many small-business owners have struggled with." --James Dyson
Square charges merchants just 2.75 percent per swipe or, for merchants who swipe less than $250,000 a year, a flat fee of $275 per month. For small-business owners accustomed to hidden fees and rates that can run in the ballpark of 4 percent per swipe, this transparency is the cherry on top.
 
Despite Square's rapid growth, which recently earned the company a valuation of $3.25 billion, there's not a single salesperson among its 500 employees. "The product sells itself," Dorsey says. That fact was apparent at the Artists & Fleas pop-up craft fair in downtown Manhattan, which Dorsey visited one Friday afternoon in March. "It's fantastic!" a thoroughly tattooed, classic New York character named Tony Stinkmetal gushed. He and his friend Keith ("Golly") Bishop run Golly NYC, a company that sells custom superhero T-shirts, housewares, and clothes made of children's sheets and sleeping bags. Stinkmetal says he started using Square because his last credit card processor took several days to deposit money into his account. Square does it overnight. "Everyone who has a business right now is kind of scrambling," he says, "so those two days make a big difference." Mike Lindwasser, a photographer with a booth at the market, praised Square's analytics. Standing nearby as Lindwasser tells his story, Dorsey looks proud. This is why he started Square.
Creation myth
As the oft-told story goes, the idea for Square came about after Jim McKelvey, Dorsey's friend and former boss, who is a computer engineer and skilled glass blower, missed out on a $2,000 sale of one of his glass faucets. McKelvey, like millions of small-business owners in the country, couldn't accept his potential customer's credit card. So he, Dorsey, and an iOS engineer named Tristan O'Tierney developed what would eventually become Square to ensure this would never happen again. "I knew what it was like to be a small merchant and be excluded from commerce because I didn't have a credit card system," says McKelvey, who now sits on Square's board.
As it turned out, Dorsey, McKelvey, and O'Tierney's dream directly violated the major credit card companies' rules. At the time, they banned so-called payment aggregators, which allow people to accept credit cards without a merchant account. (The aggregator acts as the merchant.) The card companies had made an exception for PayPal, an online aggregator, but mobile aggregators were a different story. If Square was going to work, the card companies would have to rewrite their rule books. So Dorsey took a clunky but functional prototype to the major banks and credit card companies and gave them a demo. Within six months, they came around.
In many ways, Square is building the quintessential technology of a new generation. If the past decade was about the iPad, the iPhone, and other gadgets we hold in our hands, Square's success suggests the next decade will be about the technology we never see. Instead, we will merely accept, and come to expect, that it's working all around us. That's the future Dorsey imagines.
The product that edges closest to that future is Square Wallet. Dorsey challenged his engineers to build a product that would let him walk into a coffee shop, place an order, tell the barista his name, and walk away wondering if he even paid. Square Wallet does just that. Users open the app and choose a participating merchant. When they arrive, the merchant has a photo of them on Square Register. With the tap of a button, the merchant can charge the customer's account.
The competition wakes up
Square is the golden child of Silicon Valley. So far, it has raised more than $341 million in financing from VC firms, Starbucks, and other investors. But its success has also bred fierce competition. There are now thousands of players in the mobile payments market, according to Gartner analyst Sandy Shen, including the very credit card companies that once blocked aggregated transactions. Bank of America recently undercut Square's prices with its mobile card reader, which charges vendors 2.7 percent per swipe. And Visa signed a deal with Samsung to equip Samsung's next generation of phones with Visa's PayWave app. PayPal, Intuit, and Groupon are also on Square's ever-growing list of competitors.
For now, Square clearly has the first-mover advantage, especially with small businesses. And last year, it struck a deal with Starbucks to roll out Square Wallet in 7,000 Starbucks stores, which is raising awareness among mainstream consumers. "We're trying to keep our stress levels low and just do innovative things," says Dorsey.
Within the next 10 years, Dorsey expects Square to be available worldwide. That's a tall order, but few people could have predicted the huge success of Twitter when Dorsey co-founded that company in 2006. Two years later, he was publicly ousted as CEO. A year after that, he founded Square. "You fail and you get back up," he says. "That's part of doing anything that people find to be revolutionary or important. You'll have tons of people saying, 'No, you can't do this,' but you do it again, anyway, and you don't let them stop you."

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.
Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Hardware Products[edit]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California. The company markets several software and hardware payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader, and has expanded into small business services such as Square Capital, a financing program, Square Cash, a person-to-person payments service, and Square Payroll. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.
Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom, to accept offline debit[discuss] and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer. The application software ("app") supports manually entering the card details, swiping the card through the audio jack-connected Square Reader, or inserting or tapping the card using the Bluetooth LE-connected Square Chip and Contactless Reader. On the iPad version of the Square Register app, the interface resembles a traditional cash register.

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Square
Creation[edit]
The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (a St. Louis friend of Dorsey at the time) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[4]
The name "Square" refers to Square's card readers, which are square in shape. The name also refers to the idiomatic term for settling debts: "squaring up." Several other names for the company were considered, including squirrel, stash, and wallet. The name Squirrel was used during a meeting the company had with Apple's Scott Forstall, SVP of iPhone Software, wherein Dorsey saw that the Apple cafe's point-of-sale system was provided by a company called "Squirrel Systems," and decided to change the name.[5][6]
Products[edit]
Devices[edit]
Square Reader[edit]
The Square Reader was the first product released by Square, and is used to accept credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. Square's original reader consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5 mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analogue card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.[7] Square's technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant and Verisign certified.[8]
In April 2011, rival payment company Verifone claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure, and that a "reasonably-skilled" programmer could write a replacement app which could conceivably use the Square device to skim a credit card and return its details, because the first-generation Square Reader did not encrypt track data in hardware. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.[9] Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noted that the card data could be gathered visually from the card, and said that the claims ignored the fraud protection provided by card issuers.[10]
Square now uses strong encryption on its devices, including SSL and PGP.[8] Its cryptographic keys are at least 2048 bits in length.[8] Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.[8] Square follows the guidelines issued by OWASP.[8]
In July 2014, Square announced a card reader that would accept chip cards and contactless cards, ahead of the October 2015 EMV liability shift. This new reader supports chip-and-signature and contactless transactions, and the standard Square Reader is also provided in order to support traditional magnetic stripe card transactions.[11]
In June 2015 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced Square will release a new Square Reader capable of accepting Apple Pay and other contactless payments.[12] The reader will also be able to accept EMV chip cards.
Square Stand[edit]




Square Stand at a coffee shop turned around for the customer to choose a tipping option


In June 2013, Square unveiled Square Stand at a press event at Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco. Square Stand aims to turn the Apple iPad into a more complete point of sale system. It makes use of a larger reader and a rotatable base that allows the stand to be swiveled around. Square Stand took more than a year to develop and the team of around 15 was led by Jesse Dorogusker, a former Apple director of engineering for iPhone, iPod, and iPad accessories at Apple.[13] The Square Stand works with iPad 2, iPad 3rd generation (30-pin connector), and iPad Air (lightning).
Services[edit]
Square Register[edit]
Square Register is point of sale software aimed at replacing traditional credit card terminals and cash registers. Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.[14]
Square Cash[edit]
Square Cash allows person-to-person money transfer via the Square Cash app or e-mail. In March 2015, Square introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username to send and receive money, known as a $cashtag.[15]
Square Capital[edit]
In May 2014, Square launched Square Capital, which offers business financing to merchants using Square.[16] In contrast with a traditional loan, there is no time limit for a merchant to pay off a Square Capital cash advance. The merchant returns the advance to Square by paying back a percentage of their credit card sales over time.
Caviar[edit]
On August 4, 2014, Square announced the acquisition of Caviar, a startup that delivers meals from high-end restaurants.[17] Caviar uses a fleet of couriers to provide delivery for popular restaurants who do not otherwise deliver.[18] Caviar is currently available in 18 markets in the U.S.[19] Users can order via the company's iOS or Android app,[20] or on Caviar's website.[21]
Caviar eventually replaced Square Order, an app which allowed users to make purchases in advance and pick them up at a predetermined time. In March 2015, Square announced that it was shutting down Square Order to focus on other efforts.[22]
Customer Engagement[edit]
In April 2015, Square launched Customer Engagement, a suite of CRM tools which includes email marketing services. These tools allow businesses to target customer audiences with customized or different messages and promotions based on actual (offline) purchase behavior.[23]
Square Payroll[edit]
In June 2015, Square launched Square Payroll, a tool for small business owners to process payroll for their employees. The product, currently available in Alaska, California, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and New Hampshire, automatically handles a business' withholdings, payroll payments, and tax filings.[24]

Financials[edit]
Square received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[25] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:

Series A funding from Khosla Ventures[25]
Series B funding from Sequoia Capital[25]
Series C funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers[25]
Series D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[26]
Series E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[27]

The company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[28]
On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. Although the firm has yet to make a profit and has lost $420 million since 2012, it has decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the 6 months leading up to its IPO. [29]
Business[edit]
Operations[edit]
Square was co-founded by Twitter creator Jack Dorsey.[30] Dorsey also serves as chief executive officer and Sarah Friar serves as chief financial officer.[30]
Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[31] Square has more than 1000 employees.[26]
Square has been available in the United States since 2010 and became international when the company launched in Canada at the end of 2012.[32] In May 2013, Square announced that its mobile payments service was available in Japan after agreeing to a partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card Corporation. The fee for transactions would be 3.25% in Japan.[33]
Square's Board of Directors includes Dorsey, McKelvey, Roelof Botha, Vinod Khosla, Mary Meeker, former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, former CFO of Goldman Sachs David Viniar, and businessman and NBA hall-of-famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson.[34]
Business model[edit]
As of March 2013, Square provides its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.[35] Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.[36] The Square app is also freely downloadable from the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Square charges a fee of 2.75% on every credit card transaction.[37] Square does not have any additional fees beyond the 2.75% per swipe (or the 3.50% plus $0.15 cost per manually-entered transaction) and there are no monthly fees or set-up costs. Square claims that its costs are, on average, lower than the costs charged by the conventional credit card processors.[38] Square is regarded as a useful app for entrepreneurs, including, for example, consultants, food truck operators, and traditional retailers.[39] Swiped payments are deposited directly into a user's bank account within 1 or 2 business days. In some instances, Square may withhold payments to its users pending issues related to chargebacks.[40]
Square also generates revenue from selling other services to businesses, including subscription-based products such as Customer Engagement, Square Payroll, and Square Register. For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 and $5 for each employee paid.[41]
Growth[edit]
At the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet[42]) and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a tab and pay for their order by providing their name (or a barcode) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.
In August 2012, Starbucks announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card. In February 2014, Whole Foods Market announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.[43]
In July 2013, Square launched Square Market, which allows sellers to create a free online storefront with online payment processing functionality.[44] In March 2014, Square announced it will start allowing sellers to accept bitcoin on their own storefronts through Square Market. The seller will take no risk on bitcoin value fluctuations.[45]
In August 2014, Square secured an investment from Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, to extend "hundreds of millions of dollars" to small businesses via Square Capital.[46] In May 2015, Square secured additional outside investments for Square Capital, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[47] In its 2016 third quarter earnings report, Square reported that it had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[48] In October 2015, Square Inc. filed an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[49] Shares were priced at $9 on November 18, 2015, and on November 19, 2015 Square officially began trading. [50]
Reception[edit]
In the media[edit]
Business Insider praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". Business Insider favorably compared Jack Dorsey with Steve Jobs for what they call his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".[51][52] The Next Web praised Square's website squareup.com for its design and aesthetic appeal.[53] The product was also showcased at Apple's iPad 2 event.[54] GigaOM called the product a disruptive innovation.[55]
Customer feedback[edit]
Most complaints emerge from an unsatisfying customer support.[56][57] The main reason for inquiries originate from suspended accounts with money on the hold due to alleged illegal business which infringes against Square's terms. The website cardpaymentoptions.com states that "[t]he majority of the complaints fall into three areas: virtually nonexistent phone support, misunderstanding and nondisclosure of its former $2,002 card-not-present deposit hold policy, and reports of random fund holding or account deactivation exceeding 30 days with no explanation or communication from Square."[58]
Banned transactions[edit]
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended the terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or ... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.[59]
