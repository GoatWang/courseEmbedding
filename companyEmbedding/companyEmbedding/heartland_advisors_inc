	Heartland Advisors is a boutique, independent investment firm in Milwaukee, WI. Our value-focused, actively managed product suite includes distinct U.S. and international investing strategies, which are offered through five mutual funds and four separately managed accounts.

Learn About Our History

	Value-Focused, Actively Managed Product Suite

	Our approach is consistent across all of our products, however, we believe each portfolio serves a distinct role and is constructed accordingly. Some of our portfolios emphasize dividends to mitigate volatility and to provide a modest stream of income while others seek to diversify risk and increase opportunity by holding stocks with varying market caps. The ultimate goal with each is to provide superior risk adjusted returns and limit downside participation.

Fund

	Investing Process

	Heartland defines value using our proprietary, consistent, and time-tested 10 Principles of Value Investing™.

	Our Investment Team applies a bottom-up approach that combines traditional fundamental analysis as well as meetings with management, competitors, and end clients of the businesses we consider for investment.

We managed about $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2017, and our team collectively owned more than $34 million in our Funds as of March 31, 2017.

Firm Culture

	Our week begins with what Heartlanders affectionately refer to as the “Monday Morning Meeting,” when analysts, portfolio managers, and other key team members come together to discuss economic releases, market dynamics, and industry analysis. Similarly, each week ends with the Investment Team assembled in our Ben Graham conference room—aptly named for the founder of the Firm’s value investing style—for the “Research Meeting,” focused on stock specific research.

	The agendas vary, but the goal of each is consistent—sharing, digesting, and interpreting information that will give us an advantage when competing in the marketplace.

	These meetings are open to all team members, and relationship managers regularly attend to represent the eyes, ears, and voices of our clients. The discussions reflect our Midwestern roots in that debates are candid and purposeful with spirited conversations focused on achieving excellence in our investment decisions. All Investment Team members participate on equal footing and are encouraged to express alternate views. Portfolio managers serve in the role of engaged leaders—not unapproachable stars.

	Our quest for constant never ending improvement (CNEI) extends beyond the Investment Team. Whether it is earning professional designations or enrolling in classes to develop new skills, team members across the Firm are strongly encouraged in their pursuit of professional and personal growth.

	We also bring our passionate approach to causes beyond investing. High importance is placed on giving back to the community, and team members are encouraged to regularly volunteer their time and skills. Our sponsorship of the many local causes we support is deliberate—we support the organizations our team members are most passionate about and in which they are directly involved.

	Beyond our value investment philosophy and core business, Heartland is a Firm where camaraderie among coworkers is genuine. From lunches with department heads to the longstanding tradition of new team members providing entertainment at the annual holiday party, inherent respect creates an environment for people to confidently share ideas and information.

	Board of Directors & Firm Governance

	The investment management, trading, and operational functions of Heartland are governed by comprehensive policies, procedures, and oversight bodies.

	In addition to stocks of large companies, the Funds invest in small- and mid-sized companies that are generally less liquid and more volatile than large companies. The Select Value, Mid Cap Fund, and Value Plus Funds invest in a smaller number of stocks (generally 40 to 60, 30 to 60, and 40 to 70, respectively) than the average mutual fund. The performance of these holdings generally will increase the volatility of the Funds’ returns. The International Value Fund invests in foreign securities which have additional risks, including but not limited to, exchange rate changes, political and economic upheaval, and relatively low market liquidity. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. There can be no assurance that the Mid Cap Value Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case the Board of Directors may determine to liquidate the Fund.

	Value investments are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may not be recognized by the broad market.

	There is no assurance that dividend-paying stocks will mitigate volatility.

Our approach is consistent across all of our products, however, we believe each portfolio serves a distinct role and is constructed accordingly. Some of our portfolios emphasize dividends to mitigate volatility and to provide a modest stream of income while others seek to diversify risk and increase opportunity by holding stocks with varying market caps. The ultimate goal with each is to provide superior risk adjusted returns and limit downside participation.

	In addition to stocks of large companies, the Funds invest in small- and mid-sized companies that are generally less liquid and more volatile than large companies. The Select Value, Mid Cap Fund, and Value Plus Funds invest in a smaller number of stocks (generally 40 to 60, 30 to 60, and 40 to 70, respectively) than the average mutual fund. The performance of these holdings generally will increase the volatility of the Funds’ returns. The International Value Fund invests in foreign securities which have additional risks, including but not limited to, exchange rate changes, political and economic upheaval, and relatively low market liquidity. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. There can be no assurance that the Mid Cap Value Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case the Board of Directors may determine to liquidate the Fund.

	Value investments are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may not be recognized by the broad market.

	There is no assurance that dividend-paying stocks will mitigate volatility.

	Separately managed accounts and related investment advisory services are provided by Heartland Advisors, Inc., a federally registered investment advisor. ALPS Distributors, Inc., is not affiliated with Heartland Advisors, Inc.

	Investing Process

	Heartland defines value using our proprietary, consistent, and time-tested 10 Principles of Value Investing™.

	Our Investment Team applies a bottom-up approach that combines traditional fundamental analysis as well as meetings with management, competitors, and end clients of the businesses we consider for investment.

We managed about $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2017, and our team collectively owned more than $34 million in our Funds as of March 31, 2017.

Firm Culture

	Our week begins with what Heartlanders affectionately refer to as the “Monday Morning Meeting,” when analysts, portfolio managers, and other key team members come together to discuss economic releases, market dynamics, and industry analysis. Similarly, each week ends with the Investment Team assembled in our Ben Graham conference room—aptly named for the founder of the Firm’s value investing style—for the “Research Meeting,” focused on stock specific research.

	The agendas vary, but the goal of each is consistent—sharing, digesting, and interpreting information that will give us an advantage when competing in the marketplace.

	These meetings are open to all team members, and relationship managers regularly attend to represent the eyes, ears, and voices of our clients. The discussions reflect our Midwestern roots in that debates are candid and purposeful with spirited conversations focused on achieving excellence in our investment decisions. All Investment Team members participate on equal footing and are encouraged to express alternate views. Portfolio managers serve in the role of engaged leaders—not unapproachable stars.

	Our quest for constant never ending improvement (CNEI) extends beyond the Investment Team. Whether it is earning professional designations or enrolling in classes to develop new skills, team members across the Firm are strongly encouraged in their pursuit of professional and personal growth.

	We also bring our passionate approach to causes beyond investing. High importance is placed on giving back to the community, and team members are encouraged to regularly volunteer their time and skills. Our sponsorship of the many local causes we support is deliberate—we support the organizations our team members are most passionate about and in which they are directly involved.

	Beyond our value investment philosophy and core business, Heartland is a Firm where camaraderie among coworkers is genuine. From lunches with department heads to the longstanding tradition of new team members providing entertainment at the annual holiday party, inherent respect creates an environment for people to confidently share ideas and information.

	Board of Directors & Firm Governance

	The investment management, trading, and operational functions of Heartland are governed by comprehensive policies, procedures, and oversight bodies.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance represents past performance; current returns may be lower or higher. Performance information for institutional class shares of Funds that existed prior to their initial public offering is based on the performance of investor class shares. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. All returns reflect reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of taxes that an investor would pay on distributions or redemptions. Subject to certain exceptions, shares of a Fund redeemed or exchanged within 10 days (90 days for the International Value Fund) of purchase are subject to a 2% redemption fee. Performance does not reflect this fee, which if deducted would reduce an individual's return.

In the prospectus (pdf) dated 5/1/2017, the gross expense ratios for investor class shares of the Select Value, Value Plus, and Value Funds are 1.23%, 1.19%, and 1.09%, respectively, and the gross expense ratios for institutional class shares of the Select Value, Value Plus, and Value Funds are 0.99%, 0.97%, and 0.92%, respectively. The Advisor has voluntarily agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses with respect to the institutional class, to the extent necessary to maintain the institutional class “Net Annual Operating Expenses” at a ratio not to exceed 0.99% of average daily net assets. This voluntary waiver/reimbursement may be discontinued at any time. Without such waiver and/or reimbursements, the Select Value Fund institutional class Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses would be 1.00%. Also, through 11/30/2001, the Advisor voluntarily waived a portion of the Select Value Fund's expenses. Without such waivers, total returns would have been lower. In the prospectus (pdf) dated 5/1/2017, the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement for investor and institutional class shares of the Mid Cap Value and International Value Funds is 1.25% and 0.99%, respectively. The Advisor has contractually agreed to waive its management fees and/or reimburse expenses of the Mid Cap Value and International Value Funds to ensure that Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses for the Fund do not exceed 1.25% of the Fund’s average net assets for investor class shares and 0.99% for institutional class shares, through at least 5/1/2019, and subject thereafter to annual reapproval of the agreement by the Board of Directors. Without such waiver and/or reimbursements, the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses would be 3.22% for the investor class shares and 3.46% for the institutional class shares of the Mid Cap Value Fund and 1.89% for the investor class shares and 1.63% for the institutional class shares of the International Value Fund.

	An investor should consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information may be found in the prospectus (pdf). To obtain a print prospectus, call 800-432-7856. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

	The inception dates for the Select Value, Mid Cap Value, Value Plus, Value, and International Value Funds investor class shares are 10/11/1996, 10/31/2014, 10/26/1993, 12/28/1984, and 10/1/2010, respectively. 

	Performance data quoted for periods prior to 10/1/2013 for the International Value Fund is that of the predecessor Fund (the Heartland International Value Fund a series of Trust for Professional Managers).

	In addition to stocks of large companies, the Funds invest in small- and mid-sized companies that are generally less liquid and more volatile than large companies. The Select Value, Mid Cap Fund, and Value Plus Funds invest in a smaller number of stocks (generally 40 to 60, 30 to 60, and 40 to 70, respectively) than the average mutual fund. The performance of these holdings generally will increase the volatility of the Funds’ returns. The International Value Fund invests in foreign securities which have additional risks, including but not limited to, exchange rate changes, political and economic upheaval, and relatively low market liquidity. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. There can be no assurance that the Mid Cap Value Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case the Board of Directors may determine to liquidate the Fund.

	Value investments are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may not be recognized by the broad market.

Heartland Advisors, SEC Settle Bond-Pricing Case 



        By Christine Caulfield



					Law360, New York (January 29, 2008, 12:00 AM EST) -- Broker-dealer Heartland Advisors has settled charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it lost $60 million of shareholders' money when it fraudulently mispriced bonds held in mutual funds it was being paid to manage.Without admitting the allegations, the Milwaukee-based firm and its chief executive, William Nasgovitz, agreed to pay a $3.5 million fine as part of a cease-and-desist order filed Friday.The order names six other executives — Paul Beste, Thomas Conlin, Greg Winston, Kevin Clark, Kenneth Della and Hugh Denison — who...
