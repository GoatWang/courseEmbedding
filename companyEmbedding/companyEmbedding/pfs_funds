Areas of Key Focus:



Accounting Functionality
Shareholder Record Keeping Functionality
Focus on Partnerships & Private Equity
Focus on Fund of Funds


PFS-PAXUS is a fully integrated fund administration system by design, with all components of the system consolidated within the multi-currency General Ledger. PFS-PAXUS accommodates all major fund structures and asset classes, offers multiple accounting and tax method options. PFS-PAXUS will produce intra-day valuations on demand, and will calculate both estimate NAV’s and final NAV calculations.
The NAV generation features of PFS-PAXUS include:

MULTI-CURRENCY CLASSES
Share class currency and fund base currency can be created in any combinations with the NAV calculated in the class currency and supported by general ledger posting in fund currency. Foreign currency classes can be hedged by entering financial transactions and allocating the hedges to the specific share classes.
 Contact us to find out more.



FEE CALCULATIONS
Fee calculation rules for fee types such as administration, management, performance and other accruals (i.e. audit, director, amortisations etc.) and other fund-specific fees can be defined at series level to be automatically calculated and accrued to the general ledger.
Contact us to find out more.



ALLOCATION MODELS
The system automatically allocates income and expenses across investors based on fund level allocation rules, including gross method, net method, committed capital method and fixed percent per period. The fund level default allocation rule will be used unless a specific allocation rule is specified at transaction level thus providing transaction level allocation capabilities. Specific allocation rules can be specified on transaction entry to individuals or groups of classes/series/partners.
Contact us to find out more.



GENERAL LEDGER
PFS-PAXUS is general ledger centric, built from the ground up as a multi-currency accounting engine. All transactions are posted individually to the general ledger via pre-configured accounting rules for NAV valuation and financial statement purposes. Journal entries can be posted to future, present and past value dates in any currency. Once a fund valuation is finalised a period can be locked off, preventing inadvertent postings of transactions to that period.
Contact us to find out more.



NAV CALCULATION
The NAV calculation process is centralised across all series in the fund, or for groups of funds, as a single push-button procedure. The NAV calculation supports three different rounding rules up to 8 decimal places (round off, up or down) for reporting, truncating NAV or by posting rounding entries to the general ledger. The NAVs can be dual priced for bid/offer spreads.
Contact us to find out more.



STANDARD REPORTS
There is a selection of 200+ generic PFS-PAXUS reports available, with multiple parameters and options for each. Generic reports can be run individually or as a pack, either to printer, .pdf, excel or csv. Customised SQL and report formatting can also be written (with SQL knowledge) and stored by users in the application, which can then be accessed and run by users from within the application. As an open relational database users can access the system via any Microsoft ODBC report-writing tool. A data dictionary is published to assist with SQL report writing and queries. Regulatory reporting includes US FATCA, AIFMD Annex IV, Form-PF and CRS.
Contact us to find out more.


A full list of generic reports and a sample report pack can be provided upon request: information@pacificfundsystems.com


PFS-PAXUS is a specialist accounting and administration application system for the alternative fund administration industry. Within the fund administration industry the shareholder record keeping process goes by many different names; transfer agency, investor services, shareholder services, unit registry, share registry to name but a few.
Regardless of title, PFS-PAXUS can be used to perform this function either as a fully integrated fund administration system or in isolation as a pure share registry platform as a functionally rich Shareholder Registry module exists within PFS-PAXUS.
To support the complex structures that exist in the alternatives industry such as multi-series structures, equalisation, partnerships and private equity, the share registry features of PFS-PAXUS include:


Full share registry capabilities
Investor and related party details including contact information, bank account details, regulatory information etc.
Transaction entry
Control parameters including redemption terms etc.
Fees and Commissions
Lot level tracking
Equalisation and series performance fees and consolidations
Distributions
Workflow functionality, including AML, for highly configurable control
AML Screening
Detailed diagnostic/exceptions reporting
Automated FATCA, CRS, Form-PF and AIFMD Annex IV data capture and reporting
Automated allocation, including private equity structures
Investor Communications, including encryption, for all standard communication types
Document and Image Linking
Integrated with PFS-CONNECT (web portal)
Pricing and NAV Publishing
Transaction Regeneration
Full audit trail
Cash Management

 

Key Focus Areas include:

ACCOUNTING & REGISTRY
Share registry transactions can be entered manually or can be uploaded from a formatted spreadsheet. Future trade can be entered and the estimated value of that trade will update automatically if and when NAVs are confirmed, ensuring that liquidity forecasts provide the most up to date estimates.
Contact us to find out more


SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
PFS-PAXUS allows users to record all of the necessary information relating to shareholders, brokers, intermediaries and related parties, including an extensive list of shareholder contact and identification details alongside all of the necessary regulatory and tax classification information. All records within PFS-PAXUS can be ring-fenced to ensure that only users with approved access can see or edit the relevant information. Records can be stored in encrypted format to meet specific jurisdictional requirements where necessary.
Contact us to find out more



SERIES CONSOLIDATION
PFS-PAXUS enables users to create series groups and create a new series of shares based upon an existing series of shares. At the end of the incentive fee calculation period, the series can be consolidated or ‘rolled up’ automatically into the lead series within the fund class (or any other profitable series as the fund particulars dictate).
Contact us to find out more


INVESTOR STATEMENTS
Acknowledgement letters, Contract notes, NAV statements, Transaction statements and many other types of investor communications can be generated within PFS-PAXUS ready for issue by post, to be sent by email or sent from a facsimile server. Copies can be sent to an unlimited number of related third parties as required. The Statement Builder functionality included in the application allows users to design their own statement formats and link the designs to individual funds. A language translation feature provides additional multi-lingual support.
Contact us to find out more


EQUALISATION
PFS-PAXUS fully supports the calculation and collection of incentive / performance fees via the industry standard methodologies, including series of shares method and the equalisation method to ensure that incentive fees are equitably accounted for and reported accordingly.
Contact us to find out more


DOCUMENT & IMAGE LINKING
Documents and images stored on the network can be linked to certain PFS-PAXUS system tables, the practical application of which can achieve multiple operational efficiencies. For example this functionality would allow the image of an authorised signatory list to be linked to a number of different investors, with the image link accessible via each investor record thus simplifying the signature verification process.
Contact us to find out more


AML
PFS-PAXUS supports the collection, monitoring and reporting obligations of statutory Anti-Money Laundering requirements, enabling users to define and maintain AML checklists depending on the fund, category, jurisdiction and/or location of the individual investor. Outstanding or outdated documentation can be easily identified and followed up with by utilising existing PFS-PAXUS reports and investor communication templates. The features of the AML module are intuitively integrated within the core Share Registry module so that users can be warned or stopped from undertaking certain actions where necessary, allowing internal policies and procedures to be incorporated and safe guarded within the system itself. Expired or outstanding AML related documentation can be automatically requested and chased up. With regards to the ongoing and timely monitoring of all counterparty information against World-Check, PFS-PAXUS is able to interface with third party software to actively facilitate this important process. PFS-PAXUS system administrators can implement, monitor, report and change all AML related controls where necessary, demonstrating compliance and evidencing active follow up where needed.
Contact us to find out more


AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS
Shareholder transactions can be manually input, entered by the investor directly via PFS-CONNECT, uploaded via a trade file or via interface.
An interface with the Calastone network permits PFS-PAXUS to process share registry transactions received through the Calastone global transaction network.
Contact us to find out more


REGULATORY REPORTING
PFS-PAXUS contains detailed and comprehensive functionality to manage regulatory global and local reporting responsibilities, including FATCA, FINRA’s Private Fund Reporting Depository for Hedge Funds, Annex IV, Form PF, CRS (Common Reporting Standards). A number of regional regulatory and tax reports exist for various jurisdictions including Luxembourg, Australia, Canada, USA and UK. More details are available on request.
Contact us to find out more


INTEGRATED OPERATIONAL WORKFLOWS
PFS-PAXUS allows users to record all of the necessary information relating to shareholders, brokers, intermediaries and a workflow module tracks user-defined workflow checks against each share registry transaction and controls system actions according to fund level preferences. Automated chaser letters can be generated to follow up with investors for missing documentation.

Primerica - Investments




















Primerica











Investments
Primerica has been helping Main Street families invest for the future since 1977. While many financial professionals simply aren't interested in working with the middle class,* Primerica is committed to helping Main Street families save and invest for their short-term and long-term goals.  






			Mutual Funds
			




Mutual funds are one of the most effective long-term savings vehicles. Mutual funds are a great way to "become an owner, not a loaner." They give average families access to an investment vehicle with the potential to minimize risk through professional management and diversification.
There's no doubt that investing in mutual funds involves risk. But a PFS Investments representative can help you to understand those risks, and guide you to mutual funds that match your investment objectives and risk tolerance.
Primerica's Mutual Fund Partners:

AB
American Century Investments
American Funds
Invesco
Fidelity Advisor Funds
Franklin Templeton Investments
Legg Mason
MFS Investment Management
OppenheimerFunds
Pioneer Investments
Putnam Investments








			 Managed Investments
			




A managed account is accessed through an investment platform. The platform typically offers access to actively managed investment models comprised of securities selected by investment professionals.
When your account is managed through the Lifetime Investment Platform, you will have an ongoing relationship with your advisor and will receive professional money manager services, and consolidated reporting.
The Lifetime Investment Platform investment model offering provides you with access to a wide range of asset allocation strategies. Your Primerica Advisor will assist you in selecting the professional asset manager and models that will help meet your asset allocation and financial goals during your investing lifecycle. The investment models are constructed using mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETF) or a blend of both investment types. By working with your Advisor, you will be able to identify the investment model options most aligned with your personal goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and investing preferences. You can always adjust your investment plan and model selection to accommodate changing needs.







			  Annuities
			




Primerica offers two kinds of annuities products: variable annuities and fixed annuities:

Variable annuities are long-term contracts between an individual and an insurance company. Variable annuities contain both investment and insurance features and are designed specifically for retirement.
Fixed annuities are long-term contracts between an individual and an insurance company. Fixed annuities provide a fixed rate of return that is guaranteed by the issuing company.

Primerica's Annuity Partners:

Lincoln Financial Group
Brighthouse Financial
AXA
AIG








			  Business Retirement Plans
			




Primerica's 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plan offerings are individual and employer-sponsored retirement plans that grant employees the opportunity to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax-deferred basis into investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and annuities. 
Primerica's 401(k) Partners:
Preferred plan providers:

AXA
Voya
CUNA Mutual
American Funds
Fidelity Advisors

Debt Stacking










The High Cost of Waiting
Want to save $1 million by age 67? You'd better get started soon.
The longer you wait, the more you'll have to put away each month to reach your retirement goals.

27 years old? You have to put away $214 a month to reach $1 million.
Start at age 37, and you're putting away $541 a month to reach your goal.
Begin at age 47, and you'd have to put away $1,491 a month.
Wait until age 57, and you're putting away a hefty $5,168 a month.
Wait until the last minute (age 62) and you'd have to stash $13,258 a month to reach $1 million by age 67.

So, the sooner you start saving, the fewer dollars you'll have to put away each month to reach your retirement goals. Don't pay the high cost of waiting!
This example is hypothetical and does not represent an actual investment. This uses a nominal 9% rate of return, compounded monthly. It uses a constant rate of return, unlike actual investments, which will fluctuate in value. It does not include fees and taxes, which will lower results.

If you need additional financial guidance, investment professionals are available over the phone.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
*Other fees and commissions apply to a WellsTrade® account. For complete information on fees and commissions refer to the WellsTrade® Account Commissions and Fee Schedule on wellsfargo.com

What Makes Us Exceptional— And Sets Us Apart 

Masters of One. Most financial professionals are “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.” The DRL Group has taken a different approach to financial services. “We are Masters of One”, having spent decades doing one thing well: fixed-income investing. We specialize in the bond market, helping provide fixed-income solutions for our clients. You can expect this singular focus from the DRL Group.
Price-Efficient Trade Execution: Thanks to our state-of-the-art technology, DRL Group clients have access to both the primary and secondary bond markets. This provides you with efficient pricing because we can execute trades on both the buy and sell side of the transaction, which in most cases, could result in higher returns.
Municipal and Corporate Bond Specialists. Our team of professionals is focused on providing fixed-income solutions to produce a stable income stream—and help protect principal value. We create customized bond portfolios to preserve capital and minimize risk, while maximizing client returns in unpredictable market environments.
Tax Free Investment Solutions. Our clients are interested in shielding their investment income from taxes. For investors who want tax-exempt investment solutions, we can purchase at dealer level pricing, with a nominal mark up on attractive tax-free bonds. This results in higher yields for our clientele.
Well Versed with Major Market Fluctuations. With over 35 years of collective industry expertise, we have been through significant ups and downs of the economy and the market. We have extensive experience adapting our clients’ portfolios to ever-changing market conditions. We will do the same for you.
Personalized Process. All clients receive the personal attention they deserve. We take the time to understand each client’s needs based on their tax bracket, age, goals, and financial situation. We continuously analyze and update strategies to meet our clients’ evolving individual objectives for income, growth, and asset protection. And, our clients deal directly with the owners of the firm—not junior advisors or a call center. We know our clients’ time is extremely valuable, so when a client calls, we pick up the phone. You can always expect good, old-fashioned service.
Award Recognition. The DRL Group has been consistently recognized as one of Houston’s Top Wealth Managers. The National Association of Board Certified Advisory Practices (NABCAP) named us among the Top Wealth Managers two years running, and the Houston Business Journal featured us in both 2012 and 2013. We have also been showcased as one of the Best Businesses of Katy, TX, for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. You’ll be taken care of by an award-winning team.
Independent. Since we are not owned by a bank or an insurance company, we sell no proprietary, high commission products. Instead, the financial products we do offer are dependent on what’s in the best interest of our clients. All of our operations are highly regulated. Your investment funds are held at our custodian, National Financial Services, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments.
