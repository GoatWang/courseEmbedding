Famous Person


Donald William Sinclair was the co–proprietor of the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay, which he helped manage after an extensive, World War 2 career in the Royal Navy. He was the inspiration for the character Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, owing to his allegedly stuffy, snobbish and eccentric treatment of his guests, which included John Cleese and other members of the Monty Python cast.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Sinclair Donald R carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Sinclair Donald R



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
