Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

All data is provided by Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC. Data is subject to change on a daily basis and represents a percentage of the Fund’s holdings. The securities mentioned are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell.





Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, please visit the ETF performance page.  ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.
Risk Considerations Investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund, which may cause you to lose money, including the entire principal amount that you invest. Equity Risk: The value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate, or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests. Solar Energy Industry Risk: Prices of energy (including traditional sources of energy such as oil, gas, or electricity) or alternative energy may decline. The alternative energy industry can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology, short product lifecycles, falling prices and profits, competition from new market entrants and general economic conditions. This industry can also be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of alternative energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects and tax and other government regulations and policies. Companies in this industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, imposition of import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technological developments and labor relations. The solar energy industry has experienced an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon, which may place constraints on the revenue growth of solar energy companies and decrease such companies’ productivity. Solar energy companies may not be able to secure an adequate and cost-effective supply of solar wafers, cells or reclaimable silicon. If government subsidies and economic incentives for solar power are reduced or eliminated, the demand for solar energy may decline and cause corresponding declines in the revenues and profits of solar energy companies. Existing regulations and policies, and changes to such regulations and policies, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, thus reducing demand for such products. If solar power technology is not suitable for widespread adoption, or sufficient demand for solar power products does not develop or takes long periods of time to develop, the revenues of solar power companies may decline. Foreign Investment Risk: The fund’s investments in non-U.S. issuers, although generally limited to ADRs, may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers, including less market liquidity, generally greater market volatility than U.S. securities, and less complete financial information than for U.S. issuers. Small- and Medium-Sized Company Risk: Investing in securities of small- and medium-sized companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger, more established companies. Micro-Cap Company Risk: Micro-cap stocks involve substantially greater risks of loss and price fluctuations because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable (and some companies may be experiencing significant losses), and their share prices tend to be more volatile and their markets less liquid than companies with larger market capitalizations. Concentration Risk: If the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries, the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly. In such event, the value of the fund’s shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries. In addition, the funds are subject to: Non-correlation risk, Replication Management Risk, Issuer-Specific Changes and Non- Diversified Fund Risk. Please read the prospectus for more detailed Information regarding these and other risks.
