Publisher   December 8, 2016   371 Views              1SHARESShare on FBTweet ItSUBSCRIBE TO WEEKLY NEWSLETTER Global Real Estate Newsletter    December 8, 2016 – Colliers International San Diego Region announces that Carlsbad-based Newport National Corporation has acquired a 20.95 acre site containing a 146,549 square foot, Class A office building in San Diego’s Sabre Springs/ I-15 Corridor submarket for $31,360,000.The property is entitled for 325,800 square feet of multi-tenant office space. Newport National Corporation plans extensive exterior and interior renovations to the existing building and development of a second phase building creating an innovative office campus named Summit Pointe.“We are very pleased to have been selected as the buyer for this outstanding opportunity. This multi phase property represents a unique scenario of a fully entitled project in a supply constrained market with strong tenant demand from some of the San Diego’s finest companies,” said Jeffry Brusseau, Senior Vice President of Newport National Corporation.Mark McEwen and Chris Williams of Colliers International San Diego Region represented the seller, HD Supply. Newport National Corporation had no outside representation. Chris Williams of Colliers International in collaboration with Jay Alexander and Tim Olson of JLL have been retained as the leasing brokers for Summit Pointe.“Newport National Corporation recognized the unique opportunity with the existing building and confirmed entitlements for an additional 179,250 square feet of multi-tenant office space, which combined creates an unparalleled office campus that reflects the needs of forward-thinking companies today and tomorrow,” said Mark McEwen, Director of Capital Markets at Colliers International San Diego Region.“The phase I building was constructed in 2000 by the seller and features high quality building systems and materials, open floor plans, high ceilings and extensive glass line providing panoramic views with abundant natural lighting. The site provides a variety of exterior spaces for on-site amenities, and above-standard parking ratios, which creates an ideal opportunity for conversion into a highly functional creative office campus,” said Chris Williams, Associate Vice President at Colliers International San Diego Region.Newport National Corporation’s initial plans for Summit Pointe include a revised building exterior, new lobby and multi-tenant common areas with indoor/outdoor venues, a conference center with food service bistro, and modern indoor/outdoor fitness center. Plans also include enhanced outdoor site amenities including an outdoor kitchen/bar, sports courts, collaboration areas, fire pits, an event conference terrace, a food truck venue with dining areas amongst beautiful landscaping and mature shade trees, jogging trail onsite and offsite trail access for hiking, jogging or mountain biking at the Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve.“The renovation plan for Summit Pointe will bring a level of quality and design not yet seen in the I-15 corridor. There is a decided lack of large blocks of space in the market, and Summit Pointe’s location and inherent site qualities create an amazing opportunity for corporate and tech tenants in San Diego,“ said Jay Alexander, Managing Director at JLL.Newport National Corporation was advised by Michael Ramsey and Jerry Grossman with Gresham Savage Nolan & Tilden, PC and Phil Jelsma of CGS3. Talonvest helped Newport National Corporation secure $28,000,000 in financing from Los Angeles-based private lender Mesa West Capital as directed by Steve Fried, Principal and Seth Hall, Associate.

I believe that a standout place deserves the same time. Park Place Apartments in Oyster Point City Center is one of those places. The location speaks for itself, with an abundance of dining and shopping options within walking distance. I've lived all over Newport News and have never felt safer than I do walking around Oyster Point. The buildings require a key entry and parking is gated to further ensure safety. The complex has all the facilities you would look for in a luxury apartment, and added activities to make renters feel at home. The ladies at the leasing office are very pleasant and welcoming, while the maintenance staff is efficient and eager to assist. When we moved in, the apartment was spotless--not a mark on the walls or a stain on the carpet. The rental prices may seem expensive at first glance, but are actually quite comparable to other luxury apartments in Newport News. Plus, they offer discounts to certain employers and on specific units. I certainly recommend Park Place, and I find it disappointing to see so many unhappy reviews. Apartment living can be tough. I always choose the top floor to prevent having someone heavy footed above me, but if you do, you have to understand that there's only so much the leasing office can do to help. We have neighbors on both sides of our apartment, and rarely ever hear anything. As I mentioned, only those with an issue generally take the time to post a review. If you are tired of mediocre apartment living, give Park Place a call. You will be impressed. Park Place ApartmentsDavid L. ratedI lived there for 1 full year and here are the pro and cons of Park Place:Pro-Nice, Clean Fountain Park. You can play Pokemon Go there.Relatively new building. Lots of doors for some reason.Con-ROACHES. A 2in roach fell on top of me while I was sleeping. In another instance, a 1.5in bug fell on my girlfriend while she was sleeping. Hidden Fees. Apparently there is a random $125 fee for moving out. Paid it anyways because I moved to a better establishment. There is also a 10% late payment fee.Management. They were very nice when they were showing me the apartment. Not very friendly when you are a renter. This is consistent with other reviewers.Noise. I lived next to the garage. Cars are always revving up at 1:00am. I woke up to it even though I am a deep sleeper.Misled my coworker. They told her that there was a free one month promotion. When she renewed for lease, they told her the promotion was over. Coworker lost $1400 on the mix up.Note to future renters: Good luck! Beware of roaches in the vents and/or while you sleep.River Mews ApartmentsRaman C. ratedOverall I would like to give River Mews a 5-star. We had ups and downs during our stay but mostly it was good. Old management is really good whereas new hires I don't like them much. Place is clean, quite and safe. The only problem I had was bathrooms are small but that is my personal opinion. If you have any maintenance request they never gave us any problem, you ask for maintenance and mostly within same day it is done. Signing lease and move-out was simple and easy. Would definitely recommend it to my friends. :)Park Place ApartmentsMary H. ratedI have been living at Park Place for 4 years and my rent has stayed the same .  I have enjoyed living here and have had no problems with the office staff .J&K Property ManagementGerri H. ratedFirst rate company!! Jackie is always such a sweet person. Whenever I have an issue of any type, they always get right to it...done.

San Diego—Talonvest Capital Inc. has negotiated the funding of a $28 million bridge loan for the value-add acquisition of Summit Pointe in San Diego for Newport National Corp. The loan structure featured interest-only payments for the full three-year term, two one-year extension options and individual release provisions for maximum borrower flexibility. Talonvest negotiated the loan with Mesa West Capital.
Summit Pointe in San Diego
The Class A, 146,500-square-foot, four-story office building sits on 21 acres in the Sabre Springs/I-15 Corridor submarket and had a zero percent occupancy at loan closing, as the seller was the owner and sole occupant.
Newport National plans extensive exterior and interior renovations to the existing building, as well as adding on a second-phase, 179,250-square-foot building to create an innovative office campus.

Brad Stevens, Head Coach, Boston Celtics

Brad Stevens begins his third season as Head Coach for the Boston Celtics. He was named the 17th head coach in the history of the Boston Celtics on July 3, 2013.


In his second season with the Celtics, Stevens led the team to a playoff appearance with a furious finish to the season. After starting the season 16-30 the team finished the season 23-12 to clinch the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. During the month of April when the team was 7-1 he was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month and became the fifth Celtic Head Coach to win the award joining K.C. Jones, Jimmy Rodgers, Chris Ford and Glenn “Doc” Rivers. Stevens has posted a record of 65-99 (.396) in his two seasons with the team.


Stevens, 36, joined the Celtics after coaching Butler University where he boasted a 166-49 record, four league regular season championships, three league tournament titles and six trips to post-season tournament play. He has the top two single season win totals in Butler and Horizon League history, and he became the only coach in school history to lead a team to the NCAA Division I national championship game which he did twice. 


Stevens owns two Horizon League Coach of the Year awards and has rewritten the NCAA record book for Best Coaching Starts by Wins. During the 2012-13 season, he moved into the top spot on the six-year list with 165 victories. He captured the five-year record (139), moving ahead of Everett Case of North Carolina State (1947-51) in 2011-12, and he owns the three-year (89) and four-year (117) records. He is second on the two-year list with 56 wins. 


Stevens left a position as a marketing associate at Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis to pursue a career in basketball coaching. He served in a volunteer capacity in Butler’s basketball office during the summer of 2000, before eventually gaining a full-time administrative position under Thad Matta. Stevens joined the Bulldogs’ staff in 2000-01 as coordinator of basketball operations, handling a variety of administrative duties. He was offered a full-time assistant coaching position by Todd Lickliter in 2001-02. Stevens worked with Lickliter for six seasons spanning from 2001-07. During Stevens’ tenure as an assistant coach with the Bulldogs, Butler compiled a 131-61 record, won three Horizon League regular season championships and made four trips to post-season tournament play.


Stevens was introduced as the new men’s basketball head coach at Butler University on April 4, 2007, just three days after his former boss, Todd Lickliter, was named head coach at the University of Iowa. He became the third consecutive former Butler assistant coach to be named head coach of the Bulldogs, and he served under the previous two - Thad Matta and Lickliter. In his debut season in 2007-08, Stevens helped Butler become the first team in school and Horizon League history to record 30 wins. The 30-4 Bulldogs captured the Great Alaska Shootout, won a second consecutive Wooden Tradition Trophy, and wrapped up the Horizon League regular season and tournament championships. Butler won a first-round NCAA Tournament game, before falling in overtime to #5 Tennessee in the second round. The Bulldogs were ranked in the “Top 25” of the AP and ESPN/USA Today national polls for 19 consecutive weeks, including a record three weeks in the “Top 10.”  Only three coaches in NCAA Division I history - Bill Guthridge, North Carolina (34), Bill Hodges, Indiana State (33) and Jamie Dixon, Pittsburgh (31) - posted more first-year wins than Stevens did. At the age of 31, Stevens became the third-youngest Division I coach to guide his team to 30 wins - the youngest in more than half a century. 


During the 2009-10 season, Stevens led the Bulldogs to a 33-5 overall record, the Horizon League’s first 18-0 conference mark and fourth overall unbeaten record, a fourth consecutive league regular season championship, a second Horizon League Tournament crown in three years and a national runner-up finish in the NCAA Tournament. The Bulldogs were nationally-ranked for the fourth straight year, and Butler compiled a school-record, a 25-game winning streak, the longest winning streak in the nation. The Butler coach was named NABC All-District 12 Coach, and he was a finalist for several additional national coaching awards. Butler ended the season as the No. 2-ranked team in the final ESPN/USA Today national poll. 
The following season he guided Butler to a 28-10 campaign, a league-record fifth consecutive Horizon League regular season championship, a second straight league tournament title, a fifth consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament and a second straight national runner-up finish. 


In 2011-12, Stevens led a young Butler team to a 20-win season, a third place finish in the Horizon League regular season race and a return trip to post-season play. He helped the Bulldogs to the semifinals of the Horizon League Tournament and to the semifinals of the College Basketball Invitational. 


During the 2012-13 season, Butler’s first in the rugged Atlantic 10 Conference, Stevens guided the Bulldogs to 26 wins, a tie for third place in the A-10, a trip to the A-10 Tournament semifinals, a runner-up finish at the Maui Invitational and three “Top 10” victories, including a win over No. 1 Indiana. He had the Bulldogs, picked sixth in the A-10 preseason poll, ranked in the “Top 25” for 11 weeks, reaching as high as No. 9 in both the Associated Press and the USA Today national polls. 


Stevens earned a B.A. degree in economics from DePauw in 1999. He was a four-year member of the basketball team at DePauw, earning the squad’s “Coaches Award” in 1998-99. He and his wife, Tracy, have two children, son Brady and daughter Kinsley.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets

Learn:A Basic OverviewWhich BTU is right for you?Frequently Asked QuestionsStaff Review: Top 5 Portable Air ConditionersView All ArticlesPortable Air Conditioners: The Most Versatile Cooling SolutionPortable air conditioners are an alternative cooling solution that is able to be easily moved when needed elsewhere. Residential portable air conditioners range from 7,000 to 14,000 BTUs and are meant to cool areas up to 600 sq. ft. Commercial portable air conditioners are offered in both water cooled and air cooled models and range from 13,000 to 120,000 BTUs. These powerful units are meant to cool special equipment in large warehouses or factories.Since portable air conditioners are essential air movers, moving out hot air and replacing it with cooled air, they have to an outlet for the ventilation of warm air and moisture. Many residential portable air conditioners are vented through a nearby window using an included window vent kit, but accessories are available for ceiling and sliding door ventilation. Many commercial portable air conditioners are vented through the ceiling. Depending on the situation, other ventilation applications can be used. Other portable air conditioner accessories include window locks, filters, and remote controls.When shopping for a portable air conditioner, you’ll want to focus on the cooling power and square footage the unit can cover. These two units of measurement typically coincide; larger BTUs are associated with larger coverage.There are many benefits to using a portable air conditioner rather than a traditional cooling system. Other than the mobility factor, you have the ability to spot cool areas of habitation or concern, rather than using an entire central system. In commercial settings, portable air conditioners can be used to cool special equipment on weekends and after hours, giving business owners the freedom to use central systems less.×Login or sign up to save a list ofYour FavoritesLoginorSign Up×CloseSubmitPlease enter a valid email address!Thanks for Subscribing!We respect your privacy and promise to never spam you.

Ice Makers: A Basic OverviewTop 5 Ice MakersTop 5 Ice Makers11 Frequently Asked Questions About Undercounter Ice MakersIce Makers & Ice Machines: No more bags of melted ice or last minute trips to the storeIce is a commodity that many people and businesses use in their everyday activities. Not many people stop to consider the source unless they find themselves without. If you have a large family, love to entertain, or own your own business, you must consider the benefits of owning your own ice maker. Whether your needs or residential or commercial, an ice maker or ice machine is a reliable source for everyday ice use.Residential ice makers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small and compact portable ice makers to sleek built-in ice makers. These are perfect for small-scale ice needs and venues, such as your home, office, or small business.There are also different types of commercial ice machines, such as modular and self-contained ice units. Commercial units are ideal for large-scale ice needs and venues, such as schools, hospitals, restaurants, and bars. Modular ice machines require a separate ice bin for storage purposes. Different ice machines make different types of ice, as well.If you’re looking for a particular style of ice, you should shop by ice type. Bullet, clear, crescent, cube, gourmet , flake, and nugget/pearl are some of the options you can choose from.You must consider both the production and storage capacity when shopping for an ice maker. The production capacity is how much ice the machine can produce in a 24 hour period, while storage capacity is how much ice the unit can store at any given time. Many ice machines will suspend ice production once capacity is reached.Whether your needs are large or small, consider how a residential ice maker or commercial ice machine can offer automated ice production, completely eliminating the hassle of finding a reliable source elsewhere.×Login or sign up to save a list ofYour FavoritesLoginorSign Up×CloseSubmitPlease enter a valid email address!Thanks for Subscribing!We respect your privacy and promise to never spam you.
