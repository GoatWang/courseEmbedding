Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Bluebird Prepaid Card


                                            Bluebird is okay, but the issue I have is not many establishments accept American Express. I went to a gas station and swiped at the pump and received an error. So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on "E". It's a good thing...show more

                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Mr. DeRoberts has served as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of The Arlington Bank, an Ohio state-chartered bank with locations in Grandview Heights and Upper Arlington, Ohio, since 1999. He also served as a member of the Board of The Miami University Foundation, Oxford, Ohio, from January 2012 to December 2014. 



The Nominating Committee and the full Board of Directors believe that the attributes, skills and qualifications Mr. DeRoberts has developed through more than 31 years of consulting with financial institutions on insurance and risk management practices, as well as his service as a director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and with The Arlington Bank, allow him to provide insurance and risk management expertise as well as general banking and finance knowledge to the Board of Directors and have recommended his re-election as a Park director.
