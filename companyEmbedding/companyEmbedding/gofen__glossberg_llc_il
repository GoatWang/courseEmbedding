Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba.

    Our History Client Services Our Approach Professional Team Contact Client Portal  












Our History Founded in 1932, Gofen and Glossberg L.L.C. has provided investment guidance to generations of clients.  We have navigated portfolios through all market cycles ranging from deep recession to robust growth.  Our successful long-term approach to wealth management is shaped by our depth of investment experience, our understanding of how different market environments influence our clients’ financial well-being, and our commitment to personalized service. 









1932



Gofen and Glossberg, L.L.C.
In the depths of the Great Depression, Samuel Gofen and William Glossberg established the investment counselling firm of Gofen and Glossberg.  Our founders’ vision was the same then as it is today:  to help clients achieve their financial goals through wise investment guidance.









1945



World War II Ends
The end of WWII marked the beginning of the postwar economic boom, a period of economic growth and prosperity that lasted for more than two decades.  The firm’s clients rode the wave of prosperity with investment portfolios that benefited from the rise of the middle class, greater demand for housing and automobiles, and the need for greater infrastructure development.  During this period, the second generation of Gofen and Glossberg, Bill Gofen and Joe Glossberg, joined the firm.








1973



OPEC Oil Embargo
OPEC drove oil prices skyward in the early 1970s, triggering high inflation and a steep decline in stocks.  Investors suffered through a decade of slow economic growth and weak markets.  Positive trends that emerged as a result of the oil embargo, however, included a shift to alternate energy sources, a push for more fuel-efficient means of transportation, and a focus on new areas of energy exploration.









1980



The Fed Under Volcker
Fed Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to 20%, sending the economy into recession but ultimately ending the long period of stagflation and setting the stage for the robust economic growth of the 1980s and 1990s.









1995



Netscape IPO
The Initial Public Offering of web browser company Netscape marked the beginning of the “dot-com” bull market of 1995-99.  Technology stocks soared to extreme valuations amid the market exuberance, but the bubble burst in 2000.








2008



The Housing Crisis
Easy lending policies and limited regulatory oversight fueled a multi-year rise in housing formation and a spike in home prices.  When housing prices declined, foreclosures rose, credit dried up, the U.S. economy fell into a deep recession and the stock market declined by more than 50%.  Ultimately, with significant assistance from the Fed, the U.S. economy turned the corner and the stock market eventually reached new highs.

History










Home/ Timeline



 










1932 - Gofen and Glossberg, L.L.C.
In the depths of the Great Depression, Samuel Gofen and William Glossberg established the investment counselling firm of Gofen and Glossberg.  Our founders’ vision was the same then as it is today:  to help clients achieve their financial goals through wise investment guidance.







1945 - World War II Ends
The end of WWII marked the beginning of the postwar economic boom, a period of economic growth and prosperity that lasted for more than two decades.  The firm’s clients rode the wave of prosperity with investment portfolios that benefited from the rise of the middle class, greater demand for housing and automobiles, and the need for greater infrastructure development.  During this period, the second generation of Gofen and Glossberg, Bill Gofen and Joe Glossberg, joined the firm.







1973 - OPEC Oil Embargo
OPEC drove oil prices skyward in the early 1970s, triggering high inflation and a steep decline in stocks.  Investors suffered through a decade of slow economic growth and weak markets.  Positive trends that emerged as a result of the oil embargo, however, included a shift to alternate energy sources, a push for more fuel-efficient means of transportation, and a focus on new areas of energy exploration.







1980 - The Fed Under Volcker
Fed Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to 20%, sending the economy into recession but ultimately ending the long period of stagflation and setting the stage for the robust economic growth of the 1980s and 1990s.







1995 - Netscape IPO
The Initial Public Offering of web browser company Netscape marked the beginning of the “dot-com” bull market of 1995-99.  Technology stocks soared to extreme valuations amid the market exuberance, but the bubble burst in 2000.







2008 - The Housing Crisis
Easy lending policies and limited regulatory oversight fueled a multi-year rise in housing formation and a spike in home prices.  When housing prices declined, foreclosures rose, credit dried up, the U.S. economy fell into a deep recession and the stock market declined by more than 50%.  Ultimately, with significant assistance from the Fed, the U.S. economy turned the corner and the stock market eventually reached new highs.
