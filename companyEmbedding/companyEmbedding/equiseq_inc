The series included an examination of genetic research being done at Oklahoma’s Langston University to help goat producers, and a look the work of Agric-Bioformatics.Lexi Palmer can tell when a horse is suffering, how it nips and bucks when the pain seizes up the hindquarters and the muscles begin to waste away.She recognizes how hard it is for horse owners to look into the big brown eyes of their companion horse and not be able to communicate to their animal why it is in pain, why it will always be in pain and why it will eventually die because of a muscle wasting disease that has no cure.“I saw an episode and it was terrible,” said Palmer. “You could look in the horse’s eyes and see she was tired, could see she was in pain. The horses are your best friends, and you are so in tune with that horse, so you are in pain with them. It’s like watching a family member slowly deteriorate, and there’s nothing you can do about it.”Horse owners and breeders can, however, now test their horses for the marker that indicates they carry the gene for Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy type 2 (PSSM2) and another similar disease that are common in horses like thoroughbreds and quarter horses, thanks to a New Mexico-based startup called EquiSeq, Inc.EquiSeq began in February of 2015, and for Palmer, the company’s 23-year-old CEO, the job is more a passion for helping the equine community than it is about making bank. A horse lover and rider herself, Palmer said the research at EquiSeq is changing the horse industry in only the best ways, despite some push-back from breeders.Researchers at EquiSeq have identified a genetic variant that is associated with PSSM2. The genetic variant alters a gene that is required in skeletal muscle. Before, PSSM2 could only be determined when symptoms of exercise intolerance occurred and the horses tested negative for a genetic variant of glycogen synthase associated with PSSM1 (GYS1-R309H or P1).Developing the genetic testing for this specific type of disease in horses wasn’t exactly what EquiSeq founder Paul Szauter planned to do. After teaching genomics at one university, he decided he would launch his own company that could quickly and cheaply sequence a genome using University of New Mexico technology.He then branched out into a business accelerator program in order to start a new company with a different model. Working through ABQid, a bootcamp and accelerator program for entrepreneurs in New Mexico, Szauter participated in “Idea Hack” sessions to develop a workable innovation.Through ABQid, Szauter’s Equiseq, which develops genetic horse tests for breeders, won first place at the 2015 New Mexico Pitch Fiesta, an annual competition in which aspiring entrepreneurs present their business ideas in two-minute “elevator pitches.” A panel of four serial entrepreneurs judged the presentations, awarding a first-place cash prize of $400 to Equiseq, a graduate of the ABQid startup accelerator program.“Investor interest started to heat up in the other company that was housing EquiSeq activity, and we had to spin it off, but they said I couldn’t be CEO of two companies,” Szauter said. “So that’s when Lexi walked in and became the CEO.”Palmer had just graduated from college and was desperate to do any job that was not a typical 9 to 5.“I loved horses and did a lot of riding, so I knew a lot of people in the industry,” she said. “Paul asked me if I knew anything about science. I said, ‘I know absolutely nothing about science, but I’ll learn.’”And she did. Several times a week, Palmer and Szauter sat down together to unravel the science behind genomics. Szauter had the lingo and technical information and Palmer translated that sophisticated knowledge into easy-to-understand language for consumers.“We picked a problem that we thought would be a good place to start, which was a genetic muscle disorder that was common in quarter horses, and the age of onset is after the usual breeding age of most horses,” Szauter said.“There is no way to eliminate it from quarter horses without a genetic test.”No one had discovered which genes cause the disorder, but Szauter and his team found they could sequence horse genomes to pinpoint which gene mutation caused the disorder. While researching the disease, the EquiSeq team stumbled across a Facebook group for owners of horses with the disease.Members of the group began sharing information and DNA samples with the company, and EquiSeq had DNA samples from 250 horses from which to launch their research.“We found the gene pretty fast, in about three weeks,” Szauter said. “The data we collect is sick. It makes astronomical look like a puny word. In the first five months, we collected 1.5 terrabytes of data. Comparing what we have to the public horse database, they have 5 million variants and we have 20 million variants.”The company was able to develop a test that identifies horses at risk for developing PSSM2 before they show any symptoms.“This will help change the equine industry. Our goal is to make our own test obsolete by having horses born without these diseases,” said Palmer. “Our clients are breeders and breed organizations, because that starts the domino effect.”Identifying horses with the genetic mutation for PSSM2 means those horses could be removed from the breeding pool, thus removing that genetic variant from future horses. The company is now working on a second test for a similar disorder that affects thoroughbreds.Future plans include developing a test for a neuromuscular disease called shivers and being able to offer full gene sequencing for horses.“We have had some push back because there are those who will suffer financial harm,” Palmer said. “If 20 percent of your stock has the gene variant, then you lose money by not breeding that 20 percent. But in the long run, it’s not about me or Paul or the company. It’s about the horse community. It’s about breeding out these diseases.”This article was first featured on Silicon66.com, and was written by Heide Brandes.Silicon66 covers technology news and the entrepreneurial communities in the “Silicon66” region, including Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle, New Mexico and Arizona.ShareNever miss a story from Rob Ingram, when you sign up for Medium.

Acceptance of Terms
Your use of EquiSeq's Services (excluding any services provided by EquiSeq under a separate agreement) is subject to the terms of the legal agreement between you and EquiSeq set forth in these Terms of Service ("TOS"). Except as specified herein, these TOS apply to any use of the Services, including but not limited to a) submitting a hair, blood, or tissue sample for DNA extraction and processing, b) uploading a digital version of your horse's Genetic Information and interacting with it on the EquiSeq website, and/or c) creating and using a free EquiSeq account without providing hair, blood, or tissue samples or Genetic Information. In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the TOS. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the TOS. You can accept the TOS by (1) clicking to accept or agree to the TOS, where this option is made available to you by EquiSeq for any Service; or by (2) actually using the Services. In this case, you acknowledge and agree that EquiSeq will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the TOS from that point onwards. In addition, when using particular EquiSeq Services, you shall be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such services that may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. EquiSeq also may offer other services from time to time that are governed by different terms of service.

Prerequisites

Whether you submit a hair, blood, or tissue sample for a horse that you own, a hair, blood, or tissue sample on behalf anyone for whom you have legal authority to agree, or otherwise provide your own Genetic Information, you may not use the Services and may not accept the TOS if (1) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with EquiSeq, or (2) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.
In addition to the conditions above, if you contribute or otherwise provide Genetic Information, you must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to agree to these TOS on behalf of yourself or those for whom you have legal authority to agree.
If your use of the Services includes creating an EquiSeq account, without submitting a hair, blood, or tissue sample or otherwise providing Genetic Information, you must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to use the Services and accept the TOS.


Description of the Services
The Services include access to the EquiSeq public website and equine genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of hair, blood, or tissue samples. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or enhances the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided "AS-IS" and are based on the current state of the art of genetic research and technology in use by EquiSeq at the time of the purchase or viewing. As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, EquiSeq is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which EquiSeq provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that EquiSeq may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at EquiSeq's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform EquiSeq when you stop using the Services unless you are requesting closure of your account. EquiSeq assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms of this TOS or other applicable terms.
In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. You are solely responsible for paying such fees. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such Internet connection, including a computer and modem or other access device. You are solely responsible for providing such equipment. You acknowledge and agree that while EquiSeq may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by EquiSeq at any time, at EquiSeq's discretion.

Risks and Considerations Regarding EquiSeq Services
Once you obtain Genetic Information on your horse, the knowledge is irrevocable. You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive. You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the meaning of your horse's DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain further services from EquiSeq, your veterinarian, an equine researcher, or other health care provider.
We encourage you to talk to your veterinarian prior to collecting your horse's sample for testing to learn more so you can make an informed decision about whether testing is right for you. Your veterinarian also can help you understand your results and options.
You may learn information about your horse that you do not anticipate. This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your life and worldview. You may discover things about your horse that trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g., surprising facts related to your horse's ancestry, or that horses with your horse's genotype have a higher than average chance of developing a specific condition or disease). These outcomes could have social, legal, or economic implications.
The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors. The laboratory may not be able to process your sample if your hair, blood, or tissue sample does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA, you do not provide enough hair, blood, or tissue, or the results from processing do not meet our standards for accuracy.* If the initial processing fails for any of these reasons, EquiSeq will reprocess the same sample at no charge to the user. If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, EquiSeq will offer to collect a second sample at no charge. If the user declines this option, the user is entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to EquiSeq, less shipping and handling, provided that the user shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service. If the user opts to submit another sample and EquiSeq's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, EquiSeq will not request additional samples and the user will be entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to EquiSeq, less shipping and handling, provided the user shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service. If the user breaches this policy agreement and resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the service and processing is not successful, EquiSeq will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide the user a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as "Errors"). As this possibility is known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds where these Errors occur.
You should not change diet, exercise, medication, or other health behaviors for your horse solely on the basis of information from EquiSeq. Make sure to discuss your horse's Genetic Information with a veterinarian or other health care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from EquiSeq Services. For some diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes or environmental factors that are far more important predictors. If your data indicate that your horse is not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that your horse is protected. The opposite is also true; if your data indicate your horse is at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean that your horse will definitively develop the disease or condition. In either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through EquiSeq, you should contact your veterinarian or other health care provider.
Genetic research is not comprehensive. While we may measure many millions of data points from your DNA sample, only a small percentage of them are known to be related to equine traits or health conditions. The research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important mission of EquiSeq is to conduct and contribute to this research. In addition, some breeds are not well represented in genetic studies. Because interpretations provided in our service rely on these published studies, some interpretations may not apply to your horse. Future scientific research may change the interpretation of your horse's DNA. In the future, the scientific community may show previous research to be incomplete or inaccurate.
Genetic Information that you share with others could be used against your interests. You should consider carefully before sharing your horse's Genetic Information with others. You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your horse's Genetic Information before you share it with anybody. Sharing your horse's Genetic Information may also allow other people to infer Genetic Information about related horses that you do not own, which might have an adverse effect on the interests of the owners of these horses.
Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your veterinarian or other health care provider may become part of your horse's medical record and through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or insurance companies in the future. Genetic Information that you share with family, friends, or other people in the horse industry may be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. If you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about health conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.
EquiSeq Services are for research, informational, and educational use only. We do not provide veterinary advice. The Genetic Information provided by EquiSeq is for research, informational, and educational use only. This means two things. First, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. Second, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical application of genetic knowledge in veterinary care, we invite all horse owners with genotyped horses to participate in EquiSeq Research. Participation in such research is voluntary and based upon a consent document. As a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our Services are for research, informational, and educational purposes only. The Services are not intended to be used by the customer for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional veterinary advice. You should always seek the advice of your veterinarian or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your horse's health.
EquiSeq does not endorse, warranty or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action, resources, tests, veterinary or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our website. If we provide to you on our website any recommendations that identify for your horse, based on Genetic and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature or research, potentially actionable information, this information is intended for informational purposes only and for discussion with your veterinarian or other healthcare provider. As explained on our website, EquiSeq believes that (a) genetics is only part of the picture of any horse's state of health, (b) the state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly evolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture of the role of genetics, and (c) only a trained veterinarian or other health care provider can assess your horse's current state of health or disease, taking into account many factors, including in some cases your horse's genetics as well as your horse's current symptoms, if any. Reliance on any information provided by EquiSeq, EquiSeq employees, others appearing on our website at the invitation of EquiSeq, or other visitors to our website is solely at your own risk.
We are not universally licensed by all state, federal, or international authorities for genetic testing conducted for health and disease-related purposes. In addition, there may be certain jurisdictions in which we do not offer our Services because we do not have required licenses.

User Representations
By accessing EquiSeq Services, you agree to, acknowledge, and represent as follows:

You understand that information you learn from EquiSeq is not designed to independently diagnose, prevent, or treat any condition or disease or to ascertain the state of your horse's health in the absence of medical and clinical information. You understand that the EquiSeq services are intended for research, informational, and educational purposes only, and that while EquiSeq information might point to a diagnosis or to a possible treatment, it should always be confirmed and supplemented by additional veterinary and clinical testing and information. You acknowledge that EquiSeq urges you to seek the advice of your veterinarian or other health care provider if you have questions or concerns arising from your horse's Genetic Information.
You give permission to EquiSeq, its contractors, successors and assignees to perform genotyping services on the DNA extracted from your hair, blood, or tissue sample and you specifically request EquiSeq to disclose the results of analyses performed on your horse's DNA to you and to others you specifically authorize.

You acknowledge and agree that EquiSeq shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Services.

Miscellaneous

Entire Agreement. The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and EquiSeq and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and EquiSeq on this subject. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software

Paul Szauter says he’s getting his pitch together “to get a second date,” with some of the investors that will be in the crowd at the ABQid Demo Day.
Demo Day for ABQid is still two weeks away, but the CEOs are just now putting the final touches on their six-minute pitches for the event.

For Szauter, the CEO of the startup EquiSeq, it hasn’t been easy.




“Maybe there’s a better way than a bar fight,” he said. “The pitch practice is hand-to-hand combat. They parse every word with you.”
The idea is to get a CEO to be able to talk about their startup in the most efficient, comprehensive, and emotional way possible, he said. Each of the companies that will present at Demo Day has been honing their pitches with coaches from the accelerator program for weeks, in the hopes that they’ll find some traction with investors that will be invited to hear them speak at the Epicenter — for that second date.
But ABQid isn’t just about the pitch. The program takes the companies through the rigorous lean startup method, where they test, and test and test their products in front of potential customers for weeks, until they land on a product idea that really gets traction. Often, the idea is significantly different from the original company idea.
In Szauter’s case, he went into ABQid with EquiSeq hoping to sequence horse genomes to help breeders find the best way to maximize a horse.
But, he said, as the company tested that market, it wasn’t the best way to go.




 


“One of the things about the accelerator is going out and really talking to people. Nominally, I have these research forms. But what that does is, it forces you to talk,” Szauter said.
He found out that nobody cares about the genetics of their horses – unless their horses could pass on a certain devastating muscle disease.
“The key thing is, the science is easy,” he said. “The thing is learning how to talk to horse people.”

EquiSeq did pivot, and instead of sequencing a horse’s genome, it is planning to test horses for the possibilities of passing on a certain gene.
That pivot, he said, has led him to a devoted group of horse lovers who are dealing with the disease.
“The key thing with any company is solving a pain point,” he said. “Commercially, we are taking care of somebody’s pain.”
