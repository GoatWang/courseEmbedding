That knowledge allowed GKB to negotiate a transaction that satisfied the needs of all shareholders while allowing KCEP to effectively monetize our investment."
Bill Reisler
         Managing Director and Co-founderKansas City Equity Partners 







 
"George K. Baum embraced the key goals that I set out at the beginning of the sale process and delivered on them.  Their hard work on my behalf, senior-level advice and attention to detail during all phases of the exceptional process, made me very comfortable with my choice of financial advisor and led to an attractive outcome in terms of valuation and timing."
Dennis Baumann
         Chief Executive OfficerCentury Computer Consultants, Inc. 







 
"George K. Baum did a great job for ContiGroup.  We could not be more pleased with their work on the divestiture of our Animal Nutrition business.  They understood our objectives and exceeded our expectations throughout the process.  This included the positioning of Wayne Feeds for the market, coordinating interest from multiple parties, assisting us in negotiations of price and contract terms, and completing a highly complex transaction from start to finish in just six months."
Michael J. Zimmerman
         Executive VP and Chief Financial OfficerContiGroup Companies 







 
"From the beginning, I was confident in my choice to work with George K. Baum.  They tackled the project with intensity, creativity and excitement.  Marlen was very important to my family and me, and GKB's professionalism throughout the process showed me they understood that.  Of course, I was also very pleased with the outcome of their sale process, not only in terms of the value received for Marlen and the favorable transaction structure, but also that Marlen employees would continue to have opportunity going forward."
Harold Melcher
         Co-Founder and Majority StockholderMarlen Research Corporation

Preston Kirk is a Senior Vice President in George K. Baum & Company's Utah Public Finance Group. For three decades he has worked in the municipal bond industry analyzing and structuring bond issues for Utah issuers. During his lengthy career, he has emerged as one of the nation's most knowledgeable bankers for both refunding and new money transactions. His broad-based expertise has been utilized by issuers of general obligation bonds, utility revenue bonds (water, sewer and electric), transportation bonds, educational bonds and all types of infrastructure bonds. The state of Utah, Salt Lake County, Salt Lake City, Utah County, Sandy City, the Utah Water Finance Agency, Intermountain Power Agency, University of Utah, Metropolitan Water District, North Davis Sewer District, Utah Transit Authority, Weber School District and the Jordan School District are just a few of the hundreds of entities that have benefited from his expertise. Over the past 30 years, Mr. Kirk has been involved in the issuance of more than $26 billion of municipal bonds. He has developed innovative financing structures on behalf of county and state governments, cities, universities, special districts and nonprofit entities that have resulted in millions of dollars in savings for the taxpayers of the state.
Mr. Kirk has instituted several innovations throughout his career, including competitive sale of advance refundings, escrow restructurings, variable-rate advance refundings, first tax-credit bonds issued in Utah, BABs/Tax-Exempt hybrid structure, private placements, crossover refundings, Cinderella bonds (hybrid taxable to tax-exempt), interest rate buy-downs and recapitalization revenue bonds.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN SUMMARY




BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN SUMMARYBusiness Continuity Plan SummaryGeorge K. Baum & Company is furnishing this document to you to provide information about our efforts to ensure that you are not significantly affected as a result of an emergency or significant business disruption.
Securities industry regulations require each member firm to create and maintain a business continuity plan reasonably designed to meet its obligations to its clients and other counterparties. In accordance with these requirements, George K. Baum & Company has designed a business continuity plan to address possible scenarios in efforts to minimize the impact to your account.
In keeping with the regulatory requirements, the business continuity plan for George K. Baum & Company is designed to address key areas of concern - including but not limited to the following:

Data back-up and recovery
All mission critical systems
Financial and operational assessments
Alternate means of communication between GKB and its customers
Alternate means of communication between GKB and its employees
Alternate physical locations of employees
Critical business constituent, bank and counter-party impact
Regulatory reporting

Communications with regulatorsHow George K. Baum & Company will ensure that customers have access to their funds and securities in the event George K. Baum & Company determines it is unable to continue its business.Since events creating business disruptions may vary in nature and scope, George K. Baum & Company has anticipated scenarios in which the following are affected:

George K. Baum & Company headquarters location
A George K. Baum & Company branch location
A city-wide area
A regional area

Regardless of the scope of potential disruption, George K. Baum & Company intends to continue to provide service to its clients as soon as possible.
George K. Baum & Company has an alternate operations site identified in its headquarters' geographic area. In the event where the headquarters building or business district is affected, the other building can be used to help restore operations.
In the unlikely event of a citywide or regional disruption, George K. Baum & Company has established a recovery site approximately 500 miles from its headquarters that can be used to restore time sensitive functions as soon as key employees are relocated to the facility. Additionally, George K. Baum & Company would intend to take advantage of any available facilities at any of our offices that may be located in other geographical regions. In the event that any such disruption occurs, we have developed alternative service arrangements, systems, locations and contingency plans to ensure that any service is quickly restored.
At a minimum, the George K. Baum & Company business continuity plan is reviewed, updated and tested on an annual basis. Additionally, our primary internal and external application providers periodically conduct testing of their own backup capabilities to ensure that, in the event of an emergency or significant business disruption, they will be able to provide us with the critical information and applications we need to continue or promptly resume our business.
If SIPC determines that we are unable to meet our obligations to our customers or if our liabilities exceed our assets in violation of Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, SIPC may seek to appoint a trustee to disburse our assets to customers. We will assist SIPC and the trustee by providing our books and records identifying customer accounts subject to SIPC regulation.Making sure that any type of disruption does not unduly impact our clients is extremely important to us and our business continuity plan is designed to allow us to continue to provide the quality service you have come to expect from George K. Baum & Company.






CALLABLE SECURITIES POLICY PURSUANT TO FINRA RULE 4340




CALLABLE SECURITIES POLICY PURSUANT TO FINRA RULE 4340Callable Securities Policy Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4340When a security is subject to a partial redemption by the issuer, the issuer notifies GKB via a central industry depository of the number of units for the specific security to be redeemed. Upon receipt of the issuer’s notification, GKB determines the favorability of the redemption based on the current market price versus the call price. When the redemption of the callable security is made on terms that are favorable to the called parties, GKB does not include any firm or employee accounts in the pool of securities eligible to be called until all other customer positions in such securities have been called. When the redemption is made on terms that are unfavorable to the called parties, GKB does not exclude firm or employee accounts from the pool of the securities eligible to be called. Once the favorability of the redemption has been determined, GKB uses a random process designed to allocate called securities on a fair and impartial basis. The lottery process is based on a mathematical formula that determines the accounts that will be selected and the number of securities in the account that will be redeemed.

INVESTOR - FIXED INCOME RISK DISCLOSURES




INVESTOR - FIXED INCOME RISK DISCLOSURESInvestor – Fixed Income Risk Disclosures
Investing in any security involves risk and exposes the investor to potential losses on their investment. Different investment products and strategies involve different degrees of risk. Fixed income investments have a number of different risks that potential investors should be aware of in order to make an informed assessment as to whether the investment meets their risk profile. The following is a list of potential risks for of investing in fixed income securities.
Call or Prepayment risk. Call risk refers to the potential for an issuer to repay a bond before its maturity date, something that an issuer may do if interest rates decline -- much as a homeowner might refinance a mortgage loan to benefit from lower interest rates. Bond calls are less likely when interest rates are stable or moving higher. Many municipal bonds are "callable," so investors who want to hold a municipal bond to maturity should research the bond's call provisions before making a purchase. Investors in mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk – as interest rates move higher, prepayments will generally decline as the underlying mortgages become less likely to prepay. This extends the average life of the mortgage pool and increases the expected duration of the bond which may cause a decline in the current market value for the security. Even small changes in rates can have significant implications from a market value perspective. Investors with shorter-term liquidity needs or who do not have the ability to hold the securities to maturity may experience unanticipated losses.Credit risk. This is the risk that the bond issuer may experience financial problems that make it difficult or impossible to pay interest and principal in full (the failure to pay interest or principal is referred to as "default"). Credit ratings are available for many bonds. Credit ratings seek to estimate the relative credit risk of a bond as compared with other bonds, although a high rating does not reflect a prediction that the bond has no chance of defaulting.Interest rate or duration risk. Bonds have a fixed face value, known as the "par" value. If bonds are held to maturity, the investor will receive the face value amount back, plus interest that may be set at a fixed or floating rate. The bond's market price will move up as interest rates move down and it will decline as interest rates rise, so that the market value of the bond may be more or less than the par value. U.S. interest rates have been low for some time. If interest rates move higher, investors who hold a low fixed-rate municipal bond and try to sell it before it matures could lose money because of the lower market value of the bond in that environment. Duration is a measurement of a bond's sensitivity to interest rates changes. The higher the duration of a bond (generally the maturity or expected maturity of a bond), the larger the impact on the change in value when interest rates move up or down. Higher duration bonds carry more interest rate risk than lower duration bonds.
For additional information about interest rate risk, the MSRB has highlighted the impact of market interest rate movements on bond prices and yields on their website:
The Impact of Market Interest Rate Movement on Municipal Bond Prices and Yields
Inflation risk. Inflation is a general upward movement in prices. Inflation reduces purchasing power, which is a risk for investors receiving a fixed rate of interest. It also can lead to higher interest rates and, in turn, lower market value for existing bonds.
Liquidity risk. This refers to the risk that investors won't find an active market for the taxable or municipal bond, potentially preventing them from buying or selling when they want and also preventing them from obtaining a certain price for the bond. Many investors buy taxable and municipal bonds to hold them rather than to trade them, so the market for a particular bond may not be especially liquid and quoted prices for the same bond may differ.
Tax implications. Consider consulting a tax professional to discuss the bond's tax implications, including the possibility that your bond may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax or eligible for state income tax benefits. There is also a risk that the U.S. tax laws may change in the future, thereby increasing or decreasing the value of municipal bonds.






MARGIN DISCLOSURE STATEMENT




MARGIN DISCLOSURE STATEMENTMargin Disclosure StatementGeorge K. Baum & Company is furnishing this information to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing securities on margin, and to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin account. Before trading stocks in a margin account, you should carefully review the margin agreement. Please contact us regarding any questions or concerns you may have with your margin account(s).
When you purchase securities, you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow part of the purchase price from the Firm. If you choose to borrow funds from the Firm, you will open a margin account with the Firm. The securities purchased are the Firm's collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, the Firm can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with the Firm, in order to maintain the required equity in the account.
It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:

 You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. A decline in the value of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to the Firm that has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities or assets in your account(s).
The Firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). If the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements, or the Firm's higher "house" requirements, the Firm can sell the securities or other assets in any of your account held at the Firm to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any short fall in the account after such a sale.
The Firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. Some investors mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that a firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case. Most firms will attempt to notify their customers of margin calls, but they are not required to do so. However, even if a firm has contacted a customer and provided a specific date by which the customer can meet a margin call, the firm can still take necessary steps to protect its financial interests, including immediately selling the securities without notice to the customer.
You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the margin loan, the Firm has the right to decide which security to sell in order to protect its interests.
The Firm can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice. These changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause the member to liquidate or sell securities in your account(s).
You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. While an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions, a customer does not have a right to the extension.
