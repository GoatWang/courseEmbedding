Inland Residential Properties Trust, Inc. (Residential Properties Trust) is a non-traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sponsored by affiliates of Oak Brook, Illinois-based The Inland Group.[2] The Trust was founded in December 2013 and started selling common stock on February 18, 2015.[3] Residential Properties Trust will invest in stabilized Class A and B multifamily properties in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.[4]
Residential Properties Trust is a non-traded REIT,[5] which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange.[6] The shares therefore have limited or no liquidity.[7]
Residential Properties Trust will be managed by external managers[8] who charge fees or commissions when the Trust buys,[9] holds[10] or sells[11] real estate. External managers for Residential Properties Trust are controlled by affiliates of the Inland Group[12] and charge fees paid to Inland affiliates.[13] In this respect, the Trust’s structure shares similarities with the initial setup of its sister vehicle, Inland American Real Estate Trust (now known as InvenTrust Properties Corporation).[14] Inland American shareholders have been charged $1.4 Billion in related-party fees.[15] A March 2015 Wall Street Journal article described Inland American as a “zombie REIT” noting its failure to unwind, the plunge in value of its holdings, and the drastic cut to shareholder distributions.[16]
All of Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers staff or direct at least one of its external managers,[17] and they also split their time acting as directors or staff of other Inland vehicles.[18] In its SEC filings, the company disclosed that Residential Properties Trust’s officers will have conflicts of interest due to the competing demands for the time they spend between different funds, and that these might lead to them violating their fiduciary duties. The SEC filings further acknowledge that the Trust’s external managers will face conflicts of interest because of their compensation arrangements.[19] Such actions could include purchasing assets that are not in shareholders’ best interests, or negotiating higher purchase prices for assets than they otherwise would if they were not compensated based on the purchase price, among other things.[20]

Fund Management[edit]
In contrast to most publicly-traded REITs, Residential Properties Trust relies completely on external managers.[21] It has no paid staff, and is managed by five executive officers who all staff or direct one or more of the Trust’s fee-based external advisors.[22] The external advisors are owned by The Inland Group,[23] and extract fees or commissions when Residential Properties Trust buys, holds or sells real estate. Due to this setup, the fund has inherent conflicts of interest.[24]
The external advisors are tasked with running the business of the Trust, including: selecting potential real estate investments,[25] negotiating contracts, managing properties[26] and advising the board of directors on asset acquisitions and sales, among other things.[27] In return, they will earn fees through schedules laid out in agreements[28] with Residential Properties Trust. The contracts were not negotiated at arm’s-length.[29]
For example, Mitchell Sabshon is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Property Trust. He is also the President and CEO of Residential Property Trust’s business manager[30] and a director of the Trust’s dealer manager.[31] The business manager receives acquisition fees,[32] real estate sales commissions,[33] and a host of other fees[34] for its activities. The dealer manager receives commissions and fees on every share investors buy.[35]
Residential Properties Trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of Inland American.[36] At Inland American, related-party transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. These include a finding of breach of fiduciary duty by Inland American’s Special Litigation Committee,[37] a subpoena by the Illinois securities division, and problems regarding its securities renewal in California. Inland American withdrew its request for renewal of its California securities registration after regulators repeatedly raised concerns about conflicts of interest and other issues.[38] Inland American stockholders have been charged over $1.4 Billion in fees by external managers.[39]
Since 2012, Inland American has sold hundreds of assets, resulting in over $4.6 Billion in net proceeds.[40] However, the Trust has so far declined to make any special distributions of those proceeds to shareholders.[41] Instead, it is planning to use the proceeds to buy and develop more properties.[42]
Fees[edit]
The external managers of Residential Properties Trust are compensated through a set of fees charged to investors on a variety of fund transactions. Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.[43] Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors. For example, business management fees[44] and mortgage financing fees[45] reward managers, respectively, for holding onto highly valued (or even overvalued) assets for long periods of time and loading up on mortgage debt.[46]
Another fee, called an acquisition fee, is tied only to the amount of money the Trust pays for real estate.[47] Under this structure, managers do not benefit by trying to negotiate lower prices for acquisitions.[48]
Acquisition fees have been controversial at a sister Inland product, Inland Real Estate Income Trust (Income Trust).[49] Income Trust recently came under fire for its plans to purchase properties that were owned by a different Inland vehicle just months prior.[50] The Wall Street Journal dubbed the transaction a “boomerang buy”. As the Journal reported, “Inland Real Estate Income Trust Inc. said it will pay $318 million for 15 shopping centers owned until earlier this year by one of its sister REITs.”[51] Income Trust planned to charge shareholders a $5 million acquisition fee.[52] The proposed acquisition fee was on top of the portfolio’s $318 million[53] price tag and closing costs.[54] Income Trust admitted that it did not obtain independent appraisals of the properties in the portfolio.[55] On November 5, 2014, Income Trust announced that it agreed to permanently waive the acquisition fee.[56]
Competition for Deals[edit]
Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers all staff or direct one or more other Inland investment vehicles[57] that could compete with the new Trust for deals. They could also face a conflict of interest should one Inland vehicle attempt offload assets to another,[58] like the “boomerang buy” that Income Trust engaged in, as mentioned above.
Mitchell Sabshon, for instance, is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Properties Trust. He is also CEO and Director of Income Trust and a director[59] of Inland Private Capital Corp.[60] Both of these vehicles invest in multifamily products.[61]
Apartment REIT Sector[edit]
Residential Properties Trust is targeting multifamily properties.[62] In February 2015, a mutual fund manager was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’ve got more supply coming into the market than people were hoping, and we’ve had earnings reports that on the whole I’m not thrilled with.” The article noted slower growth and talk of oversupply in the apartment sector.[63]

The contracts were not negotiated at arm’s-length.[29]
For example, Mitchell Sabshon is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Property Trust. He is also the President and CEO of Residential Property Trust’s business manager[30] and a director of the Trust’s dealer manager.[31] The business manager receives acquisition fees,[32] real estate sales commissions,[33] and a host of other fees[34] for its activities. The dealer manager receives commissions and fees on every share investors buy.[35]
Residential Properties Trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of Inland American.[36] At Inland American, related-party transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.

Inland American withdrew its request for renewal of its California securities registration after regulators repeatedly raised concerns about conflicts of interest and other issues.[38] Inland American stockholders have been charged over $1.4 Billion in fees by external managers.[39]
Since 2012, Inland American has sold hundreds of assets, resulting in over $4.6 Billion in net proceeds.[40] However, the Trust has so far declined to make any special distributions of those proceeds to shareholders.[41] Instead, it is planning to use the proceeds to buy and develop more properties.[42]
Fees[edit]
The external managers of Residential Properties Trust are compensated through a set of fees charged to investors on a variety of fund transactions. Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.[43] Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors. For example, business management fees[44] and mortgage financing fees[45] reward managers, respectively, for holding onto highly valued (or even overvalued) assets for long periods of time and loading up on mortgage debt.[46]
Another fee, called an acquisition fee, is tied only to the amount of money the Trust pays for real estate.[47] Under this structure, managers do not benefit by trying to negotiate lower prices for acquisitions.[48]
Acquisition fees have been controversial at a sister Inland product, Inland Real Estate Income Trust (Income Trust).[49] Income Trust recently came under fire for its plans to purchase properties that were owned by a different Inland vehicle just months prior.[50] The Wall Street Journal dubbed the transaction a “boomerang buy”. As the Journal reported, “Inland Real Estate Income Trust Inc. said it will pay $318 million for 15 shopping centers owned until earlier this year by one of its sister REITs.”[51] Income Trust planned to charge shareholders a $5 million acquisition fee.[52] The proposed acquisition fee was on top of the portfolio’s $318 million[53] price tag and closing costs.[54] Income Trust admitted that it did not obtain independent appraisals of the properties in the portfolio.[55] On November 5, 2014, Income Trust announced that it agreed to permanently waive the acquisition fee.[56]
Competition for Deals[edit]
Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers all staff or direct one or more other Inland investment vehicles[57] that could compete with the new Trust for deals. They could also face a conflict of interest should one Inland vehicle attempt offload assets to another,[58] like the “boomerang buy” that Income Trust engaged in, as mentioned above.
Mitchell Sabshon, for instance, is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Properties Trust. He is also CEO and Director of Income Trust and a director[59] of Inland Private Capital Corp.[60] Both of these vehicles invest in multifamily products.[61]
Apartment REIT Sector[edit]
Residential Properties Trust is targeting multifamily properties.[62] In February 2015, a mutual fund manager was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’ve got more supply coming into the market than people were hoping, and we’ve had earnings reports that on the whole I’m not thrilled with.” The article noted slower growth and talk of oversupply in the apartment sector.[63]

Inland Residential Properties Trust, Inc.


Type

Real estate investment trust


Industry
Commercial Real Estate


Founded
2013[1]


Headquarters
Oak Brook, Illinois


Website
http://inland-investments.com/InlandResidentialTrust/


Inland Residential Properties Trust, Inc. (Residential Properties Trust) is a non-traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sponsored by affiliates of Oak Brook, Illinois-based The Inland Group.[2] The Trust was founded in December 2013 and started selling common stock on February 18, 2015.[3] Residential Properties Trust will invest in stabilized Class A and B multifamily properties in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.[4]
Residential Properties Trust is a non-traded REIT,[5] which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange.[6] The shares therefore have limited or no liquidity.[7]
Residential Properties Trust will be managed by external managers[8] who charge fees or commissions when the Trust buys,[9] holds[10] or sells[11] real estate. External managers for Residential Properties Trust are controlled by affiliates of the Inland Group[12] and charge fees paid to Inland affiliates.[13] In this respect, the Trust’s structure shares similarities with the initial setup of its sister vehicle, Inland American Real Estate Trust (now known as InvenTrust Properties Corporation).[14] Inland American shareholders have been charged $1.4 Billion in related-party fees.[15] A March 2015 Wall Street Journal article described Inland American as a “zombie REIT” noting its failure to unwind, the plunge in value of its holdings, and the drastic cut to shareholder distributions.[16]
All of Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers staff or direct at least one of its external managers,[17] and they also split their time acting as directors or staff of other Inland vehicles.[18] In its SEC filings, the company disclosed that Residential Properties Trust’s officers will have conflicts of interest due to the competing demands for the time they spend between different funds, and that these might lead to them violating their fiduciary duties. The SEC filings further acknowledge that the Trust’s external managers will face conflicts of interest because of their compensation arrangements.[19] Such actions could include purchasing assets that are not in shareholders’ best interests, or negotiating higher purchase prices for assets than they otherwise would if they were not compensated based on the purchase price, among other things.[20]

Fund Management[edit]
In contrast to most publicly-traded REITs, Residential Properties Trust relies completely on external managers.[21] It has no paid staff, and is managed by five executive officers who all staff or direct one or more of the Trust’s fee-based external advisors.[22] The external advisors are owned by The Inland Group,[23] and extract fees or commissions when Residential Properties Trust buys, holds or sells real estate. Due to this setup, the fund has inherent conflicts of interest.[24]
The external advisors are tasked with running the business of the Trust, including: selecting potential real estate investments,[25] negotiating contracts, managing properties[26] and advising the board of directors on asset acquisitions and sales, among other things.[27] In return, they will earn fees through schedules laid out in agreements[28] with Residential Properties Trust. The contracts were not negotiated at arm’s-length.[29]
For example, Mitchell Sabshon is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Property Trust. He is also the President and CEO of Residential Property Trust’s business manager[30] and a director of the Trust’s dealer manager.[31] The business manager receives acquisition fees,[32] real estate sales commissions,[33] and a host of other fees[34] for its activities. The dealer manager receives commissions and fees on every share investors buy.[35]
Residential Properties Trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of Inland American.[36] At Inland American, related-party transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. These include a finding of breach of fiduciary duty by Inland American’s Special Litigation Committee,[37] a subpoena by the Illinois securities division, and problems regarding its securities renewal in California. Inland American withdrew its request for renewal of its California securities registration after regulators repeatedly raised concerns about conflicts of interest and other issues.[38] Inland American stockholders have been charged over $1.4 Billion in fees by external managers.[39]
Since 2012, Inland American has sold hundreds of assets, resulting in over $4.6 Billion in net proceeds.[40] However, the Trust has so far declined to make any special distributions of those proceeds to shareholders.[41] Instead, it is planning to use the proceeds to buy and develop more properties.[42]
Fees[edit]
The external managers of Residential Properties Trust are compensated through a set of fees charged to investors on a variety of fund transactions. Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.[43] Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors. For example, business management fees[44] and mortgage financing fees[45] reward managers, respectively, for holding onto highly valued (or even overvalued) assets for long periods of time and loading up on mortgage debt.[46]
Another fee, called an acquisition fee, is tied only to the amount of money the Trust pays for real estate.[47] Under this structure, managers do not benefit by trying to negotiate lower prices for acquisitions.[48]
Acquisition fees have been controversial at a sister Inland product, Inland Real Estate Income Trust (Income Trust).[49] Income Trust recently came under fire for its plans to purchase properties that were owned by a different Inland vehicle just months prior.[50] The Wall Street Journal dubbed the transaction a “boomerang buy”. As the Journal reported, “Inland Real Estate Income Trust Inc. said it will pay $318 million for 15 shopping centers owned until earlier this year by one of its sister REITs.”[51] Income Trust planned to charge shareholders a $5 million acquisition fee.[52] The proposed acquisition fee was on top of the portfolio’s $318 million[53] price tag and closing costs.[54] Income Trust admitted that it did not obtain independent appraisals of the properties in the portfolio.[55] On November 5, 2014, Income Trust announced that it agreed to permanently waive the acquisition fee.[56]
Competition for Deals[edit]
Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers all staff or direct one or more other Inland investment vehicles[57] that could compete with the new Trust for deals. They could also face a conflict of interest should one Inland vehicle attempt offload assets to another,[58] like the “boomerang buy” that Income Trust engaged in, as mentioned above.
Mitchell Sabshon, for instance, is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Properties Trust. He is also CEO and Director of Income Trust and a director[59] of Inland Private Capital Corp.[60] Both of these vehicles invest in multifamily products.[61]
Apartment REIT Sector[edit]
Residential Properties Trust is targeting multifamily properties.[62] In February 2015, a mutual fund manager was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’ve got more supply coming into the market than people were hoping, and we’ve had earnings reports that on the whole I’m not thrilled with.” The article noted slower growth and talk of oversupply in the apartment sector.[63]

Inland Residential Properties Trust, Inc. (Residential Properties Trust) is a non-traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sponsored by affiliates of Oak Brook, Illinois-based The Inland Group.[2] The Trust was founded in December 2013 and started selling common stock on February 18, 2015.[3] Residential Properties Trust will invest in stabilized Class A and B multifamily properties in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.[4]
Residential Properties Trust is a non-traded REIT,[5] which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange.[6] The shares therefore have limited or no liquidity.[7]
Residential Properties Trust will be managed by external managers[8] who charge fees or commissions when the Trust buys,[9] holds[10] or sells[11] real estate. External managers for Residential Properties Trust are controlled by affiliates of the Inland Group[12] and charge fees paid to Inland affiliates.[13] In this respect, the Trust’s structure shares similarities with the initial setup of its sister vehicle, Inland American Real Estate Trust (now known as InvenTrust Properties Corporation).[14] Inland American shareholders have been charged $1.4 Billion in related-party fees.[15] A March 2015 Wall Street Journal article described Inland American as a “zombie REIT” noting its failure to unwind, the plunge in value of its holdings, and the drastic cut to shareholder distributions.[16]
All of Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers staff or direct at least one of its external managers,[17] and they also split their time acting as directors or staff of other Inland vehicles.[18] In its SEC filings, the company disclosed that Residential Properties Trust’s officers will have conflicts of interest due to the competing demands for the time they spend between different funds, and that these might lead to them violating their fiduciary duties. The SEC filings further acknowledge that the Trust’s external managers will face conflicts of interest because of their compensation arrangements.[19] Such actions could include purchasing assets that are not in shareholders’ best interests, or negotiating higher purchase prices for assets than they otherwise would if they were not compensated based on the purchase price, among other things.[20]

Fund Management[edit]
In contrast to most publicly-traded REITs, Residential Properties Trust relies completely on external managers.[21] It has no paid staff, and is managed by five executive officers who all staff or direct one or more of the Trust’s fee-based external advisors.[22] The external advisors are owned by The Inland Group,[23] and extract fees or commissions when Residential Properties Trust buys, holds or sells real estate. Due to this setup, the fund has inherent conflicts of interest.[24]
The external advisors are tasked with running the business of the Trust, including: selecting potential real estate investments,[25] negotiating contracts, managing properties[26] and advising the board of directors on asset acquisitions and sales, among other things.[27] In return, they will earn fees through schedules laid out in agreements[28] with Residential Properties Trust. The contracts were not negotiated at arm’s-length.[29]
For example, Mitchell Sabshon is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Property Trust. He is also the President and CEO of Residential Property Trust’s business manager[30] and a director of the Trust’s dealer manager.[31] The business manager receives acquisition fees,[32] real estate sales commissions,[33] and a host of other fees[34] for its activities. The dealer manager receives commissions and fees on every share investors buy.[35]
Residential Properties Trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of Inland American.[36] At Inland American, related-party transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. These include a finding of breach of fiduciary duty by Inland American’s Special Litigation Committee,[37] a subpoena by the Illinois securities division, and problems regarding its securities renewal in California. Inland American withdrew its request for renewal of its California securities registration after regulators repeatedly raised concerns about conflicts of interest and other issues.[38] Inland American stockholders have been charged over $1.4 Billion in fees by external managers.[39]
Since 2012, Inland American has sold hundreds of assets, resulting in over $4.6 Billion in net proceeds.[40] However, the Trust has so far declined to make any special distributions of those proceeds to shareholders.[41] Instead, it is planning to use the proceeds to buy and develop more properties.[42]
Fees[edit]
The external managers of Residential Properties Trust are compensated through a set of fees charged to investors on a variety of fund transactions. Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.[43] Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors. For example, business management fees[44] and mortgage financing fees[45] reward managers, respectively, for holding onto highly valued (or even overvalued) assets for long periods of time and loading up on mortgage debt.[46]
Another fee, called an acquisition fee, is tied only to the amount of money the Trust pays for real estate.[47] Under this structure, managers do not benefit by trying to negotiate lower prices for acquisitions.[48]
Acquisition fees have been controversial at a sister Inland product, Inland Real Estate Income Trust (Income Trust).[49] Income Trust recently came under fire for its plans to purchase properties that were owned by a different Inland vehicle just months prior.[50] The Wall Street Journal dubbed the transaction a “boomerang buy”. As the Journal reported, “Inland Real Estate Income Trust Inc. said it will pay $318 million for 15 shopping centers owned until earlier this year by one of its sister REITs.”[51] Income Trust planned to charge shareholders a $5 million acquisition fee.[52] The proposed acquisition fee was on top of the portfolio’s $318 million[53] price tag and closing costs.[54] Income Trust admitted that it did not obtain independent appraisals of the properties in the portfolio.[55] On November 5, 2014, Income Trust announced that it agreed to permanently waive the acquisition fee.[56]
Competition for Deals[edit]
Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers all staff or direct one or more other Inland investment vehicles[57] that could compete with the new Trust for deals. They could also face a conflict of interest should one Inland vehicle attempt offload assets to another,[58] like the “boomerang buy” that Income Trust engaged in, as mentioned above.
Mitchell Sabshon, for instance, is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Properties Trust. He is also CEO and Director of Income Trust and a director[59] of Inland Private Capital Corp.[60] Both of these vehicles invest in multifamily products.[61]
Apartment REIT Sector[edit]
Residential Properties Trust is targeting multifamily properties.[62] In February 2015, a mutual fund manager was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’ve got more supply coming into the market than people were hoping, and we’ve had earnings reports that on the whole I’m not thrilled with.” The article noted slower growth and talk of oversupply in the apartment sector.[63]

Inland Residential Properties Trust, Inc.


Type

Real estate investment trust


Industry
Commercial Real Estate


Founded

Headquarters

Website
http://inland-investments.com/InlandResidentialTrust/


Inland Residential Properties Trust, Inc. (Residential Properties Trust) is a non-traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sponsored by affiliates of Oak Brook, Illinois-based The Inland Group.[2] The Trust was founded in December 2013 and started selling common stock on February 18, 2015.[3] Residential Properties Trust will invest in stabilized Class A and B multifamily properties in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.[4]
Residential Properties Trust is a non-traded REIT,[5] which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange.[6] The shares therefore have limited or no liquidity.[7]
Residential Properties Trust will be managed by external managers[8] who charge fees or commissions when the Trust buys,[9] holds[10] or sells[11] real estate. External managers for Residential Properties Trust are controlled by affiliates of the Inland Group[12] and charge fees paid to Inland affiliates.[13] In this respect, the Trust’s structure shares similarities with the initial setup of its sister vehicle, Inland American Real Estate Trust (now known as InvenTrust Properties Corporation).[14] Inland American shareholders have been charged $1.4 Billion in related-party fees.[15] A March 2015 Wall Street Journal article described Inland American as a “zombie REIT” noting its failure to unwind, the plunge in value of its holdings, and the drastic cut to shareholder distributions.[16]
All of Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers staff or direct at least one of its external managers,[17] and they also split their time acting as directors or staff of other Inland vehicles.[18] In its SEC filings, the company disclosed that Residential Properties Trust’s officers will have conflicts of interest due to the competing demands for the time they spend between different funds, and that these might lead to them violating their fiduciary duties. The SEC filings further acknowledge that the Trust’s external managers will face conflicts of interest because of their compensation arrangements.[19] Such actions could include purchasing assets that are not in shareholders’ best interests, or negotiating higher purchase prices for assets than they otherwise would if they were not compensated based on the purchase price, among other things.[20]

Fund Management[edit]
In contrast to most publicly-traded REITs, Residential Properties Trust relies completely on external managers.[21] It has no paid staff, and is managed by five executive officers who all staff or direct one or more of the Trust’s fee-based external advisors.[22] The external advisors are owned by The Inland Group,[23] and extract fees or commissions when Residential Properties Trust buys, holds or sells real estate. Due to this setup, the fund has inherent conflicts of interest.[24]
The external advisors are tasked with running the business of the Trust, including: selecting potential real estate investments,[25] negotiating contracts, managing properties[26] and advising the board of directors on asset acquisitions and sales, among other things.[27] In return, they will earn fees through schedules laid out in agreements[28] with Residential Properties Trust. The contracts were not negotiated at arm’s-length.[29]
For example, Mitchell Sabshon is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Property Trust. He is also the President and CEO of Residential Property Trust’s business manager[30] and a director of the Trust’s dealer manager.[31] The business manager receives acquisition fees,[32] real estate sales commissions,[33] and a host of other fees[34] for its activities. The dealer manager receives commissions and fees on every share investors buy.[35]
Residential Properties Trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of Inland American.[36] At Inland American, related-party transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. These include a finding of breach of fiduciary duty by Inland American’s Special Litigation Committee,[37] a subpoena by the Illinois securities division, and problems regarding its securities renewal in California. Inland American withdrew its request for renewal of its California securities registration after regulators repeatedly raised concerns about conflicts of interest and other issues.[38] Inland American stockholders have been charged over $1.4 Billion in fees by external managers.[39]
Since 2012, Inland American has sold hundreds of assets, resulting in over $4.6 Billion in net proceeds.[40] However, the Trust has so far declined to make any special distributions of those proceeds to shareholders.[41] Instead, it is planning to use the proceeds to buy and develop more properties.[42]
Fees[edit]
The external managers of Residential Properties Trust are compensated through a set of fees charged to investors on a variety of fund transactions. Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.[43] Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors. For example, business management fees[44] and mortgage financing fees[45] reward managers, respectively, for holding onto highly valued (or even overvalued) assets for long periods of time and loading up on mortgage debt.[46]
Another fee, called an acquisition fee, is tied only to the amount of money the Trust pays for real estate.[47] Under this structure, managers do not benefit by trying to negotiate lower prices for acquisitions.[48]
Acquisition fees have been controversial at a sister Inland product, Inland Real Estate Income Trust (Income Trust).[49] Income Trust recently came under fire for its plans to purchase properties that were owned by a different Inland vehicle just months prior.[50] The Wall Street Journal dubbed the transaction a “boomerang buy”. As the Journal reported, “Inland Real Estate Income Trust Inc. said it will pay $318 million for 15 shopping centers owned until earlier this year by one of its sister REITs.”[51] Income Trust planned to charge shareholders a $5 million acquisition fee.[52] The proposed acquisition fee was on top of the portfolio’s $318 million[53] price tag and closing costs.[54] Income Trust admitted that it did not obtain independent appraisals of the properties in the portfolio.[55] On November 5, 2014, Income Trust announced that it agreed to permanently waive the acquisition fee.[56]
Competition for Deals[edit]
Residential Properties Trust’s executive officers all staff or direct one or more other Inland investment vehicles[57] that could compete with the new Trust for deals. They could also face a conflict of interest should one Inland vehicle attempt offload assets to another,[58] like the “boomerang buy” that Income Trust engaged in, as mentioned above.
Mitchell Sabshon, for instance, is the CEO, President and a Director of Residential Properties Trust. He is also CEO and Director of Income Trust and a director[59] of Inland Private Capital Corp.[60] Both of these vehicles invest in multifamily products.[61]
Apartment REIT Sector[edit]
Residential Properties Trust is targeting multifamily properties.[62] In February 2015, a mutual fund manager was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’ve got more supply coming into the market than people were hoping, and we’ve had earnings reports that on the whole I’m not thrilled with.” The article noted slower growth and talk of oversupply in the apartment sector.[63]

Inland American – SEC Probe – Salas Wang Investigation
May 11, 2012


The Wall Street is reporting that the SEC is investigating Inland American Non-Traded REIT.  Our firm has been investigating shareholder claims against brokers who sold shares to investors for sometime.  This recent SEC action, we believe, is the culmination of years of abuse.  According to the WSJ:
The SEC is looking at activity of Inland American Real Estate Trust to determine if the REIT committed violations related to management fees, the timing and amount of distributions paid to investors, and transactions with affiliates, according to a company filing with the SEC on Monday.
If you own shares of Inland American, please call Jeffrey Salas at 312.803.4963 or fill out the contact form below.

Inland American – SEC Probe – Salas Wang Investigation
May 11, 2012


The Wall Street is reporting that the SEC is investigating Inland American Non-Traded REIT.  Our firm has been investigating shareholder claims against brokers who sold shares to investors for sometime.  This recent SEC action, we believe, is the culmination of years of abuse.  According to the WSJ:
The SEC is looking at activity of Inland American Real Estate Trust to determine if the REIT committed violations related to management fees, the timing and amount of distributions paid to investors, and transactions with affiliates, according to a company filing with the SEC on Monday.
If you own shares of Inland American, please call Jeffrey Salas at 312.803.4963 or fill out the contact form below.

Inland plans to raise $1 billion for apartment company


The Inland Group Inc. is rolling out another real estate investment trust, filing plans last week to raise $1 billion for a new company that would buy apartments in major U.S. metropolitan areas.The company, Inland Residential Properties Trust Inc., would be the seventh REIT launched by Inland Group, an Oak Brook-based company founded by four school teachers in the late 1960s that has grown into one of the biggest real estate investment firms headquartered in the Chicago area. Inland specializes in non-traded REITs, public companies whose shares are not listed on a stock exchange. Instead of accumulating a portfolio of properties and then going public, non-traded REITs are “blind pool” investments, usually launching stock offerings before buying a single asset. Unlike traded REITs, which sell their stock in a single day, they raise money over time, sometimes taking several years before closing an offering.COUNTING ON HIGH DEMANDInland Residential plans to buy Class A and Class B multifamily properties in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Like many apartment investors, Inland Residential is counting on strong demand for apartments from baby boomers and millennials.“Demographic studies suggest that baby boomers are downsizing their suburban homes and relocating to multifamily units located in urban cultural centers,” the company said in the filing. “Millennials are renting multifamily units because they generally have a high level of student debt and credit standards for mortgage loans have increased, both of which hinder millennials from buying traditional single-family detached houses.”Inland Group declined to comment, citing federal law that limits what companies can say ahead of stock offerings.Inland Group was the top fundraiser in the non-traded REIT industry during the boom. Its REITs and other Inland investment vehicles raked in more than $18.3 billion in the 10-year period ended June 30, according to the filing.Yet the company fell off its perch after the crash amid increased competition and struggles at two of its REITs, Retail Properties of America Inc. and Inland American Real Estate Trust Inc. Its sixth REIT, Inland Real Estate Income Trust, launched about two years ago, had raised just $262.2 million through Sept. 15, according to the SEC filing, a small amount compared with other non-traded REITs. The classes of multifamily properties Inland Residential plans to buy has been corrected.
