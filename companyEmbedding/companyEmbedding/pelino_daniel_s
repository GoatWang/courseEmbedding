TESTIMONIAL:


When we were preparing to bid office supplies, our campuses began emailing me explaining why Daniel's is so good and why we couldn't go with another company.
I put on my objective hat and said, "Customer service is important, but so is pricing." I knew that we were going with the best value to the district regardless of who that was. Daniel's pricing was outstanding and we awarded them an exclusive contract for office supplies.
Daniel's is one of our most responsive vendors.  If we want it, they usually figure out a way to do it.  Their prices are excellent and their customer service is superb.
Here's one example of their above-and-beyond service.  One of our campuses ordered the wrong printer cartridge for a training session the next day. They called Daniel's and explained the situation. It was clearly our fault. However, the owner (not a sales person or a delivery driver) drove out to the school immediately with the correct cartridge. That kind of service is hard to find. 

- Martin T Kennedy
