			Mr. Palmer is a life-long resident of Jacksonville, Florida. He has been employed by the Mayo Clinic for the past 24 years. He currently serves as an Operations Administrator for the Provider Relation Departments. He previously served as the Operations Manager for Primary Care, the Director and Section Head of Patient Financial Services and as Section Manager of Accounts Receivable. Mr. Palmer is active in a number of Jacksonville area civic organizations, which provide an opportunity for the community to learn more about Atlantic Coast Bank and its products and services. Mr. Palmer was associated with Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union as a member of its Credit Union Service Organization and its Community Advisory Board. In those roles, Mr. Palmer interacted with members and member organizations and helped identify business development opportunities. Originally, Mr. Palmer was nominated as a director in order to use his previous experience and familiarity with the Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union members to assist management in the transition from a credit union to a publicly traded bank holding company. Mr. Palmer also brings to our Board of Directors and organization knowledge and insight about our Northeast Florida markets through his involvement in Jacksonville civic organizations which is useful to Atlantic Coast Bank's product design and marketing plans.
