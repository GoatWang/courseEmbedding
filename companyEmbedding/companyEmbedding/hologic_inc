Gynecologic surgery








 At Hologic, we believe all women deserve to be free of debilitating gynecologic conditions that can rob them from enjoying life to its fullest. Delivering innovative, simple and efficient gynecologic surgical products that address these conditions is an important part of our mission.
In 2002, we introduced the first of these products – the NovaSure endometrial ablation system – for the rapid and effective treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. To date, more than 2 million NovaSure procedures have been performed worldwide. For more than 90% of women undergoing this procedure, menstrual bleeding is dramatically reduced or eliminated altogether.
We continue to expand our family of GYN surgical products, offering a wide range of customized solutions that can help you dramatically improve the lives of your patients. One of the newest additions is the MyoSure tissue removal system, which enables you to quickly and conveniently remove intrauterine pathology under direct visualization. Together, we are reshaping the future of gynecologic health, so that patients no longer need to suffer in silence or alter their activities to accommodate emotionally stressful, painful – even life-altering – gynecologic medical conditions.

Hologic (HOLX) Product Pipeline Strong, Competition Rife


June 28, 2017, 08:55:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 On Jun 27, we issued an updated research report on Hologic, Inc. HOLX  , headquartered in Bedford, MA. The company manufactures mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment. Hologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past one year, Hologic has been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Instruments  industry. The company has gained 33.7%, when compared to the 15.3% gain of the broader industry. We are encouraged to note that the company is constantly making efforts to expand its business. Hologic recently announced the receipt of FDA clearance to market the Aptima Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 & 2 molecular assay on the fully automated Panther system.    Also, the company announced that the U.S. FDA has granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure's non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, to treat the back as well as inner and outer thighs. In February, Hologic launched a next-generation NovaSure ADVANCED product in the U.S. for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. Further, the company announced FDA approvals for two important new diagnostic assays. These are viral load tests for HIV-1 and the hepatitis C virus. Hologic also announced that its Aptima Zika Virus diagnostic assay received CE mark in Europe for the detection and diagnosis of the Zika virus in patients. Management also continues to expect U.S. regulatory clearance for its hepatitis B assay in 2018. The company's strong product pipeline is also encouraging. In this regard, Hologic is working on innovation and product launches. At Diagnostics, it recently filed for regulatory approval of its Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the U.S. and anticipates the product launch in 2017, following the introduction of its HIV viral load assay. Under the breast health segment, Hologic has focused its R&D strategy on continuous innovation to fortify its leadership position in 3D mammography. Meanwhile, the Affirm prone biopsy system and upcoming Brevera products are likely to provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and patient experience. This apart, the company acquired Medicor, its long-time distributor of breast and skeletal health products in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This opens up considerable scope for the company and also helps it to gain direct access to customers. Moreover, the Medicare payment rates, which came into effect on Jan 1, 2015, will allow providers in the U.S. to determine coverage policies specific to screening and diagnostic 3D mammography. Management expects the new Medicare payment rates to allow more women to gain access to this 3D screening test, which is the only one approved by the FDA as clinically superior to standard mammography. We believe the availability of reimbursement for 3D mammography coupled with the substantial body of published studies, which showed positive results in favor of the 3D test, will boost demand for the same. On the flip side, foreign exchange headwinds continue to affect the company's international performance. Hologic operates in a highly competitive industry. Its mammography, related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by the likes of General Electric Company (GE), Siemens, Koninklijke Philips NV, or Philips, FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, or Fuji, I.M.S., and Toshiba Corporation, to name a few.  Key Picks  A few better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. ALGN  , Inogen, Inc. INGN  and Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. AXDX  . Notably, Inogen sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology and Accelerate Diagnostics carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock has added roughly 30.7% over the last three months. Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock has gained around 19.7% over the last three months. Accelerate Diagnostics has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of 30%. The stock has added roughly 17.9% over the last three months.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Hologic, Inc. is a developer, manufacturer and supplier of diagnostic products, medical imaging systems and surgical products. The Company’s core business units focus on diagnostics, breast health, gynecological surgical, and skeletal health. Its major products include the Selenia Dimension mammography system, the Discovery and Horizon bone densitometers, the NovaSure endometrial ablation device, the ThinPrep pap test, and the Aptima, Cervista, and Prodesse diagnostic assays. While historically the Company was focused on women's health, expansion into the molecular diagnostics space has resulted in the Company's rebranding from "The Women's Health Company" to its current tagline, "The Science of Sure".

Recent Mergers and Acquisitions[edit]
On May 20, 2007, Hologic announced a merger (via a cash and stock transaction) with the Cytyc Corporation to create a $10 billion women's healthcare company with over $1 billion in projected annual sales.[1]
On April 30, 2012, Hologic announced a merger with Gen-Probe for about $3.72 billion by cash.
On February 14, 2017, it was announced that Hologic had acquired Cynosure, Inc., a leading manufacturer and distributor of aesthetic medical devices. The transaction was completed on March 22, 2017.[2]
Infiltration by Carl Icahn[edit]
In late November 2013, activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a 12.5% stake in the company. Subsequently, the company adopted a poison pill to prevent a hostile takeover. In negotiations with the Company's board of directors, two additional directors backed by Mr. Icahn were added to the board, each managing directors of Icahn holding companies.[3] The directors relinquished their positions in March 2016; by April 2016, Icahn's share in the Company had fallen below 5%.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Hologic, Inc. is a developer, manufacturer and supplier of diagnostic products, medical imaging systems and surgical products. The Company’s core business units focus on diagnostics, breast health, gynecological surgical, and skeletal health. Its major products include the Selenia Dimension mammography system, the Discovery and Horizon bone densitometers, the NovaSure endometrial ablation device, the ThinPrep pap test, and the Aptima, Cervista, and Prodesse diagnostic assays. While historically the Company was focused on women's health, expansion into the molecular diagnostics space has resulted in the Company's rebranding from "The Women's Health Company" to its current tagline, "The Science of Sure".

Recent Mergers and Acquisitions[edit]
On May 20, 2007, Hologic announced a merger (via a cash and stock transaction) with the Cytyc Corporation to create a $10 billion women's healthcare company with over $1 billion in projected annual sales.[1]
On April 30, 2012, Hologic announced a merger with Gen-Probe for about $3.72 billion by cash.
On February 14, 2017, it was announced that Hologic had acquired Cynosure, Inc., a leading manufacturer and distributor of aesthetic medical devices. The transaction was completed on March 22, 2017.[2]
Infiltration by Carl Icahn[edit]
In late November 2013, activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a 12.5% stake in the company. Subsequently, the company adopted a poison pill to prevent a hostile takeover. In negotiations with the Company's board of directors, two additional directors backed by Mr. Icahn were added to the board, each managing directors of Icahn holding companies.[3] The directors relinquished their positions in March 2016; by April 2016, Icahn's share in the Company had fallen below 5%.[4]

Read MoreHide Full Article









On Jun 27, we issued an updated research report on Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report)	, headquartered in Bedford, MA. The company manufactures mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment. Hologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past one year, Hologic has been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Instruments industry. The company has gained 33.7%, when compared to the 15.3% gain of the broader industry.We are encouraged to note that the company is constantly making efforts to expand its business. Hologic recently announced the receipt of FDA clearance to market the Aptima Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 & 2 molecular assay on the fully automated Panther system.Also, the company announced that the U.S. FDA has granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure's non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, to treat the back as well as inner and outer thighs.In February, Hologic launched a next-generation NovaSure ADVANCED product in the U.S. for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. Further, the company announced FDA approvals for two important new diagnostic assays. These are viral load tests for HIV-1 and the hepatitis C virus. Hologic also announced that its Aptima Zika Virus diagnostic assay received CE mark in Europe for the detection and diagnosis of the Zika virus in patients. Management also continues to expect U.S. regulatory clearance for its hepatitis B assay in 2018.The company’s strong product pipeline is also encouraging. In this regard, Hologic is working on innovation and product launches. At Diagnostics, it recently filed for regulatory approval of its Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the U.S. and anticipates the product launch in 2017, following the introduction of its HIV viral load assay. Under the breast health segment, Hologic has focused its R&D strategy on continuous innovation to fortify its leadership position in 3D mammography. Meanwhile, the Affirm prone biopsy system and upcoming Brevera products are likely to provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and patient experience.This apart, the company acquired Medicor, its long-time distributor of breast and skeletal health products in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This opens up considerable scope for the company and also helps it to gain direct access to customers.Moreover, the Medicare payment rates, which came into effect on Jan 1, 2015, will allow providers in the U.S. to determine coverage policies specific to screening and diagnostic 3D mammography. Management expects the new Medicare payment rates to allow more women to gain access to this 3D screening test, which is the only one approved by the FDA as clinically superior to standard mammography. We believe the availability of reimbursement for 3D mammography coupled with the substantial body of published studies, which showed positive results in favor of the 3D test, will boost demand for the same.On the flip side, foreign exchange headwinds continue to affect the company’s international performance. Hologic operates in a highly competitive industry. Its mammography, related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by the likes of General Electric Company (GE), Siemens, Koninklijke Philips NV, or Philips, FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, or Fuji, I.M.S., and Toshiba Corporation, to name a few.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report)	, Inogen, Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report)	 and Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. (AXDX  -  Free Report)	. Notably, Inogen sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology and Accelerate Diagnostics carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock has added roughly 30.7% over the last three months.Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock has gained around 19.7% over the last three months.Accelerate Diagnostics has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of 30%. The stock has added roughly 17.9% over the last three months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies   It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
