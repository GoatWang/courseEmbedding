					Full Description



Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc., incorporated on November 25, 2009, manufactures, sells and services a range of specialty electrical transmission, distribution and on-site power generation equipment for applications in the utility, industrial, commercial and backup power markets. The Company operates through two segments: Transmission & Distribution Solutions (T&D Solutions) and Critical Power Solutions (Critical Power). Its T&D Solutions business provides equipment solutions that help customers manage their electrical power distribution systems to desired specifications. The T&D Solutions segment consists of two primary product categories: electrical transformers and switchgear. These solutions are marketed principally through its Pioneer Transformers Ltd., Jefferson Electric, Inc. and Pioneer CEP brand names. Its Critical Power business provides customers with power generation equipment, paralleling switchgear, related electrical distribution infrastructure, and a data collection and monitoring platform. The Critical Power segment consists of two primary product categories and one main service category: engine-generator sets, switchgear and controls, and preventative maintenance and monitoring services. These solutions are marketed by its operations in Minneapolis, doing business under the Pioneer Critical Power Inc. and Titan Energy Systems Inc. (Titan) brand names.The Company's principal products and services include custom-engineered electrical transformers, switchgear and engine-generator sets and controls, complemented by a national field-service network to maintain and repair power generation assets. It operates from over 10 additional locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico for manufacturing, service, centralized distribution, engineering, sales and administration. Its customers include national and regional utilities, industrial companies and engineering, procurement and construction firms, which are located in North America. In addition, the Company sells its products through various electrical distributors served by its network of stocking locations throughout the United States and Canada.Transmission & Distribution Solutions SegmentThe Company designs, develops, manufactures and sells a range of electrical transmission and distribution equipment. The Company serves customers in a range of industries, including electric utilities, industrial customers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), commercial firms, contractors and renewable energy producers. Its liquid-filled and dry-type power, distribution and specialty electrical transformers are magnetic products used in the control and conditioning of electrical current for critical processes. The Company manufactures liquid-filled transformers at its facility in Granby, Quebec. Liquid-filled transformers are used for applications handling utility or industrial-level electrical loads, such as in a substation, and are found in outdoor settings given the risk of leakage and the flammable properties of the liquid coolant, typically mineral oil. The Company manufactures these products in electrical power ranges from 25-kilovolt amperes (kVA) to 30 megavolt amperes (MVA) and at over 69 kilovolts (kV) in voltage.The Company sells these products to electrical utilities, independent power providers, electrical co-ops, industrial companies, commercial users and electric equipment wholesalers. The Company manufactures dry-type transformers and custom magnetics at its facilities in Farnham, Quebec and Reynosa, Mexico. The Company also offers an array of magnetically-driven solutions to eliminate issues caused by harmonics and transients, including solutions that incorporate its technology through the use of power electronics. Its principal product categories include low voltage electric power distribution panel boards, switchboards and switchgear manufactured at its facility in Southern California.Critical Power Solutions SegmentThe Critical Power segment is engaged in designing, manufacturing, selling, commissioning and aftermarket service of onsite power generation and control equipment. In addition, its Critical Power business specializes in customized equipment and controls for complex primary power applications, enabling on-site users to parallel multiple power sources with the utility power grid, in combined heat, power and cooling applications, and for peak shaving and demand/load side management of electrical power. The Company provides its industrial and commercial customers with a range of power generation equipment and fuel options, which depending on their needs and applications, can range from several kilowatts to 2 megawatts of output per engine generator. The Company also offers solutions, such as GenMax, its harmonic suppression technology that resolves power reliability and genset capacity issues. Its Critical Power segment designs and manufactures paralleling switchgear (PSG), automatic transfer switches (ATSs) and provides other equipment. Its power maintenance programs provide preventative maintenance, repair and support service for its customers' power generation systems.The Company competes with ABB Ltd., Carte International, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, General Electric Company, Schneider Electric SA, Hammond Power Solutions Inc., Howard Industries, Inc., Partner Technologies, Inc., Caterpillar, Cummins, Kohler, Emerson Electric Company, GE Zenith, IEM Power Systems, Inc., Regal Beloit Corporation and Russelectric Inc.
