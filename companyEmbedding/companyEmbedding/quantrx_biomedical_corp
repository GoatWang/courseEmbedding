The Company's platforms include inSync, Unique, PadKit, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) branded over-the-counter and laboratory testing products based on the Company's PAD technology. The Company's PAD products are based on the Company's non-woven disposable absorbent pad technology, with products for aiding the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, the over-the-counter catamenial markets, and other medical needs, including diagnostic sampling products, which enable self-collection and around the world transport for indications, such as various cancers, premature delivery, and genomic testing.The Company's subsidiary QX Labs, Inc.'s diagnostic testing business (Diagnostic Business) is based its PadKit technology, which provides platform technology for genomic diagnostics, including fetal genomics. The Company's business line consists of its over-the-counter (OTC) business, including the the InSync feminine hygienic interlabial pad, the Unique Miniform for hemorrhoid application, and other treated miniforms (the OTC Business), as well as established and continuing licensing relationships related to the OTC Business.PADs for Diagnosis and TreatmentThe Company's miniform PAD is the Company's technology that provides the basis for a line of products for an array of consumer health issues, including temporary relief of hemorrhoid and minor vaginal infection itch and discomfort, feminine urinary incontinence, catamenial needs, drug delivery and medical sample collection and transport for diagnostic testing. The Company's PAD products for the consumer markets are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Class I OTC devices and are biodegradable and absorbent pads. Additionally, the non-woven technology utilized for the PADs allows a PAD to be used as a sample collection device, providing a sample for diagnostic purposes, or to provide local or systemic therapy.PADKitThe Company's PADKit integrates the Company's miniform technology with its diagnostic expertise. The PADKit contains a miniform used as a collection device to collect samples for diagnostic evaluation. Vaginally, the miniform collects blood along with numerous cells, vaginal mucous and discharge flushed out by the menstrual flow or during normal daily exfoliation. The PADKit is designed to provide the preferred sample collection system for use in population scale testing of indications, such as Human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and general health screenings.Unique MiniformsThe Company's Miniform is a flushable technology for the underserved OTC hemorrhoid, feminine hygiene and urinary incontinence markets. The disposable miniform pad contains no adhesives, requires no insertion, and is small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. The Unique miniform is available as a treated pad for the temporary relief of the itch and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids and minor vaginal infection, and as an untreated pad, for the daily protection of light urinary, vaginal or anal leakage.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
