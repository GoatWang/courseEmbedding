John Pierpont Morgan (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier and banker who dominated corporate finance and industrial consolidation in late 19th and early 20th Century United States.
In 1892, Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. He was also instrumental in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation, International Harvester and AT&T. At the height of Morgan's career during the early 1900s, he and his partners had financial investments in many large corporations and had significant influence over the nation's high finance and United States Congress members. He directed the banking coalition that stopped the Panic of 1907. He was the leading financier of the Progressive Era, and his dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform American business. Morgan has been described as America’s greatest banker.[1]
Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan, Jr. His fortune was estimated at "only" US$80 million, prompting John D. Rockefeller to say: "and to think, he wasn't even a rich man".

Childhood and education[edit]
Morgan was born into the influential Morgan family in Hartford, Connecticut, and was raised there. He was the son of Junius Spencer Morgan (1813–1890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884).[2][3] Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to the plans of his father. In the fall of 1848, Pierpont transferred to the Hartford Public School and then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut (now called Cheshire Academy), boarding with the principal. In September 1851, Morgan passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, a school specializing in mathematics to prepare young men for careers in commerce. In the spring of 1852, an illness struck which was to become more common as his life progressed. Rheumatic fever left him in so much pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.[4]
He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to the English High School in Boston to resume his studies. After he graduated, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school near the Swiss village of Vevey, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of Göttingen in order to improve his German. He attained a passable level of German within six months and also a degree in art history, then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, with his formal education complete.[5]
Career[edit]
Early years and life[edit]
Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan & Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at $3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for $22 each.[6][7][8][9] Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute $300 to take his place.[6] From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed "J.S. Morgan & Co." upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864–72, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, he partnered with the Drexels of Philadelphia to form the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan & Company. At that time, Anthony J. Drexel became Pierpont's mentor at the request of Junius Morgan.[10]
J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]
Main article: J.P. Morgan & Co.
After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened "J. P. Morgan & Company" in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel & Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes & Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan & Company (after 1910 Morgan, Grenfell & Company) of London. By 1900, it was one of the most powerful banking houses of the world, focused especially on reorganizations and consolidations.[citation needed]
Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge.[11] His process of taking over troubled businesses to reorganize them became known as "Morganization".[12] Morgan reorganized business structures and management in order to return them to profitability. His reputation as a banker and financier also helped bring interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.[13]
Treasury gold[edit]
The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces,[14] to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue.[15] The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.[16]
Newspapers[edit]
In 1896, Adolph Simon Ochs owned the Chattanooga Times, and he secured financing from Morgan to purchase the financially struggling New York Times.[17]
Steel[edit]




J. P. Morgan in his earlier years


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan & Co. (which was renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900. The goal was to buy out Carnegie's steel business and merge it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he finally merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses (including Consolidated Steel and Wire Company, owned by William Edenborn), to form the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901 U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in the world, having an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion, which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads.
U.S. Steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution.[18] It was also planned to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed that U.S. Steel's size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets ("globalization").[18] U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and a host of other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan had captured two-thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 percent market share.[18] However, after 1901 the business' market share dropped. Schwab resigned from U.S. Steel in 1903 to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer.
Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union "troublemakers." The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a "paternalistic" labor policy. (U.S. Steel was eventually unionized in the late 1930s.)[19]
Panic of 1907[edit]




Morgan's role in the economy was denounced as overpowering in this political cartoon


The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis.[20][21] Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked $35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks.[22] Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.[20]
A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over $6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel and he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid $30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.[20]
Vowing to never let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.[23]
Banking's critics[edit]




"I Like a Little Competition"—J. P. Morgan by Art Young. Cartoon relating to the answer Morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the Pujo Committee.[24]


While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected.[25] Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.[26]
Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan & Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of $22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River.[27]
Unsuccessful ventures[edit]
Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.
Tesla[edit]
In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans-Atlantic wireless communication system (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla $150,000 (equivalent to $4,318,200 in 2016) to build the system in return for a 51% control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system.[28] Morgan considered Tesla's changes, and requests for the additional amounts of money to build it, a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.[28][29]
London Subways[edit]
Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to enter the London Underground field. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with "Tube" lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup "the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of".[30]
International Mercantile Marine[edit]
In 1902, J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company (IMMC), an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over-leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re-emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.[31][32]
Morgan corporations[edit]
From 1890–1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.[33]

Later years[edit]




J. P. Morgan, photographed by Edward Steichen in 1903


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan gained control of J. S. Morgan & Co (renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began conversations with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900 with the intention of buying Carnegie's business and several other steel and iron businesses to consolidate them to create the United States Steel Corporation.[18] Carnegie agreed to sell the business to Morgan for $480 million.[18][34] The deal was closed without lawyers and without a written contract. News of the industrial consolidation arrived to newspapers in mid-January 1901. U.S. Steel was founded later that year and was the first billion-dollar company in the world with an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion.[35]
Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black-balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York.[36] He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of $125,000, and commanded Stanford White to "...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense..."[citation needed] He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi (1835–1862). She died the following year. He married Frances Louisa Tracy, known as Fanny (1842–1924), on May 31, 1865. They had four children:

Louisa Pierpont Morgan (1866–1946) who married Herbert L. Satterlee; (1863–1947)[38]
J. P. Morgan, Jr. (1867–1943) who married Jane Norton Grew;
Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1870–1952) who married William Pierson Hamilton (1869–1950);
Anne Tracy Morgan (1873–1952), philanthropist.

Appearance[edit]




Self-conscious about his rosacea, Morgan hated being photographed


Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling "as if a gale had blown through the house."[39] Morgan was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose (because of a chronic skin disease, rosacea).[40] He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed; as a result of his self-consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched.[citation needed] His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt "Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue."[41] Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child Morgan suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son-in-law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.[42] His social and professional self-confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.[43] Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.[44]
Religion[edit]
Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders.[45] He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan.[46] In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their “faith and order.” Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed $100,000 to finance the commission’s work.[47]
Homes[edit]

His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882.[48] It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878.[49] It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned East Island in Glen Cove, New York, where he had a large summer house.
Yachting[edit]

An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts. The well-known quote, "If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it" is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed.[50] A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930.
Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix-les-Bains, France.[51] The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said, "Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death."[52]
Collector[edit]
Morgan was a notable collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (of which he was president and was a major force in its establishment), and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.[53] Morgan was painted by many artists including the Peruvian Carlos Baca-Flor and the Swiss-born American Adolfo Müller-Ury, who also painted a double portrait of Morgan with his favorite grandchild, Mabel Satterlee, that for some years stood on an easel in the Satterlee mansion but has now disappeared.[citation needed]
Benefactor[edit]
Morgan was a benefactor of the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Groton School, Harvard University (especially its medical school), Trinity College, the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.
Gem collector[edit]




U.S. gemstones from the Morgan collection


By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones (over 1,000 pieces). Tiffany & Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.[54]
George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York where they were known as the Morgan-Tiffany and the Morgan-Bement collections.[55] In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer, morganite.
Photography[edit]
Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis $75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians.[56] Curtis eventually published a 20-volume work entitled The North American Indian.[57] Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters (1914), which was restored in 1974 and re-released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.[58]
Death[edit]




The J.P. Morgan Library and Art Museum


Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel in Rome, Italy. Flags on Wall Street flew at half-staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City.[59] His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont "Jack" Morgan, Jr., inherited the banking business.[60] He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
His estate was worth $68.3 million ($1.39 billion in today's dollars based on CPI, or $25.2 billion based on share of GDP), of which about $30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at $50 million.[61]

Legacy[edit]
His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act, the "House of Morgan" became three entities: J.P. Morgan & Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house.
The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.[62]
The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston (at Highlands, New York), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[63]
Popular culture[edit]

A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy.
Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist,[64] in E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime,[65] and in Steven S. Drachman's novel, The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh.[66]
Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher (played by George Coulouris), guardian of the young Citizen Kane (film directed by Orson Welles) with whom he has a tense relationship—Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood.[67]
According to Phil Orbanes, former Vice President of Parker Brothers, Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.[68]
Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America.[69]
My Name Is Morgan (But It Ain't J.P.) - 1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Original released as a "coon song" but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.[70][71][72]

John Pierpont Morgan (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier and banker who dominated corporate finance and industrial consolidation in late 19th and early 20th Century United States.
In 1892, Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. He was also instrumental in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation, International Harvester and AT&T. At the height of Morgan's career during the early 1900s, he and his partners had financial investments in many large corporations and had significant influence over the nation's high finance and United States Congress members. He directed the banking coalition that stopped the Panic of 1907. He was the leading financier of the Progressive Era, and his dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform American business. Morgan has been described as America’s greatest banker.[1]
Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan, Jr. His fortune was estimated at "only" US$80 million, prompting John D. Rockefeller to say: "and to think, he wasn't even a rich man".

Childhood and education[edit]
Morgan was born into the influential Morgan family in Hartford, Connecticut, and was raised there. He was the son of Junius Spencer Morgan (1813–1890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884).[2][3] Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to the plans of his father. In the fall of 1848, Pierpont transferred to the Hartford Public School and then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut (now called Cheshire Academy), boarding with the principal. In September 1851, Morgan passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, a school specializing in mathematics to prepare young men for careers in commerce. In the spring of 1852, an illness struck which was to become more common as his life progressed. Rheumatic fever left him in so much pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.[4]
He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to the English High School in Boston to resume his studies. After he graduated, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school near the Swiss village of Vevey, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of Göttingen in order to improve his German. He attained a passable level of German within six months and also a degree in art history, then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, with his formal education complete.[5]
Career[edit]
Early years and life[edit]
Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan & Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at $3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for $22 each.[6][7][8][9] Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute $300 to take his place.[6] From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed "J.S. Morgan & Co." upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864–72, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, he partnered with the Drexels of Philadelphia to form the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan & Company. At that time, Anthony J. Drexel became Pierpont's mentor at the request of Junius Morgan.[10]
J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]
Main article: J.P. Morgan & Co.
After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened "J. P. Morgan & Company" in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel & Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes & Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan & Company (after 1910 Morgan, Grenfell & Company) of London. By 1900, it was one of the most powerful banking houses of the world, focused especially on reorganizations and consolidations.[citation needed]
Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge.[11] His process of taking over troubled businesses to reorganize them became known as "Morganization".[12] Morgan reorganized business structures and management in order to return them to profitability. His reputation as a banker and financier also helped bring interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.[13]
Treasury gold[edit]
The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces,[14] to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue.[15] The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.[16]
Newspapers[edit]
In 1896, Adolph Simon Ochs owned the Chattanooga Times, and he secured financing from Morgan to purchase the financially struggling New York Times.[17]
Steel[edit]




J. P. Morgan in his earlier years


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan & Co. (which was renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900. The goal was to buy out Carnegie's steel business and merge it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he finally merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses (including Consolidated Steel and Wire Company, owned by William Edenborn), to form the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901 U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in the world, having an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion, which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads.
U.S. Steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution.[18] It was also planned to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed that U.S. Steel's size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets ("globalization").[18] U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and a host of other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan had captured two-thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 percent market share.[18] However, after 1901 the business' market share dropped. Schwab resigned from U.S. Steel in 1903 to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer.
Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union "troublemakers." The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a "paternalistic" labor policy. (U.S. Steel was eventually unionized in the late 1930s.)[19]
Panic of 1907[edit]




Morgan's role in the economy was denounced as overpowering in this political cartoon


The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis.[20][21] Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked $35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks.[22] Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.[20]
A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over $6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel and he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid $30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.[20]
Vowing to never let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.[23]
Banking's critics[edit]




"I Like a Little Competition"—J. P. Morgan by Art Young. Cartoon relating to the answer Morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the Pujo Committee.[24]


While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected.[25] Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.[26]
Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan & Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of $22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River.[27]
Unsuccessful ventures[edit]
Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.
Tesla[edit]
In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans-Atlantic wireless communication system (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla $150,000 (equivalent to $4,318,200 in 2016) to build the system in return for a 51% control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system.[28] Morgan considered Tesla's changes, and requests for the additional amounts of money to build it, a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.[28][29]
London Subways[edit]
Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to enter the London Underground field. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with "Tube" lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup "the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of".[30]
International Mercantile Marine[edit]
In 1902, J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company (IMMC), an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over-leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re-emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.[31][32]
Morgan corporations[edit]
From 1890–1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.[33]

Later years[edit]




J. P. Morgan, photographed by Edward Steichen in 1903


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan gained control of J. S. Morgan & Co (renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began conversations with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900 with the intention of buying Carnegie's business and several other steel and iron businesses to consolidate them to create the United States Steel Corporation.[18] Carnegie agreed to sell the business to Morgan for $480 million.[18][34] The deal was closed without lawyers and without a written contract. News of the industrial consolidation arrived to newspapers in mid-January 1901. U.S. Steel was founded later that year and was the first billion-dollar company in the world with an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion.[35]
Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black-balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York.[36] He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of $125,000, and commanded Stanford White to "...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense..."[citation needed] He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi (1835–1862). She died the following year. He married Frances Louisa Tracy, known as Fanny (1842–1924), on May 31, 1865. They had four children:

Louisa Pierpont Morgan (1866–1946) who married Herbert L. Satterlee; (1863–1947)[38]
J. P. Morgan, Jr. (1867–1943) who married Jane Norton Grew;
Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1870–1952) who married William Pierson Hamilton (1869–1950);
Anne Tracy Morgan (1873–1952), philanthropist.

Appearance[edit]




Self-conscious about his rosacea, Morgan hated being photographed


Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling "as if a gale had blown through the house."[39] Morgan was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose (because of a chronic skin disease, rosacea).[40] He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed; as a result of his self-consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched.[citation needed] His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt "Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue."[41] Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child Morgan suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son-in-law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.[42] His social and professional self-confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.[43] Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.[44]
Religion[edit]
Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders.[45] He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan.[46] In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their “faith and order.” Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed $100,000 to finance the commission’s work.[47]
Homes[edit]

His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882.[48] It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878.[49] It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned East Island in Glen Cove, New York, where he had a large summer house.
Yachting[edit]

An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts. The well-known quote, "If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it" is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed.[50] A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930.
Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix-les-Bains, France.[51] The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said, "Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death."[52]
Collector[edit]
Morgan was a notable collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (of which he was president and was a major force in its establishment), and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.[53] Morgan was painted by many artists including the Peruvian Carlos Baca-Flor and the Swiss-born American Adolfo Müller-Ury, who also painted a double portrait of Morgan with his favorite grandchild, Mabel Satterlee, that for some years stood on an easel in the Satterlee mansion but has now disappeared.[citation needed]
Benefactor[edit]
Morgan was a benefactor of the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Groton School, Harvard University (especially its medical school), Trinity College, the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.
Gem collector[edit]




U.S. gemstones from the Morgan collection


By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones (over 1,000 pieces). Tiffany & Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.[54]
George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York where they were known as the Morgan-Tiffany and the Morgan-Bement collections.[55] In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer, morganite.
Photography[edit]
Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis $75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians.[56] Curtis eventually published a 20-volume work entitled The North American Indian.[57] Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters (1914), which was restored in 1974 and re-released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.[58]
Death[edit]




The J.P. Morgan Library and Art Museum


Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel in Rome, Italy. Flags on Wall Street flew at half-staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City.[59] His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont "Jack" Morgan, Jr., inherited the banking business.[60] He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
His estate was worth $68.3 million ($1.39 billion in today's dollars based on CPI, or $25.2 billion based on share of GDP), of which about $30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at $50 million.[61]

Legacy[edit]
His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act, the "House of Morgan" became three entities: J.P. Morgan & Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house.
The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.[62]
The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston (at Highlands, New York), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[63]
Popular culture[edit]

A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy.
Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist,[64] in E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime,[65] and in Steven S. Drachman's novel, The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh.[66]
Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher (played by George Coulouris), guardian of the young Citizen Kane (film directed by Orson Welles) with whom he has a tense relationship—Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood.[67]
According to Phil Orbanes, former Vice President of Parker Brothers, Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.[68]
Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America.[69]
My Name Is Morgan (But It Ain't J.P.) - 1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Original released as a "coon song" but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.[70][71][72]

John Pierpont Morgan (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier and banker who dominated corporate finance and industrial consolidation in late 19th and early 20th Century United States.
In 1892, Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. He was also instrumental in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation, International Harvester and AT&T. At the height of Morgan's career during the early 1900s, he and his partners had financial investments in many large corporations and had significant influence over the nation's high finance and United States Congress members. He directed the banking coalition that stopped the Panic of 1907. He was the leading financier of the Progressive Era, and his dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform American business. Morgan has been described as America’s greatest banker.[1]
Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan, Jr. His fortune was estimated at "only" US$80 million, prompting John D. Rockefeller to say: "and to think, he wasn't even a rich man".

Childhood and education[edit]
Morgan was born into the influential Morgan family in Hartford, Connecticut, and was raised there. He was the son of Junius Spencer Morgan (1813–1890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884).[2][3] Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to the plans of his father. In the fall of 1848, Pierpont transferred to the Hartford Public School and then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut (now called Cheshire Academy), boarding with the principal. In September 1851, Morgan passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, a school specializing in mathematics to prepare young men for careers in commerce. In the spring of 1852, an illness struck which was to become more common as his life progressed. Rheumatic fever left him in so much pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.[4]
He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to the English High School in Boston to resume his studies. After he graduated, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school near the Swiss village of Vevey, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of Göttingen in order to improve his German. He attained a passable level of German within six months and also a degree in art history, then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, with his formal education complete.[5]
Career[edit]
Early years and life[edit]
Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan & Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at $3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for $22 each.[6][7][8][9] Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute $300 to take his place.[6] From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed "J.S. Morgan & Co." upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864–72, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, he partnered with the Drexels of Philadelphia to form the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan & Company. At that time, Anthony J. Drexel became Pierpont's mentor at the request of Junius Morgan.[10]
J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]
Main article: J.P. Morgan & Co.
After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened "J. P. Morgan & Company" in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel & Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes & Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan & Company (after 1910 Morgan, Grenfell & Company) of London. By 1900, it was one of the most powerful banking houses of the world, focused especially on reorganizations and consolidations.[citation needed]
Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge.[11] His process of taking over troubled businesses to reorganize them became known as "Morganization".[12] Morgan reorganized business structures and management in order to return them to profitability. His reputation as a banker and financier also helped bring interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.[13]
Treasury gold[edit]
The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces,[14] to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue.[15] The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.[16]
Newspapers[edit]
In 1896, Adolph Simon Ochs owned the Chattanooga Times, and he secured financing from Morgan to purchase the financially struggling New York Times.[17]
Steel[edit]




J. P. Morgan in his earlier years


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan & Co. (which was renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900. The goal was to buy out Carnegie's steel business and merge it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he finally merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses (including Consolidated Steel and Wire Company, owned by William Edenborn), to form the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901 U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in the world, having an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion, which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads.
U.S. Steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution.[18] It was also planned to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed that U.S. Steel's size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets ("globalization").[18] U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and a host of other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan had captured two-thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 percent market share.[18] However, after 1901 the business' market share dropped. Schwab resigned from U.S. Steel in 1903 to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer.
Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union "troublemakers." The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a "paternalistic" labor policy. (U.S. Steel was eventually unionized in the late 1930s.)[19]
Panic of 1907[edit]




Morgan's role in the economy was denounced as overpowering in this political cartoon


The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis.[20][21] Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked $35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks.[22] Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.[20]
A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over $6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel and he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid $30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.[20]
Vowing to never let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.[23]
Banking's critics[edit]




"I Like a Little Competition"—J. P. Morgan by Art Young. Cartoon relating to the answer Morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the Pujo Committee.[24]


While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected.[25] Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.[26]
Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan & Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of $22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River.[27]
Unsuccessful ventures[edit]
Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.
Tesla[edit]
In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans-Atlantic wireless communication system (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla $150,000 (equivalent to $4,318,200 in 2016) to build the system in return for a 51% control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system.[28] Morgan considered Tesla's changes, and requests for the additional amounts of money to build it, a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.[28][29]
London Subways[edit]
Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to enter the London Underground field. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with "Tube" lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup "the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of".[30]
International Mercantile Marine[edit]
In 1902, J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company (IMMC), an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over-leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re-emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.[31][32]
Morgan corporations[edit]
From 1890–1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.[33]

Later years[edit]




J. P. Morgan, photographed by Edward Steichen in 1903


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan gained control of J. S. Morgan & Co (renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began conversations with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900 with the intention of buying Carnegie's business and several other steel and iron businesses to consolidate them to create the United States Steel Corporation.[18] Carnegie agreed to sell the business to Morgan for $480 million.[18][34] The deal was closed without lawyers and without a written contract. News of the industrial consolidation arrived to newspapers in mid-January 1901. U.S. Steel was founded later that year and was the first billion-dollar company in the world with an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion.[35]
Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black-balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York.[36] He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of $125,000, and commanded Stanford White to "...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense..."[citation needed] He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi (1835–1862). She died the following year. He married Frances Louisa Tracy, known as Fanny (1842–1924), on May 31, 1865. They had four children:

Louisa Pierpont Morgan (1866–1946) who married Herbert L. Satterlee; (1863–1947)[38]
J. P. Morgan, Jr. (1867–1943) who married Jane Norton Grew;
Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1870–1952) who married William Pierson Hamilton (1869–1950);
Anne Tracy Morgan (1873–1952), philanthropist.

Appearance[edit]




Self-conscious about his rosacea, Morgan hated being photographed


Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling "as if a gale had blown through the house."[39] Morgan was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose (because of a chronic skin disease, rosacea).[40] He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed; as a result of his self-consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched.[citation needed] His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt "Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue."[41] Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child Morgan suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son-in-law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.[42] His social and professional self-confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.[43] Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.[44]
Religion[edit]
Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders.[45] He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan.[46] In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their “faith and order.” Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed $100,000 to finance the commission’s work.[47]
Homes[edit]

His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882.[48] It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878.[49] It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned East Island in Glen Cove, New York, where he had a large summer house.
Yachting[edit]

An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts. The well-known quote, "If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it" is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed.[50] A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930.
Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix-les-Bains, France.[51] The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said, "Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death."[52]
Collector[edit]
Morgan was a notable collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (of which he was president and was a major force in its establishment), and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.[53] Morgan was painted by many artists including the Peruvian Carlos Baca-Flor and the Swiss-born American Adolfo Müller-Ury, who also painted a double portrait of Morgan with his favorite grandchild, Mabel Satterlee, that for some years stood on an easel in the Satterlee mansion but has now disappeared.[citation needed]
Benefactor[edit]
Morgan was a benefactor of the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Groton School, Harvard University (especially its medical school), Trinity College, the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.
Gem collector[edit]




U.S. gemstones from the Morgan collection


By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones (over 1,000 pieces). Tiffany & Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.[54]
George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York where they were known as the Morgan-Tiffany and the Morgan-Bement collections.[55] In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer, morganite.
Photography[edit]
Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis $75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians.[56] Curtis eventually published a 20-volume work entitled The North American Indian.[57] Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters (1914), which was restored in 1974 and re-released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.[58]
Death[edit]




The J.P. Morgan Library and Art Museum


Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel in Rome, Italy. Flags on Wall Street flew at half-staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City.[59] His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont "Jack" Morgan, Jr., inherited the banking business.[60] He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
His estate was worth $68.3 million ($1.39 billion in today's dollars based on CPI, or $25.2 billion based on share of GDP), of which about $30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at $50 million.[61]

Legacy[edit]
His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act, the "House of Morgan" became three entities: J.P. Morgan & Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house.
The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.[62]
The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston (at Highlands, New York), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[63]
Popular culture[edit]

A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy.
Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist,[64] in E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime,[65] and in Steven S. Drachman's novel, The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh.[66]
Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher (played by George Coulouris), guardian of the young Citizen Kane (film directed by Orson Welles) with whom he has a tense relationship—Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood.[67]
According to Phil Orbanes, former Vice President of Parker Brothers, Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.[68]
Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America.[69]
My Name Is Morgan (But It Ain't J.P.) - 1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Original released as a "coon song" but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.[70][71][72]

John Pierpont Morgan (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier and banker who dominated corporate finance and industrial consolidation in late 19th and early 20th Century United States.
In 1892, Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. He was also instrumental in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation, International Harvester and AT&T. At the height of Morgan's career during the early 1900s, he and his partners had financial investments in many large corporations and had significant influence over the nation's high finance and United States Congress members. He directed the banking coalition that stopped the Panic of 1907. He was the leading financier of the Progressive Era, and his dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform American business. Morgan has been described as America’s greatest banker.[1]
Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan, Jr. His fortune was estimated at "only" US$80 million, prompting John D. Rockefeller to say: "and to think, he wasn't even a rich man".

Childhood and education[edit]
Morgan was born into the influential Morgan family in Hartford, Connecticut, and was raised there. He was the son of Junius Spencer Morgan (1813–1890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884).[2][3] Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to the plans of his father. In the fall of 1848, Pierpont transferred to the Hartford Public School and then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut (now called Cheshire Academy), boarding with the principal. In September 1851, Morgan passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, a school specializing in mathematics to prepare young men for careers in commerce. In the spring of 1852, an illness struck which was to become more common as his life progressed. Rheumatic fever left him in so much pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.[4]
He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to the English High School in Boston to resume his studies. After he graduated, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school near the Swiss village of Vevey, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of Göttingen in order to improve his German. He attained a passable level of German within six months and also a degree in art history, then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, with his formal education complete.[5]
Career[edit]
Early years and life[edit]
Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan & Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at $3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for $22 each.[6][7][8][9] Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute $300 to take his place.[6] From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed "J.S. Morgan & Co." upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864–72, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, he partnered with the Drexels of Philadelphia to form the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan & Company. At that time, Anthony J. Drexel became Pierpont's mentor at the request of Junius Morgan.[10]
J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]
Main article: J.P. Morgan & Co.
After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened "J. P. Morgan & Company" in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel & Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes & Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan & Company (after 1910 Morgan, Grenfell & Company) of London. By 1900, it was one of the most powerful banking houses of the world, focused especially on reorganizations and consolidations.[citation needed]
Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge.[11] His process of taking over troubled businesses to reorganize them became known as "Morganization".[12] Morgan reorganized business structures and management in order to return them to profitability. His reputation as a banker and financier also helped bring interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.[13]
Treasury gold[edit]
The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces,[14] to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue.[15] The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.[16]
Newspapers[edit]
In 1896, Adolph Simon Ochs owned the Chattanooga Times, and he secured financing from Morgan to purchase the financially struggling New York Times.[17]
Steel[edit]




J. P. Morgan in his earlier years


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan & Co. (which was renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900. The goal was to buy out Carnegie's steel business and merge it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he finally merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses (including Consolidated Steel and Wire Company, owned by William Edenborn), to form the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901 U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in the world, having an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion, which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads.
U.S. Steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution.[18] It was also planned to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed that U.S. Steel's size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets ("globalization").[18] U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and a host of other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan had captured two-thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 percent market share.[18] However, after 1901 the business' market share dropped. Schwab resigned from U.S. Steel in 1903 to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer.
Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union "troublemakers." The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a "paternalistic" labor policy. (U.S. Steel was eventually unionized in the late 1930s.)[19]
Panic of 1907[edit]




Morgan's role in the economy was denounced as overpowering in this political cartoon


The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis.[20][21] Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked $35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks.[22] Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.[20]
A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over $6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel and he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid $30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.[20]
Vowing to never let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.[23]
Banking's critics[edit]




"I Like a Little Competition"—J. P. Morgan by Art Young. Cartoon relating to the answer Morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the Pujo Committee.[24]


While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected.[25] Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.[26]
Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan & Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of $22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River.[27]
Unsuccessful ventures[edit]
Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.
Tesla[edit]
In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans-Atlantic wireless communication system (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla $150,000 (equivalent to $4,318,200 in 2016) to build the system in return for a 51% control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system.[28] Morgan considered Tesla's changes, and requests for the additional amounts of money to build it, a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.[28][29]
London Subways[edit]
Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to enter the London Underground field. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with "Tube" lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup "the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of".[30]
International Mercantile Marine[edit]
In 1902, J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company (IMMC), an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over-leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re-emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.[31][32]
Morgan corporations[edit]
From 1890–1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.[33]

Later years[edit]

After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan gained control of J. S. Morgan & Co (renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began conversations with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900 with the intention of buying Carnegie's business and several other steel and iron businesses to consolidate them to create the United States Steel Corporation.[18] Carnegie agreed to sell the business to Morgan for $480 million.[18][34] The deal was closed without lawyers and without a written contract. News of the industrial consolidation arrived to newspapers in mid-January 1901. U.S. Steel was founded later that year and was the first billion-dollar company in the world with an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion.[35]
Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black-balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York.[36] He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of $125,000, and commanded Stanford White to "...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense..."[citation needed] He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi (1835–1862). She died the following year. He married Frances Louisa Tracy, known as Fanny (1842–1924), on May 31, 1865. They had four children:

Louisa Pierpont Morgan (1866–1946) who married Herbert L. Satterlee; (1863–1947)[38]
J. P. Morgan, Jr. (1867–1943) who married Jane Norton Grew;
Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1870–1952) who married William Pierson Hamilton (1869–1950);
Anne Tracy Morgan (1873–1952), philanthropist.

Appearance[edit]




Self-conscious about his rosacea, Morgan hated being photographed


Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling "as if a gale had blown through the house."[39] Morgan was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose (because of a chronic skin disease, rosacea).[40] He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed; as a result of his self-consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched.[citation needed] His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt "Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue."[41] Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child Morgan suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son-in-law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.[42] His social and professional self-confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.[43] Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.[44]
Religion[edit]
Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders.[45] He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan.[46] In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their “faith and order.” Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed $100,000 to finance the commission’s work.[47]
Homes[edit]

His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882.[48] It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878.[49] It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned East Island in Glen Cove, New York, where he had a large summer house.
Yachting[edit]

An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts. The well-known quote, "If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it" is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed.[50] A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930.
Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix-les-Bains, France.[51] The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said, "Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death."[52]
Collector[edit]
Morgan was a notable collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (of which he was president and was a major force in its establishment), and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.[53] Morgan was painted by many artists including the Peruvian Carlos Baca-Flor and the Swiss-born American Adolfo Müller-Ury, who also painted a double portrait of Morgan with his favorite grandchild, Mabel Satterlee, that for some years stood on an easel in the Satterlee mansion but has now disappeared.[citation needed]
Benefactor[edit]
Morgan was a benefactor of the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Groton School, Harvard University (especially its medical school), Trinity College, the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.
Gem collector[edit]




U.S. gemstones from the Morgan collection


By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones (over 1,000 pieces). Tiffany & Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.[54]
George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York where they were known as the Morgan-Tiffany and the Morgan-Bement collections.[55] In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer, morganite.
Photography[edit]
Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis $75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians.[56] Curtis eventually published a 20-volume work entitled The North American Indian.[57] Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters (1914), which was restored in 1974 and re-released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.[58]
Death[edit]




The J.P. Morgan Library and Art Museum


Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel in Rome, Italy. Flags on Wall Street flew at half-staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City.[59] His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont "Jack" Morgan, Jr., inherited the banking business.[60] He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
His estate was worth $68.3 million ($1.39 billion in today's dollars based on CPI, or $25.2 billion based on share of GDP), of which about $30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at $50 million.[61]

Legacy[edit]
His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act, the "House of Morgan" became three entities: J.P. Morgan & Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house.
The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.[62]
The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston (at Highlands, New York), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[63]
Popular culture[edit]

A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy.
Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist,[64] in E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime,[65] and in Steven S. Drachman's novel, The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh.[66]
Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher (played by George Coulouris), guardian of the young Citizen Kane (film directed by Orson Welles) with whom he has a tense relationship—Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood.[67]
According to Phil Orbanes, former Vice President of Parker Brothers, Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.[68]
Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America.[69]
My Name Is Morgan (But It Ain't J.P.) - 1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Original released as a "coon song" but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.[70][71][72]

John Pierpont Morgan (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier and banker who dominated corporate finance and industrial consolidation in late 19th and early 20th Century United States.
In 1892, Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. He was also instrumental in the creation of the United States Steel Corporation, International Harvester and AT&T. At the height of Morgan's career during the early 1900s, he and his partners had financial investments in many large corporations and had significant influence over the nation's high finance and United States Congress members. He directed the banking coalition that stopped the Panic of 1907. He was the leading financier of the Progressive Era, and his dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform American business. Morgan has been described as America’s greatest banker.[1]
Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan, Jr. His fortune was estimated at "only" US$80 million, prompting John D. Rockefeller to say: "and to think, he wasn't even a rich man".

Childhood and education[edit]
Morgan was born into the influential Morgan family in Hartford, Connecticut, and was raised there. He was the son of Junius Spencer Morgan (1813–1890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816–1884).[2][3] Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to the plans of his father. In the fall of 1848, Pierpont transferred to the Hartford Public School and then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut (now called Cheshire Academy), boarding with the principal. In September 1851, Morgan passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, a school specializing in mathematics to prepare young men for careers in commerce. In the spring of 1852, an illness struck which was to become more common as his life progressed. Rheumatic fever left him in so much pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.[4]
He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to the English High School in Boston to resume his studies. After he graduated, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school near the Swiss village of Vevey, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of Göttingen in order to improve his German. He attained a passable level of German within six months and also a degree in art history, then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, with his formal education complete.[5]
Career[edit]
Early years and life[edit]
Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan & Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman & Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at $3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for $22 each.[6][7][8][9] Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute $300 to take his place.[6] From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed "J.S. Morgan & Co." upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864–72, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, he partnered with the Drexels of Philadelphia to form the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan & Company. At that time, Anthony J. Drexel became Pierpont's mentor at the request of Junius Morgan.[10]
J.P. Morgan & Company[edit]
Main article: J.P. Morgan & Co.
After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened "J. P. Morgan & Company" in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel & Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes & Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan & Company (after 1910 Morgan, Grenfell & Company) of London. By 1900, it was one of the most powerful banking houses of the world, focused especially on reorganizations and consolidations.[citation needed]
Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge.[11] His process of taking over troubled businesses to reorganize them became known as "Morganization".[12] Morgan reorganized business structures and management in order to return them to profitability. His reputation as a banker and financier also helped bring interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.[13]
Treasury gold[edit]
The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces,[14] to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue.[15] The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.[16]
Newspapers[edit]
In 1896, Adolph Simon Ochs owned the Chattanooga Times, and he secured financing from Morgan to purchase the financially struggling New York Times.[17]
Steel[edit]




J. P. Morgan in his earlier years


After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan & Co. (which was renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900. The goal was to buy out Carnegie's steel business and merge it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he finally merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses (including Consolidated Steel and Wire Company, owned by William Edenborn), to form the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901 U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in the world, having an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion, which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads.
U.S. Steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution.[18] It was also planned to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed that U.S. Steel's size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets ("globalization").[18] U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and a host of other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan had captured two-thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 percent market share.[18] However, after 1901 the business' market share dropped. Schwab resigned from U.S. Steel in 1903 to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer.
Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union "troublemakers." The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a "paternalistic" labor policy. (U.S. Steel was eventually unionized in the late 1930s.)[19]
Panic of 1907[edit]




Morgan's role in the economy was denounced as overpowering in this political cartoon


The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis.[20][21] Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked $35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks.[22] Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.[20]
A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over $6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel and he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid $30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.[20]
Vowing to never let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.[23]
Banking's critics[edit]




"I Like a Little Competition"—J. P. Morgan by Art Young. Cartoon relating to the answer Morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the Pujo Committee.[24]


While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected.[25] Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.[26]
Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan & Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of $22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty-two states west of the Mississippi River.[27]
Unsuccessful ventures[edit]
Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.
Tesla[edit]
In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans-Atlantic wireless communication system (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla $150,000 (equivalent to $4,318,200 in 2016) to build the system in return for a 51% control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system.[28] Morgan considered Tesla's changes, and requests for the additional amounts of money to build it, a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.[28][29]
London Subways[edit]
Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to enter the London Underground field. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with "Tube" lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup "the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of".[30]
International Mercantile Marine[edit]
In 1902, J.P. Morgan & Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company (IMMC), an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over-leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re-emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.[31][32]
Morgan corporations[edit]
From 1890–1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.[33]

Later years[edit]

After the death of his father in 1890, Morgan gained control of J. S. Morgan & Co (renamed Morgan, Grenfell & Company in 1910). Morgan began conversations with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900 with the intention of buying Carnegie's business and several other steel and iron businesses to consolidate them to create the United States Steel Corporation.[18] Carnegie agreed to sell the business to Morgan for $480 million.[18][34] The deal was closed without lawyers and without a written contract. News of the industrial consolidation arrived to newspapers in mid-January 1901. U.S. Steel was founded later that year and was the first billion-dollar company in the world with an authorized capitalization of $1.4 billion.[35]
Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black-balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York.[36] He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of $125,000, and commanded Stanford White to "...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense..."[citation needed] He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi (1835–1862). She died the following year. He married Frances Louisa Tracy, known as Fanny (1842–1924), on May 31, 1865. They had four children:

Louisa Pierpont Morgan (1866–1946) who married Herbert L. Satterlee; (1863–1947)[38]
J. P. Morgan, Jr. (1867–1943) who married Jane Norton Grew;
Juliet Pierpont Morgan (1870–1952) who married William Pierson Hamilton (1869–1950);
Anne Tracy Morgan (1873–1952), philanthropist.

Appearance[edit]




Self-conscious about his rosacea, Morgan hated being photographed


Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling "as if a gale had blown through the house."[39] Morgan was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose (because of a chronic skin disease, rosacea).[40] He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed; as a result of his self-consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched.[citation needed] His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt "Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue."[41] Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child Morgan suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son-in-law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.[42] His social and professional self-confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.[43] Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.[44]
Religion[edit]
Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders.[45] He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan.[46] In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their “faith and order.” Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed $100,000 to finance the commission’s work.[47]
Homes[edit]

His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882.[48] It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878.[49] It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned East Island in Glen Cove, New York, where he had a large summer house.
Yachting[edit]

An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts. The well-known quote, "If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it" is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed.[50] A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930.
Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix-les-Bains, France.[51] The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said, "Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death."[52]
Collector[edit]
Morgan was a notable collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (of which he was president and was a major force in its establishment), and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.[53] Morgan was painted by many artists including the Peruvian Carlos Baca-Flor and the Swiss-born American Adolfo Müller-Ury, who also painted a double portrait of Morgan with his favorite grandchild, Mabel Satterlee, that for some years stood on an easel in the Satterlee mansion but has now disappeared.[citation needed]
Benefactor[edit]
Morgan was a benefactor of the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Groton School, Harvard University (especially its medical school), Trinity College, the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.
Gem collector[edit]




U.S. gemstones from the Morgan collection


By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones (over 1,000 pieces). Tiffany & Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.[54]
George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York where they were known as the Morgan-Tiffany and the Morgan-Bement collections.[55] In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer, morganite.
Photography[edit]
Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis $75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians.[56] Curtis eventually published a 20-volume work entitled The North American Indian.[57] Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters (1914), which was restored in 1974 and re-released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.[58]
Death[edit]




The J.P. Morgan Library and Art Museum


Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel in Rome, Italy. Flags on Wall Street flew at half-staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City.[59] His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont "Jack" Morgan, Jr., inherited the banking business.[60] He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
His estate was worth $68.3 million ($1.39 billion in today's dollars based on CPI, or $25.2 billion based on share of GDP), of which about $30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at $50 million.[61]

Legacy[edit]
His son, J. P. Morgan, Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act, the "House of Morgan" became three entities: J.P. Morgan & Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house.
The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.[62]
The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston (at Highlands, New York), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[63]
Popular culture[edit]

A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy.
Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist,[64] in E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime,[65] and in Steven S. Drachman's novel, The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh.[66]
Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher (played by George Coulouris), guardian of the young Citizen Kane (film directed by Orson Welles) with whom he has a tense relationship—Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood.[67]
According to Phil Orbanes, former Vice President of Parker Brothers, Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.[68]
Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America.[69]
My Name Is Morgan (But It Ain't J.P.) - 1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Original released as a "coon song" but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.[70][71][72]

J.P. Morgan Ordered to Pay $18 Million to Oil Heiress’s Trust


				By Susanne Craig			
October 10, 2012 2:30 pm

James Gibbard/Tulsa WorldJudge Linda G. Morrissey of the Tulsa County District Court in Oklahoma.
8:01 p.m. | Updated 
Trust accounts require advisers to be even more diligent in putting the interests of clients ahead of the banks’.
This week, an Oklahoma judge found that JPMorgan Chase had been “grossly negligent and reckless” in its administration of one client’s trust account and ordered the bank to pay $18 million.
In a harshly worded opinion released late Tuesday, Judge Linda G. Morrissey of the Tulsa County District Court in Oklahoma said that the bank had breached a series of fiduciary duties in its handling of the trust of Carolyn S. Burford, an oil heiress who died in 1996. The court also ordered JPMorgan to pay punitive damages, to be set at a later date, along with the trust’s legal fees.
 Judge Morrissey concluded that JPMorgan had breached its fiduciary duty in 2000 when it sold what are known as variable prepaid forward contracts to the trust, a complex fee-rich product that the judge determined was unsuitable for the trust.
“We disagree with the court’s decision and will take all appropriate measures to respond, including appealing the decision,” JPMorgan said in a statement.
Erin Donovan, a lawyer for one of the Burford family members, praised the ruling. “I think the judge was affronted by the fact that JPMorgan, which was in a position of trust, betrayed it for their own benefit.”
This case is likely to put a spotlight on trust accounts. Under the current law, some stockbrokers are required to act in a customer’s best interest — but that is a less-stringent standard that allows them to sell products that are suitable, but not necessarily in a client’s best interest. Brokers who handle trust accounts are held to the higher standard and have to do what is best for the client alone.
The contracts in this case were pitched as a way to generate more income for the trust, which was established in 1955 by Ms. Burford’s parents. The trust now benefits Ann Fletcher, Ms. Burford’s daughter.
Carolyn Burford’s father founded Skelly Oil and her mother had ties with another oil company. The trust initially contained a significant amount of Exxon Mobil stock. JPMorgan and the trust entered into several variable prepaid forward contracts from 2000 to 2005.
The judge found that JPMorgan, which ended up with the account after a series of bank mergers, had not properly explained the product to its client and had failed to disclose that the bank was benefiting from the transaction. The bank also breached its duty when it invested the proceeds of the contracts in its own investment products, which the judge said “amounted to double dipping” that was unreasonable.
“The bank provided incentives to its employees to generate revenue for the bank. This created a situation in which the self-interest of employees managing and advising fiduciary accounts was placed in conflict with the interest of those to whom the bank owed fiduciary duties,” the judge wrote.
The misconduct in the case, the judge added, showed a serious disregard for customers of the bank, which was aware “or recklessly failed to be aware” of the conduct at issue.
“The court finds that beyond simply restoring the trust in the position in which it should have been maintained, it is appropriate to assess punitive damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the bank for its conduct,” Judge Morrissey wrote.
Correction: October 10, 2012 An earlier version of this article misstated the jurisdiction of Judge Linda G. Morrissey. She is a district judge for the Tulsa County District Court, which is a state court in Oklahoma, not for the United States District Court, which is also in Tulsa.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES 
As noted in the applicable 
Prospectuses for each of the Funds, in addition to the main investment strategy 
and the main investment risks described in the Prospectuses, each Fund may 
employ other investment strategies and may be subject to other risks, which are 
described below. The Funds may engage in the practices described below to the 
extent consistent with their investment objectives, strategies, policies and 
restrictions. However, no Fund is required to engage in any particular 
transaction or purchase any particular type of securities or investment even if 
to do so might benefit the Fund. Because the following is a combined description 
of investment strategies of all of the Funds, (i) certain matters described 
herein may not apply to particular Funds and (ii) certain references to the 
Adviser may also include a Sub-Adviser, as the context requires. 
For a list of investment 
strategies and policies employed by each Fund, see “INVESTMENT PRACTICES” in 
Part I of this SAI. 
Asset-Backed Securities 
Asset-backed securities consist of 
securities secured by company receivables, home equity loans, truck and auto 
loans, leases, or credit card receivables. Asset-backed securities also include 
other securities backed by other types of receivables or other assets, including 
collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), which include collateralized bond 
obligations (“CBOs”), collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and other 
similarly structured securities. Such assets are generally securitized through 
the use of trusts or special purpose corporations. Asset-backed securities are 
backed by a pool of assets representing the obligations often of a number of 
different parties. Certain of these securities may be illiquid. 
Asset-backed securities are 
generally subject to the risks of the underlying assets. In addition, 
asset-backed securities, in general, are subject to certain additional risks 
including depreciation, damage or loss of the collateral backing the security, 
failure of the collateral to generate the anticipated cash flow or in certain 
cases more rapid prepayment because of events affecting the collateral, such as 
accelerated prepayment of loans backing these securities or destruction of 
equipment subject to equipment trust certificates. In addition, the underlying 
assets (for example, the underlying credit card debt) may be refinanced or paid 
off prior to maturity during periods of declining interest rates. Changes in 
prepayment rates can result in greater price and yield volatility. If 
asset-backed securities are pre-paid, a 
Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds from the securities at a lower rate. 
Potential market gains on a security subject to prepayment risk may be more 
limited than potential market gains on a comparable security that is not subject 
to prepayment risk. Under certain prepayment rate scenarios, a Fund may fail to 
recover additional amounts paid (i.e., premiums) for securities with higher 
interest rates, resulting in an unexpected loss. 
A CBO is a trust or other special 
purpose entity (“SPE”) which is typically backed by a diversified pool of fixed 
income securities (which may include high risk, below investment grade 
securities). A CLO is a trust or other SPE that is typically collateralized by a 
pool of loans, which may include, among others, domestic and non-U.S. senior secured loans, senior 
unsecured loans, and subordinate corporate loans, including loans that may be 
rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans. Although certain CDOs 
may receive credit enhancement in the form of a senior-subordinate structure, 
over-collateralization or bond insurance, such enhancement may not always be 
present and may fail to protect a Fund against the risk of loss on default of 
the collateral. Certain CDOs may use derivatives contracts to create “synthetic” 
exposure to assets rather than holding such assets directly, which entails the 
risks of derivative instruments described elsewhere in this SAI. CDOs may charge 
management fees and administrative expenses, which are in addition to those of a 
Fund. 
For both CBOs and CLOs, the cash 
flows from the SPE are split into two or more portions, called tranches, varying 
in risk and yield. The riskiest portion is the “equity” tranche, which bears the 
first loss from defaults from the bonds or loans in the SPE and serves to 
protect the other, more senior tranches from default (though such protection is 
not complete). Since it is partially protected from defaults, a senior tranche 
from a CBO or CLO typically has higher ratings and lower yields than its 
underlying securities, and may be rated investment grade. Despite the protection 
from the equity tranche, CBO or CLO tranches can experience substantial losses 
due to actual defaults, downgrades of the underlying collateral by rating 
agencies, forced liquidation of the collateral pool due to a failure of coverage 
tests, increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and 
disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation of defaults, as well 
as investor aversion to CBO or CLO securities as a class. Interest on certain 
tranches of a CDO may be paid in kind or deferred and capitalized (paid in the 
form of obligations of the same type rather than cash), which involves continued 
exposure to default risk with respect to such payments. 
The risks of an investment in a CDO 
depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the CDO 
in which a Fund invests. Normally, CBOs, CLOs and other CDOs are privately 
offered and sold, and thus are 
 


not registered under the securities 
laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized by a Fund as 
illiquid securities. However, an active dealer market may exist for CDOs, 
allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions. In addition to the normal 
risks associated with fixed income securities and asset-backed securities 
generally discussed elsewhere in this SAI, CDOs carry additional risks 
including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from 
collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; 
(ii) the risk that the collateral may default or decline in value or be 
downgraded, if rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
(“NRSRO”); (iii) a Fund may invest in tranches of CDOs that are subordinate 
to other tranches; (iv) the structure and complexity of the transaction and 
the legal documents could lead to disputes among investors regarding the 
characterization of proceeds; (v) the investment return achieved by the 
Fund could be significantly different than those predicted by financial models; 
(vi) the lack of a readily available secondary market for CDOs; 
(vii) risk of forced “fire sale” liquidation due to technical defaults such 
as coverage test failures; and (viii) the CDO’s manager may perform poorly. 

Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 
set forth in the fee table and Financial Highlights section of each Fund’s 
Prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain 
structured or synthetic products that may rely on the exception for the 
definition of “investment company” provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) 
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). 
Auction Rate Securities 
Auction rate securities consist of 
auction rate municipal securities and auction rate preferred securities sold 
through an auction process issued by closed-end investment companies, 
municipalities and governmental agencies. For more information on risks 
associated with municipal securities, see “Municipal Securities” below. 

Provided that the auction mechanism 
is successful, auction rate securities usually permit the holder to sell the 
securities in an auction at par value at specified intervals. The dividend is 
reset by “Dutch” auction in which bids are made by broker-dealers and other 
institutions for a certain amount of securities at a specified minimum yield. 
The dividend rate set by the auction is the lowest interest or dividend rate 
that covers all securities offered for sale. While this process is designed to 
permit auction rate securities to be traded at par value, there is the risk that 
an auction will fail due to insufficient demand for the securities. Since 
February 2008, numerous auctions have failed due to insufficient demand for 
securities and have continued to fail for an extended period of time. Failed 
auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of auction rate securities 
investments. Although some issuers of auction rate securities are redeeming or 
are considering redeeming such securities, such issuers are not obligated to do 
so and, therefore, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for a 
Fund’s investments in auction rate securities at a time when the Fund wishes to 
dispose of such securities. 
Dividends on auction rate preferred 
securities issued by a closed-end fund 
may be designated as exempt from federal income tax to the extent they are 
attributable to tax-exempt interest 
income earned by the closed-end fund on 
the securities in its portfolio and distributed to holders of the preferred 
securities. However, such designation may be made only if the closed-end fund treats preferred securities 
as equity securities for federal income tax purposes and the closed-end fund complies with certain 
requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 

A Fund’s investment in auction rate 
preferred securities of closed-end 
funds is subject to limitations on investments in other U.S. registered 
investment companies, which limitations are prescribed under the 1940 Act. 
Except as permitted by rule or exemptive order (see “Investment Company 
Securities and Exchange-Traded Funds” below for more information), a Fund is 
generally prohibited from acquiring more than 3% of the voting securities of any 
other such investment company, and investing more than 5% of a Fund’s total 
assets in securities of any one such investment company or more than 10% of its 
total assets in securities of all such investment companies. A Fund will 
indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees paid by such 
closed-end funds in addition to the 
advisory fee payable directly by the Fund. 
Bank 
Obligations 
Bank obligations consist of bankers’ 
acceptances, certificates of deposit, bank notes and time deposits. 
Bankers’ acceptances are negotiable 
drafts or bills of exchange typically drawn by an importer or exporter to pay 
for specific merchandise, which are “accepted” by a bank, meaning, in effect, 
that the bank unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on 
maturity. To be eligible for purchase by a Fund, a bankers’ acceptance must be 
guaranteed by a domestic or foreign bank or savings and loan association having, 
at the time of investment, total assets in excess of $1 billion (as of the date 
of its most recently published financial statements). 
 
Part II - 2 


Certificates of deposit are 
negotiable certificates issued against funds deposited in a commercial bank or a 
savings and loan association for a definite period of time and earning a 
specified return. Certificates of deposit may also include those issued by 
foreign banks outside the United States (“U.S.”) with total assets at the time 
of purchase in excess of the equivalent of $1 billion. Such certificates of 
deposit include Eurodollar and Yankee certificates of deposit. Eurodollar 
certificates of deposit are U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit 
issued by branches of foreign and domestic banks located outside the U.S. Yankee 
certificates of deposit are certificates of deposit issued by a U.S. branch of a 
foreign bank denominated in U.S. dollars and held in the U.S. Certain Funds may 
also invest in obligations (including bankers’ acceptances and certificates of 
deposit) denominated in foreign currencies (see “Foreign Investments (including 
Foreign Currencies)”) herein. With regard to certificates of deposit issued by 
U.S. banks and savings and loan associations, to be eligible for purchase by a 
Fund, a certificate of deposit must be issued by (i) a domestic or foreign 
branch of a U.S. commercial bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System 
or the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, or (ii) a domestic savings and loan association, the deposits 
of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provided that, 
in each case, at the time of purchase, such institution has total assets in 
excess of $1 billion (as of the date of its most recently published financial 
statements). 
Time deposits are interest-bearing 
non-negotiable deposits at a bank or a 
savings and loan association that have a specific maturity date. A time deposit 
earns a specific rate of interest over a definite period of time. Time deposits 
cannot be traded on the secondary market and those exceeding seven days and with 
a withdrawal penalty are considered to be illiquid. Time deposits will be 
maintained only at banks and savings and loan associations from which a Fund 
could purchase certificates of deposit. 
The Funds will not invest in 
obligations for which a Fund’s Adviser, or any of its affiliated persons, is the 
ultimate obligor or accepting bank, provided, however, that the Funds maintain 
demand deposits at their affiliated custodian, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
(“JPMorgan Chase Bank”). 
Subject to the Funds’ limitations on 
concentration in a particular industry, there is no limitation on the amount of 
a Fund’s assets which may be invested in obligations of banks which meet the 
conditions set forth herein. 
Commercial Paper 
Commercial paper is defined as 
short-term obligations, generally with maturities from 1 to 270 days issued by 
banks or bank holding companies, corporations and finance companies. Although 
commercial paper is generally unsecured, the Funds may also purchase secured 
commercial paper. In the event of a default of an issuer of secured commercial 
paper, a Fund may hold the securities and other investments that were pledged as 
collateral even if it does not invest in such securities or investments. In such 
a case, the Fund would take steps to dispose of such securities or investments 
in a commercially reasonable manner. Commercial paper includes master demand 
obligations. See “Variable and Floating Rate Instruments” below. 
Certain Funds may also invest in 
Canadian commercial paper, which is commercial paper issued by a Canadian 
corporation or a Canadian counterpart of a U.S. corporation, and in Europaper, 
which is U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper of a foreign issuer. See “Risk 
Factors of Foreign Investments” below. 
Convertible Securities 
Certain Funds may invest in 
convertible securities. Convertible securities include any debt securities or 
preferred stock which may be converted into common stock or which carry the 
right to purchase common stock. Generally, convertible securities entitle the 
holder to exchange the securities for a specified number of shares of common 
stock, usually of the same company, at specified prices within a certain period 
of time. 
The terms of any convertible 
security determine its ranking in a company’s capital structure. In the case of 
subordinated convertible debentures, the holders’ claims on assets and earnings 
are subordinated to the claims of other creditors, and are senior to the claims 
of preferred and common shareholders. In the case of convertible preferred 
stock, the holders’ claims on assets and earnings are subordinated to the claims 
of all creditors and are senior to the claims of common shareholders. 

Convertible securities have 
characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities. Due to the 
conversion feature, the market value of convertible securities tends to move 
together with the market value of the underlying common stock. As a result, 
selection of convertible securities, to a great extent, is based on the 
potential for capital appreciation that may exist in the underlying stock. The 
value of convertible securities is also affected by prevailing interest rates, 
the credit quality of the issuer, and any call provisions. In some cases, the 
issuer may cause a 
 
Part II - 3 


convertible security to convert to 
common stock. In other situations, it may be advantageous for a Fund to cause 
the conversion of convertible securities to common stock. If a convertible 
security converts to common stock, a Fund may hold such common stock in its 
portfolio even if it does not ordinarily invest in common stock. 
Certain Funds invest in contingent 
securities structured as contingent convertible securities also known as CoCos. 
Contingent convertible securities are typically issued by non-U.S. banks and are 
designed to behave like bonds in times of economic health yet absorb losses when 
a pre-determined trigger event occurs. A contingent convertible security is a 
hybrid debt security either convertible into equity at a predetermined share 
price or written down in value based on the specific terms of the individual 
security if a pre-specified trigger event occurs (the “Trigger Event”). Unlike 
traditional convertible securities, the conversion of a contingent convertible 
security from debt to equity is “contingent” and will occur only in the case of 
a Trigger Event. Trigger Events vary by instrument and are defined by the 
documents governing the contingent convertible security. Such Trigger Events may 
include a decline in the issuer’s capital below a specified threshold level, 
increase in the issuer’s risk weighted assets, the share price of the issuer 
falling to a particular level for a certain period of time and certain 
regulatory events. 
Contingent convertible securities 
are subject to the credit, interest rate, high yield security, foreign security 
and markets risks associated with bonds and equities, and to the risks specific 
to convertible securities in general. Contingent convertible securities are also 
subject to additional risks specific to their structure including conversion 
risk. Because Trigger Events are not consistently defined among contingent 
convertible securities, this risk is greater for contingent convertible 
securities that are issued by banks with capital ratios close to the level 
specified in the Trigger Event. 
In addition, coupon payments on 
contingent convertible securities are discretionary and may be cancelled by the 
issuer at any point, for any reason, and for any length of time. The 
discretionary cancellation of payments is not an event of default and there are 
no remedies to require re-instatement of coupon payments or payment of any past 
missed payments. Coupon payments may also be subject to approval by the issuer’s 
regulator and may be suspended in the event there are insufficient distributable 
reserves. Due to uncertainty surrounding coupon payments, contingent convertible 
securities may be volatile and their price may decline rapidly in the event that 
coupon payments are suspended. 
Contingent convertible securities 
typically are structurally subordinated to traditional convertible bonds in the 
issuer’s capital structure. In certain scenarios, investors in contingent 
convertible securities may suffer a loss of capital ahead of equity holders or 
when equity holders do not. Contingent convertible securities are also subject 
to extension risk. Contingent convertible securities are perpetual instruments 
and may only be callable at pre-determined dates upon approval of the applicable 
regulatory authority. There is no guarantee that a Fund will receive return of 
principal on contingent convertible securities. 
Convertible contingent securities 
are a newer form of instrument and the regulatory environment for these 
instruments continues to evolve. Because the market for contingent convertible 
securities is evolving, it is uncertain how the larger market for contingent 
convertible securities would react to a Trigger Event or coupon suspension 
applicable to a single issuer. 
The value of contingent convertible 
securities is unpredictable and will be influenced by many factors such as: 
(i) the creditworthiness of the issuer and/or fluctuations in such issuer’s 
applicable capital ratios; (ii) supply and demand for contingent 
convertible securities; (iii) general market conditions and available 
liquidity; and (iv) economic, financial and political events that affect 
the issuer, its particular market or the financial markets in general. 

Custodial Receipts 
Certain Funds may acquire securities 
in the form of custodial receipts that evidence ownership of future interest 
payments, principal payments or both on certain U.S. Treasury notes or bonds in 
connection with programs sponsored by banks and brokerage firms. These are not 
considered U.S. government securities and are not backed by the full faith and 
credit of the U.S. government. These notes and bonds are held in custody by a 
bank on behalf of the owners of the receipts. 
Debt 
Instruments 
Below 
Investment Grade Securities. Securities that were rated investment grade at 
the time of purchase may subsequently be rated below investment grade (BB+ or 
lower by Standard & Poor’s Corporation (“S&P”) and Bal or lower by 
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”)). Certain Funds that do not invest 
in below investment grade securities as a main investment strategy may 
nonetheless continue to hold such securities if the Adviser believes it is 

 
Part II - 4 


advantageous for the Fund to do so. 
The high degree of risk involved in these investments can result in substantial 
or total losses. These securities are subject to greater risk of loss, greater 
sensitivity to interest rate and economic changes, valuation difficulties, and a 
potential lack of a secondary or public market for securities. The market price 
of these securities also can change suddenly and unexpectedly. 
Corporate Debt Securities. Corporate debt 
securities may include bonds and other debt securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers, including obligations of 
industrial, utility, banking and other corporate issuers. All debt securities 
are subject to the risk of an issuer’s inability to meet principal and interest 
payments on the obligation and may also be subject to price volatility due to 
such factors as market interest rates, market perception of the creditworthiness 
of the issuer and general market liquidity. 
High 
Yield/High Risk Securities/Junk Bonds. Certain Funds may invest in 
high yield securities, to varying degrees. High yield, high risk bonds are 
securities that are generally rated below investment grade by the primary rating 
agencies (BB+ or lower by S&P and Bal or lower by Moody’s) or unrated but 
determined by the Fund’s Adviser to be of comparable quality. Other terms used 
to describe such securities include “lower rated bonds,” “non-investment grade 
bonds,” “below investment grade bonds,” and “junk bonds.” These securities are 
considered to be high-risk investments. 
High yield securities are regarded 
as predominately speculative. There is a greater risk that issuers of lower 
rated securities will default than issuers of higher rated securities. Issuers 
of lower rated securities generally are less creditworthy and may be highly 
indebted, financially distressed, or bankrupt. These issuers are more vulnerable 
to real or perceived economic changes, political changes or adverse industry 
developments. In addition, high yield securities are frequently subordinated to 
the prior payment of senior indebtedness. If an issuer fails to pay principal or 
interest, a Fund would experience a decrease in income and a decline in the 
market value of its investments. A Fund may also incur additional expenses in 
seeking recovery from the issuer. 
The income and market value of lower 
rated securities may fluctuate more than higher rated securities. Non-investment grade securities are more 
sensitive to short-term corporate, economic and market developments. During 
periods of economic uncertainty and change, the market price of the investments 
in lower rated securities may be volatile. The default rate for high yield bonds 
tends to be cyclical, with defaults rising in periods of economic downturn. 

It is often more difficult to value 
lower rated securities than higher rated securities. If an issuer’s financial 
condition deteriorates, accurate financial and business information may be 
limited or unavailable. The lower rated investments may be thinly traded and 
there may be no established secondary market. Because of the lack of market 
pricing and current information for investments in lower rated securities, 
valuation of such investments is much more dependent on the judgment of the 
Adviser than is the case with higher rated securities. In addition, relatively 
few institutional purchasers may hold a major portion of an issue of lower-rated 
securities at times. As a result, a Fund that invests in lower rated securities 
may be required to sell investments at substantial losses or retain them 
indefinitely even where an issuer’s financial condition is deteriorating. 

Credit quality of non-investment grade securities can change 
suddenly and unexpectedly, and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully 
reflect the actual risks posed by a particular high-yield security. 
Future legislation may have a 
possible negative impact on the market for high yield, high risk bonds. As an 
example, in the late 1980’s, legislation required federally-insured savings and 
loan associations to divest their investments in high yield, high risk bonds. 
New legislation, if enacted, could have a material negative effect on a Fund’s 
investments in lower rated securities. 
Inflation-Linked Debt Securities. 
Inflation-linked securities include fixed and floating rate debt securities of 
varying maturities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies and 
instrumentalities, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (“TIPS”), as 
well as securities issued by other entities such as corporations, 
municipalities, foreign governments and foreign issuers, including foreign 
issuers from emerging markets. See also “Foreign Investments (including Foreign 
Currencies).” Typically, such securities are structured as fixed income 
investments whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate 
of inflation. The following two structures are common: (i) the U.S. 
Treasury and some other issuers issue inflation-linked securities that accrue 
inflation into the principal value of the security and (ii) other issuers 
may pay out the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) accruals as part of a semi-annual 
coupon. Other types of inflation-linked securities exist which use an inflation 
index other than the CPI. 
Inflation-linked securities issued 
by the U.S. Treasury, such as TIPS, have maturities of approximately five, ten 
or thirty years, although it is possible that securities with other maturities 
will be issued in the future. Typically, 
 
Part II - 5 


TIPS pay interest on a semi-annual 
basis equal to a fixed percentage of the inflation-adjusted principal amount. 
For example, if a Fund purchased an inflation-indexed bond with a par value of 
$1,000 and a 3% real rate of return coupon (payable 1.5% semi-annually), and the 
rate of inflation over the first six months was 1%, the mid-year par value of the bond would be 
$1,010 and the first semi-annual interest payment would be $15.15 ($1,010 times 
1.5%). If inflation during the second half of the year resulted in the whole 
year’s inflation of 3%, the end-of-year par value of the bond 
would be $1,030 and the second semi-annual interest payment would be $15.45 
($1,030 times 1.5%). 
If the periodic adjustment rate 
measuring inflation falls, the principal value of inflation-indexed bonds will 
be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable on these securities 
(calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount) will be reduced. 
Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for 
inflation) is guaranteed in the case of TIPS, even during a period of deflation, 
although the inflation-adjusted principal received could be less than the 
inflation-adjusted principal that had accrued to the bond at the time of 
purchase. However, the current market value of the bonds is not guaranteed and 
will fluctuate. Other inflation-related bonds exist which may or may not provide 
a similar guarantee. If a guarantee of principal is not provided, the adjusted 
principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the original 
principal. 
The value of inflation-linked 
securities is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. 
Real interest rates in turn are tied to the relationship between nominal 
interest rates and the rate of inflation. Therefore, if the rate of inflation 
rises at a faster rate than nominal interest rates, real interest rates might 
decline, leading to an increase in value of inflation-linked securities. 

While inflation-linked securities 
are expected to be protected from long-term inflationary trends, short-term 
increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value. If interest rates rise 
due to reasons other than inflation (for example, due to changes in currency 
exchange rates), investors in these securities may not be protected to the 
extent that the increase is not reflected in the bond’s inflation measure. 

The periodic adjustment of U.S. 
inflation-linked securities is tied to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban 
Consumers (“CPI-U”), which is not seasonably adjusted and which is calculated 
monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI-U is a measurement of changes in the cost 
of living, made up of components such as housing, food, transportation and 
energy. Inflation-linked securities issued by a foreign government are generally 
adjusted to reflect a comparable inflation index calculated by that government. 
There can be no assurance that the CPI-U or a foreign inflation index will 
accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and 
services. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the rate of inflation in a 
foreign country will be correlated to the rate of inflation in the U.S. 

Any increase in the principal amount 
of an inflation-linked security will be considered taxable ordinary income, even 
though investors do not receive their principal until maturity. 
Variable and Floating Rate Instruments. 
Certain obligations purchased by the Funds may carry variable or floating rates 
of interest, may involve a conditional or unconditional demand feature and may 
include variable amount master demand notes. Variable and floating rate 
instruments are issued by a wide variety of issuers and may be issued for a wide 
variety of purposes, including as a method of reconstructing cash flows. 

Subject to their investment 
objective policies and restrictions, certain Funds may acquire variable and 
floating rate instruments. A variable rate instrument is one whose terms provide 
for the adjustment of its interest rate on set dates and which, upon such 
adjustment, can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates 
its par value. Certain Funds may purchase extendable commercial notes. 
Extendable commercial notes are variable rate notes which normally mature within 
a short period of time (e.g., 1 month) but which may be extended by the issuer 
for a maximum maturity of thirteen months. 
A floating rate instrument is one 
whose terms provide for the adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified 
interest rate changes and which, at any time, can reasonably be expected to have 
a market value that approximates its par value. Floating rate instruments are 
frequently not rated by credit rating agencies; however, unrated variable and 
floating rate instruments purchased by a Fund will be determined by the Fund’s 
Adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase to rated instruments 
eligible for purchase under the Fund’s investment policies. In making such 
determinations, a Fund’s Adviser will consider the earning power, cash flow and 
other liquidity ratios of the issuers of such instruments (such issuers include 
financial, merchandising, bank holding and other companies) and will 
continuously monitor their financial condition. There may be no active secondary 
market with respect to a particular variable or floating rate instrument 
purchased by a Fund. The absence of such an active secondary market could make 
it difficult for the Fund to dispose of the variable or floating rate instrument 
involved in the event the issuer of the instrument defaulted on its payment 
obligations, and the Fund could, for this or other 
 
Part II - 6 


reasons, suffer a loss to the extent 
of the default. Variable or floating rate instruments may be secured by bank 
letters of credit or other assets. A Fund may purchase a variable or floating 
rate instrument to facilitate portfolio liquidity or to permit investment of the 
Fund’s assets at a favorable rate of return. 
As a result of the floating and 
variable rate nature of these investments, the Funds’ yields may decline, and 
they may forego the opportunity for capital appreciation during periods when 
interest rates decline; however, during periods when interest rates increase, 
the Funds’ yields may increase, and they may have reduced risk of capital 
depreciation. 
Past periods of high inflation, 
together with the fiscal measures adopted to attempt to deal with it, have seen 
wide fluctuations in interest rates, particularly “prime rates” charged by 
banks. While the value of the underlying floating or variable rate securities 
may change with changes in interest rates generally, the nature of the 
underlying floating or variable rate should minimize changes in value of the 
instruments. Accordingly, as interest rates decrease or increase, the potential 
for capital appreciation and the risk of potential capital depreciation is less 
than would be the case with a portfolio of fixed rate securities. A Fund’s 
portfolio may contain floating or variable rate securities on which stated 
minimum or maximum rates, or maximum rates set by state law limit the degree to 
which interest on such floating or variable rate securities may fluctuate; to 
the extent it does, increases or decreases in value may be somewhat greater than 
would be the case without such limits. Because the adjustment of interest rates 
on the floating or variable rate securities is made in relation to movements of 
the applicable banks’ “prime rates” or other short-term rate securities 
adjustment indices, the floating or variable rate securities are not comparable 
to long-term fixed rate securities. Accordingly, interest rates on the floating 
or variable rate securities may be higher or lower than current market rates for 
fixed rate obligations of comparable quality with similar maturities. 

Variable Amount Master Notes. 
Variable amount master notes are notes, which may possess a demand feature, that 
permit the indebtedness to vary and provide for periodic adjustments in the 
interest rate according to the terms of the instrument. Variable amount master 
notes may not be secured by collateral. To the extent that variable amount 
master notes are secured by collateral, they are subject to the risks described 
under the section “Loans—Collateral and Subordination Risk.” 
Because master notes are direct 
lending arrangements between a Fund and the issuer of the notes, they are not 
normally traded. Although there is no secondary market in the notes, a Fund may 
demand payment of principal and accrued interest. If the Fund is not repaid such 
principal and accrued interest, the Fund may not be able to dispose of the notes 
due to the lack of a secondary market. 
While master notes are not typically 
rated by credit rating agencies, issuers of variable amount master notes (which 
are normally manufacturing, retail, financial, brokerage, investment banking and 
other business concerns) must satisfy the same criteria as those set forth with 
respect to commercial paper, if any, in Part I of this SAI under the heading 
“Diversification”. A Fund’s Adviser will consider the credit risk of the issuers 
of such notes, including its earning power, cash flow, and other liquidity 
ratios of such issuers and will continuously monitor their financial status and 
ability to meet payment on demand. In determining average weighted portfolio 
maturity, a variable amount master note will be deemed to have a maturity equal 
to the period of time remaining until the principal amount can be recovered from 
the issuer. 
Variable Rate Instruments and 
Money Market Funds. Variable or floating rate instruments with stated 
maturities of more than 397 days may, under the SEC’s rule applicable to money 
market funds, Rule 2a-7 under the 
1940 Act, be deemed to have shorter maturities (other than in connection with 
the calculation of dollar-weighted average life to maturity of a portfolio) as 
follows: 
(1) Adjustable Rate Government 
Securities. A Government Security which is a variable rate security where 
the variable rate of interest is readjusted no less frequently than every 397 
days shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the 
next readjustment of the interest rate. A Government Security which is a 
floating rate security shall be deemed to have a remaining maturity of one day. 

(2) Short-Term Variable Rate 
Securities. A variable rate security, the principal amount of which, in 
accordance with the terms of the security, must unconditionally be paid in 397 
calendar days or less shall be deemed to have maturity equal to the earlier of 
the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the 
period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand. 

(3) Long-Term Variable Rate 
Securities. A variable rate security, the principal amount of which is 
scheduled to be paid in more than 397 days, that is subject to a demand feature 
shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the longer of the period remaining 
until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until 
the principal amount can be recovered through demand. 
 
Part II - 7 


(4) Short-Term Floating Rate 
Securities. A floating rate security, the principal amount of which, in 
accordance with the terms of the security, must unconditionally be paid in 397 
calendar days or less shall be deemed to have a maturity of one day. 
(5) Long-Term Floating Rate 
Securities. A floating rate security, the principal amount of which is 
scheduled to be paid in more than 397 days, that is subject to a demand feature, 
shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the 
principal amount can be recovered through demand. 
Limitations on the Use of 
Variable and Floating Rate Notes. Variable and floating rate instruments for 
which no readily available market exists (e.g., illiquid securities) will be 
purchased in an amount which, together with securities with legal or contractual 
restrictions on resale or for which no readily available market exists 
(including repurchase agreements providing for settlement more than seven days 
after notice), exceeds 15% of a Fund’s net assets (5% of total assets for the 
J.P. Morgan Funds which are money market funds (the “Money Market Funds”)) only 
if such instruments are subject to a demand feature that will permit the Fund to 
demand payment of the principal within seven days after demand by the Fund. 
There is no limit on the extent to which a Fund may purchase demand instruments 
that are not illiquid or deemed to be liquid in accordance with the Adviser’s 
liquidity determination procedures (except, with regard to the Money Market 
Funds, as provided under Rule 2a-7). If 
not rated, such instruments must be found by the Fund’s Adviser to be of 
comparable quality to instruments in which a Fund may invest. A rating may be 
relied upon only if it is provided by an NRSRO that is not affiliated with the 
issuer or guarantor of the instruments. 
Zero-Coupon, Pay-in-Kind and Deferred Payment 
Securities. Zero-coupon securities are securities that are sold at a 
discount to par value and on which interest payments are not made during the 
life of the security. Upon maturity, the holder is entitled to receive the par 
value of the security. Pay-in-kind securities are securities 
that have interest payable by delivery of additional securities. Upon maturity, 
the holder is entitled to receive the aggregate par value of the securities. A 
Fund accrues income with respect to zero-coupon and pay-in-kind securities prior to the 
receipt of cash payments. Deferred payment securities are securities that remain 
zero-coupon securities until a predetermined date, at which time the stated 
coupon rate becomes effective and interest becomes payable at regular intervals. 
While interest payments are not made on such securities, holders of such 
securities are deemed to have received “phantom income.” Because a Fund will 
distribute “phantom income” to shareholders, to the extent that shareholders 
elect to receive dividends in cash rather than reinvesting such dividends in 
additional shares, the applicable Fund will have fewer assets with which to 
purchase income-producing securities. Zero-coupon, pay-in-kind and deferred payment 
securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and lesser liquidity 
in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities 
paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods. 
Impact of Market Conditions on the Risks associated 
with Debt Securities 
Investments in certain debt 
securities will be especially subject to the risk that, during certain periods, 
the liquidity of particular issuers or industries, or all securities within a 
particular investment category, may shrink or disappear suddenly and without 
warning as a result of adverse economic, market or political events, or adverse 
investor perceptions, whether or not accurate. 
Current market conditions pose 
heightened risks for Funds that invest in debt securities. While the U.S. is 
experiencing historically low interest rate levels, signs of economic recovery 
and the end of the Federal Reserve Board’s quantitative easing program have 
increased the risk that interest rates may rise in the near future. Any future 
interest rate increases or other adverse conditions (e.g., 
inflation/deflation, increased selling of certain fixed-income investments 
across other pooled investment vehicles or accounts, changes in investor 
perception, or changes in government intervention in the markets) could cause 
the value of any Fund that invests in debt securities to decrease. As such, debt 
securities markets may experience heightened levels of interest rate and 
liquidity risk, as well as increased volatility. If rising interest rates cause 
a Fund to lose value, the Fund could also face increased shareholder 
redemptions, which would further impair the Fund’s ability to achieve its 
investment objectives. 
The capacity for traditional dealers 
to engage in fixed-income trading for certain fixed income instruments has not 
kept pace with the growth of the fixed income market, and in some cases has 
decreased. As a result, because dealers acting as market makers provide 
stability to a market, the significant reduction in certain dealer inventories 
could potentially lead to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the 
fixed income markets. Such issues may be exacerbated during periods of economic 
uncertainty or market volatility. 
Demand Features 
Certain Funds may acquire securities 
that are subject to puts and standby commitments (“Demand Features”) to purchase 
the securities at their principal amount (usually with accrued interest) within 
a fixed period (usually seven 
 
Part II - 8 


days) following a demand by the 
Fund. The Demand Feature may be issued by the issuer of the underlying 
securities, a dealer in the securities or by another third party and may not be 
transferred separately from the underlying security. The underlying securities 
subject to a put may be sold at any time at market rates. Applicable Funds 
expect that they will acquire puts only where the puts are available without the 
payment of any direct or indirect consideration. However, if advisable or 
necessary, a premium may be paid for put features. A premium paid will have the 
effect of reducing the yield otherwise payable on the underlying security. 
Demand Features provided by foreign banks involve certain risks associated with 
foreign investments. See “Foreign Investments (including Foreign Currencies)” 
for more information on these risks. 
Under a “stand-by commitment,” a dealer would agree 
to purchase, at a Fund’s option, specified securities at a specified price. A 
Fund will acquire these commitments solely to facilitate portfolio liquidity and 
does not intend to exercise its rights thereunder for trading purposes. Stand-by commitments may also be referred to 
as put options. 
The purpose of engaging in 
transactions involving puts is to maintain flexibility and liquidity to permit a 
Fund to meet redemption requests and remain as fully invested as possible. 

Equity Securities, Warrants and Rights 
Common Stock. Common stock represents a 
share of ownership in a company and usually carries voting rights and may earn 
dividends. Unlike preferred stock, common stock dividends are not fixed but are 
declared at the discretion of the issuer’s board of directors. Common stock 
occupies the most junior position in a company’s capital structure. As with all 
equity securities, the price of common stock fluctuates based on changes in a 
company’s financial condition, including those that result from management’s 
performance or changes to the business of the company, and overall market and 
economic conditions. 
Common Stock Warrants and Rights. Common 
stock warrants entitle the holder to buy common stock from the issuer of the 
warrant at a specific price (the “strike price”) for a specific period of time. 
The market price of warrants may be substantially lower than the current market 
price of the underlying common stock, yet warrants are subject to similar price 
fluctuations. As a result, warrants may be more volatile investments than the 
underlying common stock. If a warrant is exercised, a Fund may hold common stock 
in its portfolio even if it does not ordinarily invest in common stock. 

Rights are similar to warrants but 
normally have a shorter duration and are typically distributed directly by the 
issuers to existing shareholders, while warrants are typically attached to new 
debt or preferred stock issuances. 
Warrants and rights generally do not 
entitle the holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying 
common stock and do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer 
company. Warrants and rights will expire if not exercised on or prior to the 
expiration date. 
Preferred Stock. Preferred stock is a class 
of stock that generally pays dividends at a specified rate and has preference 
over common stock in the payment of dividends and liquidation. Preferred stock 
generally does not carry voting rights. As with all equity securities, the price 
of preferred stock fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial 
condition and on overall market and economic conditions. Because preferred 
stocks generally pay dividends only after the issuing company makes required 
payments to holders of its bonds and other debt, the value of preferred stocks 
is more sensitive than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in 
the company’s financial condition or prospects. 
Initial Public Offerings (“IPOs”). The Funds 
may purchase securities in IPOs. These securities are subject to many of the 
same risks as investing in companies with smaller market capitalizations. 
Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the 
companies may be available for very limited periods. The prices of securities 
sold in IPOs may be highly volatile. At any particular time or from time to 
time, a Fund may not be able to invest in securities issued in IPOs, or invest 
to the extent desired, because, for example, only a small portion (if any) of 
the securities being offered in an IPO may be made available to the Fund. In 
addition, under certain market conditions, a relatively small number of 
companies may issue securities in IPOs. Similarly, as the number of Funds to 
which IPO securities are allocated increases, the number of securities issued to 
any one Fund may decrease. The investment performance of a Fund during periods 
when it is unable to invest significantly or at all in IPOs may be lower than 
during periods when the Fund is able to do so. In addition, as a Fund increases 
in size, the impact of IPOs on the Fund’s performance will generally decrease. 

Foreign Investments (including Foreign Currencies) 

Some of the Funds may invest in 
certain obligations or securities of foreign issuers. For purposes of a non-Money Market Fund’s investment policies 
and unless described otherwise in a Fund’s prospectus, an issuer of a 

 
Part II - 9 


security will be deemed to be 
located in a particular country if: (i) the principal trading market for 
the security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the 
laws of such country or (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its 
revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its total assets 
situated in such country. Possible investments include equity securities and 
debt securities (e.g., bonds and commercial paper) of foreign entities, 
obligations of foreign branches of U.S. banks and of foreign banks, including, 
without limitation, eurodollar certificates of deposit, eurodollar time 
deposits, eurodollar bankers’ acceptances, canadian time deposits and yankee 
certificates of deposit, and investments in canadian commercial paper, and 
europaper. Securities of foreign issuers may include sponsored and unsponsored 
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”), 
and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”). Sponsored ADRs are listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange; unsponsored ADRs are not. Therefore, there may be less 
information available about the issuers of unsponsored ADRs than the issuers of 
sponsored ADRs. Unsponsored ADRs are restricted securities. EDRs and GDRs are 
not listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As a result, it may be difficult to 
obtain information about EDRs and GDRs. 
The Money Market Funds may only 
invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities. 
Risk 
Factors of Foreign Investments. The following is a summary of certain risks 
associated with foreign investments: 
Political and Exchange Risks. 
Foreign investments may subject a Fund to investment risks that differ in 
some respects from those related to investments in obligations of U.S. domestic 
issuers. Such risks include potential future adverse political and economic 
developments, sanctions or other measures by the United States or other 
governments, possible imposition of withholding taxes on interest or other 
income, possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of foreign deposits, 
possible establishment of exchange controls or taxation at the source, greater 
fluctuations in value due to changes in exchange rates, or the adoption of other 
foreign governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment of 
principal and interest on such obligations. 
Higher Transaction Costs. 
Foreign investments may entail higher custodial fees and sales commissions 
than domestic investments. 
Accounting and Regulatory 
Differences. Foreign issuers of securities or obligations are often subject 
to accounting treatment and engage in business practices different from those of 
domestic issuers of similar securities or obligations. In addition, foreign 
issuers are usually not subject to the same degree of regulation as domestic 
issuers, and their securities may trade on relatively small markets, causing 
their securities to experience potentially higher volatility and more limited 
liquidity than securities of domestic issuers. Foreign branches of U.S. banks 
and foreign banks are not regulated by U.S. banking authorities and may be 
subject to less stringent reserve requirements than those applicable to domestic 
branches of U.S. banks. In addition, foreign banks generally are not bound by 
accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards comparable to those 
applicable to U.S. banks. Dividends and interest paid by foreign issuers may be 
subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may decrease the net return 
on foreign investments as compared to dividends and interest paid to a Fund by 
domestic companies. 
Currency Risk. Foreign 
securities may be denominated in foreign currencies, although foreign issuers 
may also issue securities denominated in U.S. dollars. The value of a Fund’s 
investments denominated in foreign currencies and any funds held in foreign 
currencies will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates, the relative 
strength of those currencies and the U.S. dollar, and exchange-control 
regulations. Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates also may affect the 
value of dividends and interest earned, gains and losses realized on the sale of 
securities and net investment income and gains, if any, to be distributed to 
shareholders by a Fund. The exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other 
currencies are determined by the forces of supply and demand in foreign exchange 
markets and the relative merits of investments in different countries, actual or 
anticipated changes in interest rates and other complex factors, as seen from an 
international perspective. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly 
over short periods of time. Currency exchange rates also can be affected by 
intervention (or lack of intervention) by the United States or foreign 
governments or central banks or by currency controls or political developments 
in the United States or elsewhere. 
Accordingly, the ability of a Fund 
that invests in foreign securities as part of its principal investment strategy 
to achieve its investment objective may depend, to a certain extent, on exchange 
rate movements. In addition, while the volume of transactions effected on 
foreign stock exchanges has increased in recent years, in most cases it remains 
appreciably below that of domestic securities exchanges. Accordingly, a Fund’s 
foreign investments may be less liquid and their prices may be more volatile 
than comparable investments in securities of U.S. companies. In buying and 
selling securities on foreign exchanges, purchasers normally pay fixed 
commissions that are generally 
 
Part II - 10 


higher than the negotiated 
commissions charged in the U.S. In addition, there is generally less government 
supervision and regulation of securities exchanges, brokers and issuers located 
in foreign countries than in the U.S. 
Settlement Risk. The 
settlement periods for foreign securities and instruments are often longer than 
those for securities or obligations of U.S. issuers or instruments denominated 
in U.S. dollars. Delayed settlement may affect the liquidity of a Fund’s 
holdings. Certain types of securities and other instruments are not traded 
“delivery versus payment” in certain markets (e.g., government bonds in Russia) 
meaning that a Fund may deliver securities or instruments before payment is 
received from the counterparty. In such markets, the Fund may not receive timely 
payment for securities or other instruments it has delivered and may be subject 
to increased risk that the counterparty will fail to make payments when due or 
default completely. 
Brady 
Bonds. Brady bonds are securities created through the exchange of existing 
commercial bank loans to public and private entities in certain emerging markets 
for new bonds in connection with debt restructurings. Brady bonds have been 
issued since 1989. In light of the history of defaults of countries issuing 
Brady bonds on their commercial bank loans, investments in Brady bonds may be 
viewed as speculative and subject to the same risks as emerging market 
securities. Brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or 
uncollateralized, are issued in various currencies (but primarily the U.S. 
dollar) and are actively traded in over-the-counter (“OTC”) secondary 
markets. Incomplete collateralization of interest or principal payment 
obligations results in increased credit risk. Dollar-denominated collateralized 
Brady bonds, which may be either fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are 
generally collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. 
Global Depositary Notes. Foreign securities 
and emerging markets securities include Global Depositary Notes (“GDNs”). A GDN 
is a debt instrument created by a bank that evidences ownership of local 
currency-denominated debt securities. GDNs reflect the terms of particular local 
currency-denominated bonds. GDNs trade, settle, and pay interest and principal 
in U.S. dollars but typically are restricted securities that do not trade on an 
exchange. Any distributions paid to the holders of GDNs are usually subject to a 
fee charged by the depositary bank. In addition to the risks associated with 
foreign investments, a Fund’s investments in GDNs is subject to the risks 
associated with the underlying local currency-denominated bond and derivative 
instruments including credit risk, default or similar event risk, counterparty 
risk, interest rate risk, leverage risk, liquidity risk, and management risk. 
Holders of GDNs may have limited rights, and investment restrictions in certain 
countries may adversely impact the value of GDNs because such restrictions may 
limit the ability to convert the bonds into GDNs and vice versa. Such 
restrictions may cause bonds of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or 
premium to the market price of the GDN. 
Obligations of Supranational Entities. Obligations 
of supranational entities include securities designated or supported by 
governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development of 
international banking institutions and related government agencies. Examples 
include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the “World 
Bank”), the European Coal and Steel Community, the Asian Development Bank and 
the Inter-American Development Bank. Each supranational entity’s lending 
activities are limited to a percentage of its total capital (including “callable 
capital” contributed by its governmental members at the entity’s call), reserves 
and net income. There is no assurance that participating governments will be 
able or willing to honor their commitments to make capital contributions to a 
supranational entity. 
Sukuk. Foreign securities and emerging market 
securities include Sukuk. Sukuk are certificates, similar to bonds, issued by 
the issuer to obtain an upfront payment in exchange for an income stream to be 
generated by certain assets of the issuer. Generally, the issuer sells the 
investor a certificate, which the investor then rents back to the issuer for a 
predetermined rental fee. The issuer also makes a contractual promise to buy 
back the certificate at a future date at par value. While the certificate is 
linked to the returns generated by certain assets of the issuer, the underlying 
assets are not pledged as security for the certificates, and the Fund (as the 
investor) is relying on the creditworthiness of the issuer for all payments 
required by the sukuk. Issuers of sukuk may include international financial 
institutions, foreign governments and agencies of foreign governments. 
Underlying assets may include, without limitation, real estate (developed and 
undeveloped), lease contracts and machinery and equipment. 
Emerging Market Securities. Investing in companies 
domiciled in emerging market countries may be subject to potentially higher 
risks than investments in developed countries. These risks include: 
(i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater 
illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets 
for such securities, or low non-existent trading volumes; (iii) less 
scrutiny and regulation by local authorities of the foreign exchanges and 
broker-dealers; (iv) the seizure or confiscation by local governments of 
securities held by foreign investors, and the possible suspension or limiting by 
local governments of an issuer’s ability to make dividend or interest payments; 
(v) limiting or entirely restricting repatriation of invested capital, 
profits, and dividends by local governments; (vi) possible local taxation 
of capital gains, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) the attempt by 
issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local 
governments to make dividend or interest 
 
Part II - 11 


payments to foreign investors in the 
local currency; (viii) difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the 
securities and/or local judges favoring the interests of the issuer over those 
of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy judgments being paid in the local 
currency; (x) greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the 
securities due to limited public information regarding the issuer, and 
(xi) difficulty of ascertaining the financial health of an issuer due to 
lax financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and 
differences in accounting standards. 
Emerging country securities markets 
are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and 
trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of 
industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a 
limited number of investors. Although some emerging markets have become more 
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets 
for securities in other emerging countries are in the earliest stages of their 
development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. 
Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging countries 
may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in 
trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional 
investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of 
many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons 
apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the 
securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who 
control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and 
arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may 
contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The 
limited liquidity of emerging country securities may also affect a Fund’s 
ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of 
securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet 
redemption requests. 
Many emerging market countries 
suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation 
may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any 
precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may 
be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes 
in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors, 
such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. 
Certain emerging market countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of 
private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be 
no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future. 
Foreign investment in the securities 
markets of certain emerging countries is restricted or controlled to varying 
degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund’s investment in certain emerging 
countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging countries 
require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit 
investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer’s 
outstanding securities or to a specific class of securities, which may have less 
advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available 
for purchase by nationals. 
Many developing countries lack the 
social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political 
instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by 
an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and 
religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take 
the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, 
including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or 
underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, 
including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers. 

Currencies of emerging market 
countries are subject to significantly greater risks than currencies of 
developed countries. Many emerging market countries have experienced steady 
declines or even sudden devaluations of their currencies relative to the U.S. 
dollar. Some emerging market currencies may not be internationally traded or may 
be subject to strict controls by local governments, resulting in undervalued or 
overvalued currencies. 
Some emerging market countries have 
experienced balance of payment deficits and shortages in foreign exchange 
reserves. Governments have responded by restricting currency conversions. Future 
restrictive exchange controls could prevent or restrict a company’s ability to 
make dividend or interest payments in the original currency of the obligation 
(usually U.S. dollars). In addition, even though the currencies of some emerging 
market countries may be convertible into U.S. dollars, the conversion rates may 
be artificial to their actual market values. 
A Fund’s income and, in some cases, 
capital gains from foreign stocks and securities will be subject to applicable 
taxation in certain of the countries in which it invests, and treaties between 
the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the 
otherwise applicable tax rates. Foreign markets also have different clearance 
and settlement procedures, and in certain markets there have been times when 
settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities 
transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions. Such delays in 
settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of a 
Fund remains uninvested and no return is earned on such assets. The inability of 
the Fund to make intended security purchases or sales due to settlement problems 
could result either in losses to the Fund due to subsequent declines in value of 
the portfolio 
 
Part II - 12 


securities, in the Fund deeming 
those securities to be illiquid, or, if the Fund has entered into a contract to 
sell the securities, in possible liability to the purchaser. 
In the past, governments within the 
emerging markets have become overly reliant on the international capital markets 
and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs 
which cause huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too 
overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total 
gross domestic product (“GDP”). These foreign obligations have become the 
subject of political debate and have served as fuel for political parties of the 
opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign 
creditors, but instead to use these funds for social programs. Either due to an 
inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have 
been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have 
declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These 
events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign 
governments and corporations domiciled in emerging market countries and have 
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to 
borrow in the future as well. 
Sovereign Obligations. Sovereign debt includes 
investments in securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government 
or its agencies, authorities or political subdivisions. An investment in 
sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt 
obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt or the governmental authorities 
that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay 
principal or interest when due, and a Fund may have limited recourse in the 
event of a default. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of 
sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations. In the 
past, certain emerging markets have encountered difficulties in servicing their 
debt obligations, withheld payments of principal and interest and declared 
moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. 

A sovereign debtor’s willingness or 
ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected 
by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its foreign 
currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative 
size of the debt service burden, the sovereign debtor’s policy toward principal 
international lenders and local political constraints. Sovereign debtors may 
also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, 
multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce principal and interest 
arrearages on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor to implement 
economic reforms, achieve specified levels of economic performance or repay 
principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of third-party 
commitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor, which may further impair such 
debtor’s ability or willingness to service its debts. 
Foreign Currency Transactions. Certain Funds may 
engage in foreign currency transactions which include the following, some of 
which also have been described elsewhere in this SAI: options on currencies, 
currency futures, options on such futures, forward foreign currency 
transactions, forward rate agreements and currency swaps, caps and floors. 
Certain Funds may engage in such transactions in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. To the extent a Fund enters 
into such transactions in markets other than in the U.S., the Fund may be 
subject to certain currency, settlement, liquidity, trading and other risks 
similar to those described above with respect to the Fund’s investments in 
foreign securities including emerging markets securities. Certain Funds may 
engage in such transactions to hedge against currency risks, as a substitute for 
securities in which the Fund invests, to increase or decrease exposure to a 
foreign currency, to shift exposure from one foreign currency to another, for 
risk management purposes or to increase income or gain to the Fund. To the 
extent that a Fund uses foreign currency transactions for hedging purposes, the 
Fund may hedge either specific transactions or portfolio positions. 
While a Fund’s use of hedging 
strategies is intended to reduce the volatility of the net asset value of Fund 
shares, the net asset value of the Fund will fluctuate. There can be no 
assurance that a Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective. Furthermore, a 
Fund may only engage in hedging activities from time to time and may not 
necessarily be engaging in hedging activities when movements in currency 
exchange rates occur. 
Certain Funds are authorized to deal 
in forward foreign exchange between currencies of the different countries in 
which the Fund will invest and multi-national currency units as a hedge against 
possible variations in the foreign exchange rate between these currencies. This 
is accomplished through contractual agreements entered into in the interbank 
market to purchase or sell one specified currency for another currency at a 
specified future date (up to one year) and price at the time of the contract. 

Transaction Hedging. 
Generally, when a Fund engages in transaction hedging, it enters into 
foreign currency transactions with respect to specific receivables or payables 
of the Fund generally arising in connection with the purchase or sale of its 
portfolio securities. A Fund may engage in transaction hedging when it desires 
to “lock in” 
 
Part II - 13 


the U.S. dollar price (or a non-U.S. dollar currency (“reference 
currency”)) of a security it has agreed to purchase or sell, or the U.S. dollar 
equivalent of a dividend or interest payment in a foreign currency. By 
transaction hedging, a Fund attempts to protect itself against a possible loss 
resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between the U.S. dollar or 
other reference currency and the applicable foreign currency during the period 
between the date on which the security is purchased or sold, or on which the 
dividend or interest payment is declared, and the date on which such payments 
are made or received. 
A Fund may purchase or sell a 
foreign currency on a spot (or cash) basis at the prevailing spot rate in 
connection with the settlement of transactions in portfolio securities 
denominated in that foreign currency. Certain Funds reserve the right to 
purchase and sell foreign currency futures contracts traded in the U.S. and 
subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). 

For transaction hedging purposes, a 
Fund may also purchase U.S. exchange-listed call and put options on foreign 
currency futures contracts and on foreign currencies. A put option on a futures 
contract gives a Fund the right to assume a short position in the foreign 
currency futures contract until expiration of the option. A put option on 
currency gives a Fund the right to sell a currency at an exercise price until 
the expiration of the option. A call option on a futures contract gives a Fund 
the right to assume a long position in the futures contract until the expiration 
of the option. A call option on currency gives a Fund the right to purchase a 
currency at the exercise price until the expiration of the option. 
Position Hedging. When 
engaging in position hedging, a Fund will enter into foreign currency exchange 
transactions to protect against a decline in the values of the foreign 
currencies in which their portfolio securities are denominated or an increase in 
the value of currency for securities which a Fund’s Adviser expects to purchase. 
In connection with the position hedging, the Fund may purchase or sell foreign 
currency forward contracts or foreign currency on a spot basis. A Fund may 
purchase U.S. exchange-listed put or call options on foreign currency and 
foreign currency futures contracts and buy or sell foreign currency futures 
contracts traded in the U.S. and subject to regulation by the CFTC. 
The precise matching of the amounts 
of foreign currency exchange transactions and the value of the portfolio 
securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of 
such securities in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market 
movements in the value of those securities between the dates the currency 
exchange transactions are entered into and the dates they mature. 
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange 
Contracts. Certain Funds may purchase forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts, sometimes referred to as “currency forwards” (“Forward Contracts”), 
which involve an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future 
date, which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract as 
agreed by the parties in an amount and at a price set at the time of the 
contract. In the case of a cancelable Forward Contract, the holder has the 
unilateral right to cancel the contract at maturity by paying a specified fee. 
The contracts are traded in the interbank market conducted directly between 
currency traders (usually large commercial banks) and their customers, so no 
intermediary is required. A Forward Contract generally has no deposit 
requirement, and no commissions are charged at any stage for trades. 
At the maturity of a Forward 
Contract, a Fund may either accept or make delivery of the currency specified in 
the contract or, at or prior to maturity, enter into a closing transaction 
involving the purchase or sale of an offsetting contract. Closing transactions 
with respect to forward contracts are usually effected with the currency trader 
who is a party to the original forward contract. For forward foreign currency 
contracts (other than Non-Deliverable Forwards) that require physical 
settlement, the Funds will segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the 
current notional value of each contract. In calculating the notional value, the 
Funds may net long and short contracts with the same currency and the same 
settlement date. With respect to trades that do not settle through CLS Bank 
International, the Funds may only net long and short contracts if the contracts 
are with the same counterparty. Certain Funds may also engage in non-deliverable forwards which are cash 
settled and which do not involve delivery of the currency specified in the 
contract. For more information on Non-Deliverable Forwards, see 
“Non-Deliverable Forwards” below. 
Foreign Currency Futures 
Contracts. Certain Funds may purchase foreign currency futures contracts. 
Foreign currency futures contracts traded in the U.S. are designed by and traded 
on exchanges regulated by the CFTC, such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. A 
Fund may enter into foreign currency futures contracts for hedging purposes and 
other risk management purposes as defined in CFTC regulations. Certain Funds may 
also enter into foreign currency futures transactions to increase exposure to a 
foreign currency, to shift exposure from one foreign currency to another or to 
increase income or gain to the Fund. 
 
Part II - 14 


At the maturity of a futures 
contract, the Fund may either accept or make delivery of the currency specified 
in the contract, or at or prior to maturity enter into a closing transaction 
involving the purchase or sale of an offsetting contract. Closing transactions 
with respect to futures contracts are effected on a commodities exchange; a 
clearing corporation associated with the exchange assumes responsibility for 
closing out such contracts. 
Positions in the foreign currency 
futures contracts may be closed out only on an exchange or board of trade which 
provides a secondary market in such contracts. There is no assurance that a 
secondary market on an exchange or board of trade will exist for any particular 
contract or at any particular time. In such event, it may not be possible to 
close a futures position; in the event of adverse price movements, the Fund 
would continue to be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin. 

For more information on futures 
contracts, see “Futures Contracts” under the heading “Options and Futures 
Transactions” below. 
Foreign Currency Options. 
Certain Funds may purchase and sell U.S. exchange-listed and over the 
counter call and put options on foreign currencies. Such options on foreign 
currencies operate similarly to options on securities. When a Fund purchases a 
put option, the Fund has the right but not the obligation to exchange money 
denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date. 
When a Fund sells or writes a call option, the Fund has the obligation to 
exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate if the buyer 
exercises option. Some of the Funds may also purchase and sell non-deliverable currency options 
(“Non-Deliverable Options”). Non-Deliverable Options are cash-settled, 
options on foreign currencies (each a “Option Reference Currency”) that are 
non-convertible and that may be thinly 
traded or illiquid. Non-Deliverable 
Options involve an obligation to pay an amount in a deliverable currency (such 
as U.S. Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, or British Pounds Sterling) equal to the 
difference between the prevailing market exchange rate for the Option Reference 
Currency and the agreed upon exchange rate (the “Non-Deliverable Option Rate”), 
with respect to an agreed notional amount. Options on foreign currencies are 
affected by all of those factors which influence foreign exchange rates and 
investments generally. 
A Fund is authorized to purchase or 
sell listed foreign currency options and currency swap contracts as a short or 
long hedge against possible variations in foreign exchange rates, as a 
substitute for securities in which a Fund may invest, and for risk management 
purposes. Such transactions may be effected with respect to hedges on non-U.S. dollar denominated securities 
(including securities denominated in the Euro) owned by the Fund, sold by the 
Fund but not yet delivered, committed or anticipated to be purchased by the 
Fund, or in transaction or cross-hedging strategies. As an illustration, a Fund 
may use such techniques to hedge the stated value in U.S. dollars of an 
investment in a Japanese yen-dominated 
security. In such circumstances, the Fund may purchase a foreign currency put 
option enabling it to sell a specified amount of yen for dollars at a specified 
price by a future date. To the extent the hedge is successful, a loss in the 
value of the dollar relative to the yen will tend to be offset by an increase in 
the value of the put option. To offset, in whole or in part, the cost of 
acquiring such a put option, the Fund also may sell a call option which, if 
exercised, requires it to sell a specified amount of yen for dollars at a 
specified price by a future date (a technique called a “collar”). By selling the 
call option in this illustration, the Fund gives up the opportunity to profit 
without limit from increases in the relative value of the yen to the dollar. 
Certain Funds may also enter into foreign currency futures transactions for 
non-hedging purposes including to 
increase or decrease exposure to a foreign currency, to shift exposure from one 
foreign currency to another or to increase income or gain to the Fund. 

Certain differences exist among 
these foreign currency instruments. Foreign currency options provide the holder 
thereof the right to buy or to sell a currency at a fixed price on a future 
date. Listed options are third-party contracts (i.e., performance of the 
parties’ obligations is guaranteed by an exchange or clearing corporation) which 
are issued by a clearing corporation, traded on an exchange and have 
standardized strike prices and expiration dates. OTC options are two-party contracts and have negotiated 
strike prices and expiration dates. Options on futures contracts are traded on 
boards of trade or futures exchanges. Currency swap contracts are negotiated 
two-party agreements entered into in 
the interbank market whereby the parties exchange two foreign currencies at the 
inception of the contract and agree to reverse the exchange at a specified 
future time and at a specified exchange rate. 
The JPMorgan Emerging Markets Debt 
Fund may also purchase and sell barrier/“touch” options (“Barrier Options”), 
including knock-in options (“Knock-In Options”) and knock-out options (“Knock-Out Options”). A Barrier Option is a 
type of exotic option that gives an investor a payout once the price of the 
underlying currency reaches or surpasses (or falls below) a predetermined 
barrier. This type of option allows the buyer of the option to set the position 
of the barrier, the length of time until expiration and the payout to be 
received once the barrier is broken. There are two kinds of Knock-In Options, (i) “up and in” and 
(ii) “down and in”. With Knock-In 
Options, if the buyer has selected an upper price barrier, and the currency hits 
that level, the Knock-In Option turns 
into a more traditional option (“Vanilla Option”) whereby the owner has the 
right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into 
another currency at a pre-agreed 
exchange rate on a specified date. This type of 
 
Part II - 15 


Knock-In Option is called “up and in”. The 
“down and in” Knock-In Option is the 
same as the “up and in”, except the currency has to reach a lower barrier. Upon 
hitting the chosen lower price level, the “down and in” Knock-In Option turns into a Vanilla Option. 
As in the Knock-In Option, there are 
two kinds of Knock-Out Options, ( i) 
“up and out” and (ii) “down and out”. However, in a Knock-Out Option, the buyer begins with a 
Vanilla Option, and if the predetermined price barrier is hit, the Vanilla 
Option is cancelled and the seller has no further obligation. If the option hits 
the upper barrier, the option is cancelled and the investor loses the premium 
paid, thus, “up and out”. If the option hits the lower price barrier, the option 
is cancelled, thus, “down and out”. Barrier Options usually call for delivery of 
the underlying currency. 
The value of a foreign currency 
option is dependent upon the value of the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar 
and may have no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security. 
Because foreign currency transactions occurring in the interbank market involve 
substantially larger amounts than those that may be involved in the use of 
foreign currency options, investors may be disadvantaged by having to deal in an 
odd lot market (generally consisting of transactions of less than $1 million) 
for the underlying foreign currencies at prices that are less favorable than 
those for round lots. 
There is no systematic reporting of 
last sale information for foreign currencies and there is no regulatory 
requirement that quotations available through dealer or other market sources be 
firm or revised on a timely basis. Available quotation information is generally 
representative of very large transactions in the interbank market and thus may 
not reflect relatively smaller transactions (less than $1 million) where rates 
may be less favorable. The interbank market in foreign currencies is a global, 
around-the-clock market. To the extent 
that the U.S. options markets are closed while the markets for the underlying 
currencies remain open, significant price and rate movements may take place in 
the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options market. 

In addition to writing call options 
on currencies when a Fund owns the underlying currency, the Funds may also write 
call options on currencies even if they do not own the underlying currency as 
long as the Fund segregates cash or liquid assets that, when added to the 
amounts deposited with a futures commission merchant or a broker as margin, 
equal the market value of the currency underlying the call option (but not less 
than the strike price of the call option). The Funds may also cover a written 
call option by owning a separate call option permitting the Fund to purchase the 
reference currency at a price no higher than the strike price of the call option 
sold by the Fund. In addition, a Fund may write a non-deliverable call option if the Fund 
segregates an amount equal to the current notional value (amount obligated to 
pay). Netting is generally permitted of long and short positions of a specific 
country (assuming long and short contracts are similar). If there are securities 
or currency held in that specific country at least equal to the current notional 
value of the net currency positions, no segregation is required. 
Non-Deliverable Forwards.
Some of the Funds may also invest in non-deliverable forwards (“NDFs”). NDFs are 
cash-settled, short-term forward contracts on foreign currencies (each a 
“Reference Currency”) that are non-convertible and that may be thinly traded 
or illiquid. NDFs involve an obligation to pay an amount (the “Settlement 
Amount”) equal to the difference between the prevailing market exchange rate for 
the Reference Currency and the agreed upon exchange rate (the “NDF Rate”), with 
respect to an agreed notional amount. NDFs have a fixing date and a settlement 
(delivery) date. The fixing date is the date and time at which the 
difference between the prevailing market exchange rate and the agreed upon 
exchange rate is calculated. The settlement (delivery) date is the date by which 
the payment of the Settlement Amount is due to the party receiving payment. 

Although NDFs are similar to forward 
foreign currency exchange contracts, NDFs do not require physical delivery of 
the Reference Currency on the settlement date. Rather, on the settlement date, 
the only transfer between the counterparties is the monetary settlement amount 
representing the difference between the NDF Rate and the prevailing market 
exchange rate. NDFs typically may have terms from one month up to two years 
and are settled in U.S. dollars.
NDFs are subject to many of the 
risks associated with derivatives in general and forward currency transactions 
including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency and the risk 
that the counterparty will fail to fulfill its obligations. The Funds will 
segregate or earmark liquid assets in an amount equal to the marked to market 
value, on a daily basis of the NDF. In calculating the mark-to-market value, the 
Funds may net opposing NDF contracts with the same currency and the same 
settlement date. With respect to trades that do not settle through CLS Bank 
International, the Funds may only net opposing NDF contracts if the contracts 
are with the same counterparty. 
The Funds will typically use NDFs 
for hedging purposes, but may also, use such instruments to increase income or 
gain. The use of NDFs for hedging or to increase income or gain may not be 
successful, resulting in losses to the Fund, and the cost of such strategies may 
reduce the Funds’ respective returns. 
Foreign Currency Conversion. 
Although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for currency 
conversion, they do realize a profit based on the difference (the “spread”) 
between prices at which they are buying and selling 
 
Part II - 16 


various currencies. Thus, a dealer 
may offer to sell a foreign currency to a Fund at one rate while offering a 
lesser rate of exchange should the Fund desire to resell that currency to the 
dealer. 
Other Foreign Currency Hedging 
Strategies. New options and futures contracts and other financial products, 
and various combinations thereof, continue to be developed, and certain Funds 
may invest in any such options, contracts and products as may be developed to 
the extent consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and the regulatory 
requirements applicable to investment companies, and subject to the supervision 
of the Trust’s Board of Trustees. 
Risk 
Factors in Foreign Currency Transactions. The following is a summary of 
certain risks associated with foreign currency transactions: 
Imperfect Correlation. 
Foreign currency transactions present certain risks. In particular, the 
variable degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used 
in hedging strategies and price movements in a security being hedged creates the 
possibility that losses on the hedging transaction may be greater than gains in 
the value of a Fund’s securities. 
Liquidity. Hedging 
instruments may not be liquid in all circumstances. As a result, in volatile 
markets, the Funds may not be able to dispose of or offset a transaction without 
incurring losses. Although foreign currency transactions used for hedging 
purposes may reduce the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged 
security, at the same time the use of these instruments could tend to limit any 
potential gain which might result from an increase in the value of such 
security. 
Leverage and Volatility Risk. 
Derivative instruments, including foreign currency derivatives, may sometimes 
increase or leverage a Fund’s exposure to a particular market risk. Leverage 
enhances the price volatility of derivative instruments held by a Fund. 

Strategy Risk. Certain Funds 
may use foreign currency derivatives for hedging as well as non-hedging purposes including to gain or 
adjust exposure to currencies and securities markets or to increase income or 
gain to a Fund. There is no guarantee that these strategies will succeed and 
their use may subject a Fund to greater volatility and loss. Foreign currency 
transactions involve complex securities transactions that involve risks in 
addition to direct investments in securities including leverage risk and the 
risks associated with derivatives in general, currencies, and investments in 
foreign and emerging markets. 
Judgment of the Adviser. 
Successful use of foreign currency transactions by a Fund depends upon the 
ability of the applicable Adviser to predict correctly movements in the 
direction of interest and currency rates and other factors affecting markets for 
securities. If the expectations of the applicable Adviser are not met, a Fund 
would be in a worse position than if a foreign currency transaction had not been 
pursued. For example, if a Fund has hedged against the possibility of an 
increase in interest rates which would adversely affect the price of securities 
in its portfolio and the price of such securities increases instead, the Fund 
will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of its securities 
because it will have offsetting losses in its hedging positions. In addition, 
when utilizing instruments that require variation margin payments, if the Fund 
has insufficient cash to meet daily variation margin requirements, it may have 
to sell securities to meet such requirements. 
Other Risks. Such sales of 
securities may, but will not necessarily, be at increased prices which reflect 
the rising market. Thus, a Fund may have to sell securities at a time when it is 
disadvantageous to do so. 
It is impossible to forecast with 
precision the market value of portfolio securities at the expiration or maturity 
of a forward contract or futures contract. Accordingly, a Fund may have to 
purchase additional foreign currency on the spot market (and bear the expense of 
such purchase) if the market value of the security or securities being hedged is 
less than the amount of foreign currency a Fund is obligated to deliver and if a 
decision is made to sell the security or securities and make delivery of the 
foreign currency. Conversely, it may be necessary to sell on the spot market 
some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the portfolio security or 
securities if the market value of such security or securities exceeds the amount 
of foreign currency the Fund is obligated to deliver. 
Transaction and position hedging do 
not eliminate fluctuations in the underlying prices of the securities which a 
Fund owns or expects to purchase or sell. Rather, an Adviser may employ these 
techniques in an effort to maintain an investment portfolio that is relatively 
neutral to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to major 
foreign currencies and establish a rate of exchange which one can achieve at 
some future point in time. Additionally, although these techniques tend to 
minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged currency, 
they also tend to limit any potential gain which might result from the increase 
in the value of such currency. Moreover, it may not be possible for a Fund to 
hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the Fund is 
not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the anticipated 
devaluation level.

Insurance-Linked Securities 
The JPMorgan Strategic Income 
Opportunities Fund, JPMorgan Total Return Fund, JPMorgan Tax Aware Income 
Opportunities Fund and JPMorgan Multi-Manager Alternatives Fund may invest in 
debt instruments or equity securities structured as event-driven, event-linked 
or insurance-linked notes or catastrophe bonds (collectively, “catastrophe 
bonds”) and related instruments such as (re)insurance sidecars (collectively 
with catastrophe bonds “Insurance-Linked Securities”). These Insurance-Linked 
Securities are generally debt obligations or equity securities for which the 
return of principal and the payment of interest or dividends typically are 
contingent on the non-occurrence of a specific “trigger” event(s) that lead to 
economic and/or human loss, such as a hurricane of a specific category, 
earthquake of a particular magnitude, or other physical or weather-related 
phenomena. For some Insurance-Linked Securities, the magnitude of the effect of 
the trigger event on the security may be based on losses to a company or 
industry, modeled losses to a notional portfolio, industry indexes, readings of 
scientific instruments, or certain other parameters associated with a 
catastrophe rather than actual losses. If a trigger event, as defined within the 
terms of each Insurance-Linked Security, occurs, a Fund may lose a portion or 
all of its accrued interest, dividends and/or principal invested in such 
Insurance-Linked Security. In addition, if there is a dispute regarding a 
trigger event, there may be delays in the payment of principal, interest and 
dividends. A Fund is entitled to receive principal, interest and dividends 
payments so long as no trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude 
specified by the Insurance-Linked Security. 
Insurance-Linked Securities may be 
sponsored by government agencies, insurance companies or reinsurers and issued 
by special purpose corporations or other off-shore or on-shore entities (such 
special purpose entities are created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined 
objective, such as the issuance of a note in connection with a specific 
reinsurance transaction). Typically, Insurance-Linked Securities are issued by 
off-shore entities including entities in emerging markets and may be non-dollar 
denominated. As a result, the Funds will be subject to currency and foreign 
and emerging markets risk including the risks described in Foreign Investments. 
Often, catastrophe bonds provide for extensions of maturity that are mandatory, 
or optional at the discretion of the issuer or sponsor, in order to process and 
audit loss claims in those cases where a trigger event has, or possibly has, 
occurred. An extension of maturity may increase volatility. 
In addition to the specified trigger 
events, Insurance-Linked Securities also may expose a Fund to certain 
unanticipated risks including but not limited to issuer risk, credit risk, 
counterparty risk, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations, and 
adverse tax consequences. Additionally, Insurance-Linked Securities are subject 
to the risk that modeling used to calculate the probability of a trigger event 
may not be accurate and/or underestimate the likelihood of a trigger event. This 
may result in more frequent and greater than expected losses including loss of 
principal and/or interest with respect to catastrophic bonds and dividends with 
respect to (re)insurance sidecars. 
Insurance-Linked Securities are 
relatively new types of financial instruments. As such, there is no significant 
trading history of these securities, and there can be no assurance that markets 
for these instruments will be liquid at all times. Lack of a liquid market may 
impose the risk of higher transaction costs and the possibility that a Fund may 
be forced to liquidate positions when it would not be advantageous to do so. 
Insurance-Linked Securities are generally rated below investment grade or the 
unrated equivalent and have the same or similar risks as high yield debt 
securities (also known as junk bonds) including the risks described under High 
Yield/High Risk Securities/Junk Bonds and are subject to the risk that the Fund 
may lose some or all of its investment if the particular trigger identified 
under the Insurance-Linked Security occurs. 
Insurance-Linked Securities 
typically are restricted to qualified institutional buyers and, therefore, are 
not subject to registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) 
or any state securities commission generally are not listed on any national 
securities exchange. The amount of public information available with respect to 
Insurance-Linked Securities is generally less extensive than that which is 
available for exchange listed securities. There can be no assurance that future 
regulatory determinations will not adversely affect the overall market for 
Insurance-Linked Securities. 
Industry loss warranties are a type 
of Insurance-Linked Securities that are designed to protect insurers or 
reinsurers from severe losses due to significant catastrophic events. The buyer 
pays the seller a premium at the inception of the contract, and in return the 
buyer can make a claim if losses due to a certain class of catastrophic event 
(for example, Florida hurricanes), as estimated by a third-party, exceed an 
agreed trigger level. Industry loss warranties have standard terms and 
conditions and are collateralized. These contracts are evaluated using detailed 
underwriting information on the applicable exposures provided by the reinsurers 
or their intermediaries.

Inverse Floaters and Interest Rate Caps 
Inverse floaters are instruments 
whose interest rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on 
another security or the value of an index. The market value of an inverse 
floater will vary inversely with changes in market interest rates and will be 
more volatile in response to interest rate changes than that of a fixed rate 
obligation. Interest rate caps are financial instruments under which payments 
occur if an interest rate index exceeds a certain predetermined interest rate 
level, known as the cap rate, which is tied to a specific index. These financial 
products will be more volatile in price than securities which do not include 
such a structure. 
Investment Company Securities and Exchange-Traded Funds 

Investment Company Securities. A Fund may 
acquire the securities of other investment companies (“acquired funds”) to the 
extent permitted under the 1940 Act and consistent with its investment objective 
and strategies. As a shareholder of another investment company, a Fund would 
bear, along with other shareholders, its pro rata portion of the other 
investment company’s expenses, including advisory fees. These expenses would be 
in addition to the advisory and other expenses that a Fund bears directly in 
connection with its own operations. Except as described below, the 1940 Act 
currently requires that, as determined immediately after a purchase is made, 
(i) not more than 5% of the value of a fund’s total assets will be invested 
in the securities of any one investment company, (ii) not more than 10% of 
the value of its total assets will be invested in the aggregate in securities of 
investment companies as a group and (iii) not more than 3% of the 
outstanding voting stock of any one investment company will be owned by a fund. 

In addition, Section 17 of the 1940 
Act prohibits a Fund from investing in another J.P. Morgan Fund except as 
permitted by Section 12 of the 1940 Act, by rule, or by exemptive order. 

The limitations described above do 
not apply to investments in money market funds subject to certain conditions. 
All of the J.P. Morgan Funds may invest in affiliated and unaffiliated money 
market funds without limit under Rule 12d1-1 under the 1940 Act subject to the 
acquiring fund’s investment policies and restrictions and the conditions of the 
Rule. 
In addition, the 1940 Act’s limits 
and restrictions summarized above do not apply to J.P. Morgan Funds that invest 
in other J.P. Morgan Funds in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act, 
SEC rule, or an exemptive order issued by the SEC (each, a “Fund of Funds”; 
collectively, “Funds of Funds”). Such Funds of Funds include JPMorgan Investor 
Funds (the “Investor Funds”), the JPMorgan SmartRetirement Funds and the 
JPMorgan SmartRetirement Blend Funds (collectively, the “JPMorgan 
SmartRetirement Funds”), JPMorgan SmartAllocation Funds, JPMorgan Diversified 
Real Return Fund, JPMorgan Access Funds, JPMorgan Diversified Fund, and such 
other J.P. Morgan Funds that invest in other J.P. Morgan Funds in reliance on 
Section 12(d)(G) of the 1940 Act or the rules issued Section 12. 
Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act 
permits a fund to invest in acquired funds in the “same group of investment 
companies” (“affiliated funds”), government securities and short-term paper. In 
addition to the investments permitted by Section 12(d)(1)(G), Rule 12d1-2 
permits funds of funds to make investments in addition to affiliated funds under 
certain circumstances including: (1) unaffiliated investment companies (subject 
to certain limits), (2) other types of securities (such as stocks, bonds and 
other securities) not issued by an investment company that are consistent with 
the fund of fund’s investment policies and (3) affiliated and unaffiliated money 
market funds. In order to be an eligible investment under Section 12(d)(1)(G), 
an affiliated fund must have a policy prohibiting it from investing in other 
funds under Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the 1940 Act. 
In addition to investments permitted 
by Section 12(d)(1)(G) and Rule 12d1-2, the J.P. Morgan Funds may invest in 
derivatives pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC. Under the 
exemptive order, the Funds of Funds are permitted to invest in financial 
instruments that may not be considered “securities” for purposes of Rule 12d-1 
subject to certain conditions, including a finding of the Board of Trustees that 
the advisory fees charged by the Adviser to the Funds of Funds are for services 
that are in addition to, and not duplicative of, the advisory services provided 
to an underlying fund. 
Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”). ETFs are pooled 
investment vehicles whose ownership interests are purchased and sold on a 
securities exchange. ETFs may be structured investment companies, depositary 
receipts or other pooled investment vehicles. As shareholders of an ETF, the 
Funds will bear their pro rata portion of any fees and expenses of the ETFs. 
Although shares of ETFs are traded on an exchange, shares of certain ETFs may 
not be redeemable by the ETF. In addition, ETFs may trade at a price below their 
net asset value (also known as a discount). 
 
Part II - 19 


Certain Funds may use ETFs to gain 
exposure to various asset classes and markets or types of strategies and 
investments By way of example, ETFs may be structured as broad based ETFs that 
invest in a broad group of stocks from different industries and market sectors; 
select sector; or market ETFs that invest in debt securities from a select 
sector of the economy, a single industry or related industries; or ETFs that 
invest in foreign and emerging markets securities. Other types of ETFs continue 
to be developed and the Fund may invest in them to the extent consistent with 
such Funds’ investment objectives, policies and restrictions. The ETFs in which 
the Funds invest are subject to the risks applicable to the types of securities 
and investments used by the ETFs (e.g., debt securities are subject to risks 
like credit and interest rate risks; emerging markets securities are subject 
risks like currency risks and foreign and emerging markets risk; derivatives are 
subject to leverage and counterparty risk). 
ETFs may be actively managed or 
index-based. Actively managed ETFs are subject to management risk and may not 
achieve their objective if the ETF’s manager’s expectations regarding particular 
securities or markets are not met. Generally, an index based ETF’s objective is 
to track the performance of a specified index. Index based ETFs may invest in a 
securities portfolio that includes substantially all of the securities in 
substantially the same amount as the securities included in the designated index 
or a representative sample. Because passively managed ETFs are designed to track 
an index, securities may be purchased, retained and sold at times when an 
actively managed ETF would not do so. As a result, shareholders of a Fund that 
invest in such an ETF can expect greater risk of loss (and a correspondingly 
greater prospect of gain) from changes in the value of securities that are 
heavily weighted in the index than would be the case if ETF were not fully 
invested in such securities. This risk is increased if a few component 
securities represent a highly concentrated weighting in the designated index. 

Unless permitted by the 1940 Act or 
an order or rule issued by the SEC (see “Investment Company Securities” above 
for more information), the Fund’s investments in unaffiliated ETFs that are 
structured as investment companies as defined in the 1940 Act are subject to 
certain percentage limitations of the 1940 Act regarding investments in other 
investment companies. As a general matter, these percentage limitations 
currently require a Fund to limit its investments in any one issue of ETFs to 5% 
of the Fund’s total assets and 3% of the outstanding voting securities of the 
ETF issue. Moreover, a Fund’s investments in all ETFs may not currently exceed 
10% of the Fund’s total assets under the 1940 Act, when aggregated with all 
other investments in investment companies. ETFs that are not structured as 
investment companies as defined in the 1940 Act are not subject to these 
percentage limitations. 
SEC exemptive orders granted to 
various ETFs and their investment advisers permit the Funds to invest beyond the 
1940 Act limits, subject to certain terms and conditions, including a finding of 
the Board of Trustees that the advisory fees charged by the Adviser to the Fund 
are for services that are in addition to, and not duplicative of, the advisory 
services provided to those ETFs. 
Loans 

Some of the Funds may invest in 
fixed and floating rate loans (“Loans”). Loans may include senior floating rate 
loans (“Senior Loans”) and secured and unsecured loans, second lien or more 
junior loans (“Junior Loans”) and bridge loans or bridge facilities (“Bridge 
Loans”). Loans are typically arranged through private negotiations between 
borrowers in the U.S. or in foreign or emerging markets which may be corporate 
issuers or issuers of sovereign debt obligations (“Obligors”) and one or more 
financial institutions and other lenders (“Lenders”). Generally, the Funds 
invest in Loans by purchasing assignments of all or a portion of Loans 
(“Assignments”) or Loan participations (“Participations”) from third parties. 

A Fund has direct rights against the 
Obligor on the Loan when it purchases an Assignment. Because Assignments are 
arranged through private negotiations between potential assignees and potential 
assignors, however, the rights and obligations acquired by a Fund as the 
purchaser of an Assignment may differ from, and be more limited than, those held 
by the assigning Lender. With respect to Participations, typically, a Fund will 
have a contractual relationship only with the Lender and not with the Obligor. 
The agreement governing Participations may limit the rights of a Fund to vote on 
certain changes which may be made to the Loan agreement, such as waiving a 
breach of a covenant. However, the holder of a Participation will generally have 
the right to vote on certain fundamental issues such as changes in principal 
amount, payment dates and interest rate. Participations may entail certain risks 
relating to the creditworthiness of the parties from which the participations 
are obtained. 
A Loan is typically originated, 
negotiated and structured by a U.S. or foreign commercial bank, insurance 
company, finance company or other financial institution (the “Agent”) for a 
group of Loan investors. The Agent typically administers and enforces the Loan 
on behalf of the other Loan investors in the syndicate. The Agent’s duties may 
include responsibility for the collection of principal and interest payments 
from the Obligor and the 
 
Part II - 20 


apportionment of these payments to 
the credit of all Loan investors. The Agent is also typically responsible for 
monitoring compliance with the covenants contained in the Loan agreement based 
upon reports prepared by the Obligor. In addition, an institution, typically but 
not always the Agent, holds any collateral on behalf of the Loan investors. In 
the event of a default by the Obligor, it is possible, though unlikely, that the 
Fund could receive a portion of the borrower’s collateral. If the Fund receives 
collateral other than cash, any proceeds received from liquidation of such 
collateral will be available for investment as part of the Fund’s portfolio. 

In the process of buying, selling 
and holding Loans, a Fund may receive and/or pay certain fees. These fees are in 
addition to interest payments received and may include facility fees, commitment 
fees, commissions and prepayment penalty fees. When a Fund buys or sells a Loan 
it may pay a fee. In certain circumstances, a Fund may receive a prepayment 
penalty fee upon prepayment of a Loan. 
Additional Information concerning 
Senior Loans. Senior Loans typically hold the most senior position in the 
capital structure of the Obligor, are typically secured with specific collateral 
and have a claim on the assets and/or stock of the Obligor that is senior to 
that held by subordinated debtholders and shareholders of the Obligor. 
Collateral for Senior Loans may include (i) working capital assets, such as 
accounts receivable and inventory; (ii) tangible fixed assets, such as real 
property, buildings and equipment; (iii) intangible assets, such as 
trademarks and patent rights; and/or (iv) security interests in shares of 
stock of subsidiaries or affiliates. 
Additional Information concerning 
Junior Loans. Junior Loans include secured and unsecured loans including 
subordinated loans, second lien and more junior loans, and bridge loans. Second 
lien and more junior loans (“Junior Lien Loans”) are generally second or further 
in line in terms of repayment priority. In addition, Junior Lien Loans may have 
a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or other more senior liens 
or may be secured by a separate set of assets. Junior Loans generally give 
investors priority over general unsecured creditors in the event of an asset 
sale. 
Additional Information concerning 
Bridge Loans. Bridge Loans are short-term loan arrangements (e.g., 12 to 18 
months) typically made by an Obligor in anticipation of intermediate-term or 
long-term permanent financing. Most Bridge Loans are structured as floating-rate 
debt with step-up provisions under 
which the interest rate on the Bridge Loan rises the longer the Loan remains 
outstanding. In addition, Bridge Loans commonly contain a conversion feature 
that allows the Bridge Loan investor to convert its Loan interest to senior 
exchange notes if the Loan has not been prepaid in full on or prior to its 
maturity date. Bridge Loans typically are structured as Senior Loans but may be 
structured as Junior Loans. 
Additional Information concerning 
Unfunded Commitments. Unfunded commitments are contractual obligations 
pursuant to which the Fund agrees to invest in a Loan at a future date. 
Typically, the Fund receives a commitment fee for entering into the Unfunded 
Commitment. 
Additional Information concerning 
Synthetic Letters of Credit. Loans include synthetic letters of credit. In a 
synthetic letter of credit transaction, the Lender typically creates a special 
purpose entity or a credit-linked deposit account for the purpose of funding a 
letter of credit to the borrower. When a Fund invests in a synthetic letter of 
credit, the Fund is typically paid a rate based on the Lender’s borrowing costs 
and the terms of the synthetic letter of credit. Synthetic letters of credit are 
typically structured as Assignments with the Fund acquiring direct rights 
against the Obligor. 
Additional Information concerning 
Loan Originations. In addition to investing in loan assignments and 
participations, the Strategic Income Opportunities Fund may originate Loans in 
which the Fund would lend money directly to a borrower by investing in limited 
liability companies or corporations that make loans directly to 
borrowers. The terms of the Loans are negotiated with borrowers in private 
transactions. Such Loans would be collateralized, typically with tangible 
fixed assets such as real property or interests in real property. Such Loans may 
also include mezzanine loans. Unlike Loans secured by a mortgage on real 
property, mezzanine loans are collateralized by an equity interest in a special 
purpose vehicle that owns the real property. 
Limitations on Investments in 
Loan Assignments and Participations. If a government entity is a borrower on 
a Loan, the Fund will consider the government to be the issuer of an Assignment 
or Participation for purposes of a Fund’s fundamental investment policy that it 
will not invest 25% or more of its total assets in securities of issuers 
conducting their principal business activities in the same industry (i.e., 
foreign government). 
Limited Federal Securities Law 
Protections. Certain Loans may not be considered securities under the 
federal securities laws. In such circumstances, fewer legal protections may be 
available with respect to a Fund’s investment in those Loans. In particular, if 
a Loan is not considered a security under the federal securities laws, certain 
legal protections normally available to investors under the federal securities 
laws, such as those against fraud and misrepresentation, may not be available. 

 
Part II - 21 


Risk Factors of Loans. Loans 
are subject to the risks associated with debt obligations in general including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. When a Loan is acquired from a 
Lender, the risk includes the credit risk associated with the Obligor of the 
underlying Loan. The Fund may incur additional credit risk when the Fund 
acquires a participation in a Loan from another lender because the Fund must 
assume the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the other lender from which the 
Loan was acquired. To the extent that Loans involve Obligors in foreign or 
emerging markets, such Loans are subject to the risks associated with foreign 
investments or investments in emerging markets in general. The following 
outlines some of the additional risks associated with Loans. 
High Yield Securities Risk. 
The Loans that a Fund invests in may not be rated by an NRSRO, will not be 
registered with the SEC or any state securities commission and will not be 
listed on any national securities exchange. To the extent that such high yield 
Loans are rated, they typically will be rated below investment grade and are 
subject to an increased risk of default in the payment of principal and interest 
as well as the other risks described under “High Yield/High Risk 
Securities/Junk Bonds.” Loans are vulnerable to market sentiment such that 
economic conditions or other events may reduce the demand for Loans and cause 
their value to decline rapidly and unpredictably. 
Liquidity Risk. Although the 
Funds limit their investments in illiquid securities to no more than 15% of a 
Fund’s net assets (5% of the total assets for the Money Market Funds) at the 
time of purchase, Loans that are deemed to be liquid at the time of purchase may 
become illiquid or less liquid. No active trading market may exist for certain 
Loans and certain Loans may be subject to restrictions on resale or have a 
limited secondary market. Certain Loans may be subject to irregular trading 
activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods. The 
inability to dispose of certain Loans in a timely fashion or at a favorable 
price could result in losses to a Fund. Also, to the extent that a Fund needs to 
satisfy redemption requests or cover unanticipated cash shortfalls, the Fund may 
seek to engage in borrowing under a credit facility or enter into lending 
agreements under which the Fund would borrow money for temporary purposes 
directly from another J.P. Morgan Fund (please see “Interfund Lending”). Certain 
Money Market Funds also use an interest bearing deposit facility to set aside 
cash at a level estimated to meet the Money Market Fund’s next business day’s 
intraday redemption orders. See “Interest Bearing Deposit Facility” for more 
information. 
Collateral and Subordination 
Risk. With respect to Loans that are secured, a Fund is subject to the risk 
that collateral securing the Loan will decline in value or have no value or that 
the Fund’s lien is or will become junior in payment to other liens. A decline in 
value of the collateral, whether as a result of market value declines, 
bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise, could cause the Loan to be under 
collateralized or unsecured. In such event, the Fund may have the ability to 
require that the Obligor pledge additional collateral. The Fund, however, is 
subject to the risk that the Obligor may not pledge such additional collateral 
or a sufficient amount of collateral. In some cases, there may be no formal 
requirement for the Obligor to pledge additional collateral. In addition, 
collateral may consist of assets that may not be readily liquidated, and there 
is no assurance that the liquidation of such assets would satisfy an Obligor’s 
obligation on a Loan. If the Fund were unable to obtain sufficient proceeds upon 
a liquidation of such assets, this could negatively affect Fund performance. 

If an Obligor becomes involved in 
bankruptcy proceedings, a court may restrict the ability of the Fund to demand 
immediate repayment of the Loan by Obligor or otherwise liquidate the 
collateral. A court may also invalidate the Loan or the Fund’s security interest 
in collateral or subordinate the Fund’s rights under a Senior Loan or Junior 
Loan to the interest of the Obligor’s other creditors, including unsecured 
creditors, or cause interest or principal previously paid to be refunded to the 
Obligor. If a court required interest or principal to be refunded, it could 
negatively affect Fund performance. Such action by a court could be based, for 
example, on a “fraudulent conveyance” claim to the effect that the Obligor did 
not receive fair consideration for granting the security interest in the Loan 
collateral to a Fund. For Senior Loans made in connection with a highly 
leveraged transaction, consideration for granting a security interest may be 
deemed inadequate if the proceeds of the Loan were not received or retained by 
the Obligor, but were instead paid to other persons (such as shareholders of the 
Obligor) in an amount which left the Obligor insolvent or without sufficient 
working capital. There are also other events, such as the failure to perfect a 
security interest due to faulty documentation or faulty official filings, which 
could lead to the invalidation of a Fund’s security interest in Loan collateral. 
If the Fund’s security interest in Loan collateral is invalidated or a Senior 
Loan were subordinated to other debt of an Obligor in bankruptcy or other 
proceedings, the Fund would have substantially lower recovery, and perhaps no 
recovery on the full amount of the principal and interest due on the Loan, or 
the Fund could have to refund interest. Lenders and investors in Loans can be 
sued by other creditors and shareholders of the Obligors. Losses can be greater 
than the original Loan amount and occur years after the principal and interest 
on the Loan have been repaid. 
 
Part II - 22 


Agent Risk. Selling Lenders, 
Agents and other entities who may be positioned between a Fund and the Obligor 
will likely conduct their principal business activities in the banking, finance 
and financial services industries. Investments in Loans may be more impacted by 
a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting such industries 
than other types of investments. Entities engaged in such industries may be more 
susceptible to, among other things, fluctuations in interest rates, changes in 
the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy, government regulations 
concerning such industries and concerning capital raising activities generally 
and fluctuations in the financial markets generally. An Agent, Lender or other 
entity positioned between a Fund and the Obligor may become insolvent or enter 
FDIC receivership or bankruptcy. The Fund might incur certain costs and delays 
in realizing payment on a Loan or suffer a loss of principal and/or interest if 
assets or interests held by the Agent, Lender or other party positioned between 
the Fund and the Obligor are determined to be subject to the claims of the 
Agent’s, Lender’s or such other party’s creditors. 
Regulatory Changes. To the 
extent that legislation or state or federal regulators that regulate certain 
financial institutions impose additional requirements or restrictions with 
respect to the ability of such institutions to make Loans, particularly in 
connection with highly leveraged transactions, the availability of Loans for 
investment may be adversely affected. Furthermore, such legislation or 
regulation could depress the market value of Loans held by the Fund. 
Inventory Risk. Affiliates of 
the Adviser may participate in the primary and secondary market for Loans. 
Because of limitations imposed by applicable law, the presence of the Adviser’s 
affiliates in the Loan market may restrict a Fund’s ability to acquire some 
Loans, affect the timing of such acquisition or affect the price at which the 
Loan is acquired. 
Information Risk. There is 
typically less publicly available information concerning Loans than other types 
of fixed income investments. As a result, a Fund generally will be dependent on 
reports and other information provided by the Obligor, either directly or 
through an Agent, to evaluate the Obligor’s creditworthiness or to determine the 
Obligor’s compliance with the covenants and other terms of the Loan Agreement. 
Such reliance may make investments in Loans more susceptible to fraud than other 
types of investments. In addition, because the Adviser may wish to invest in the 
publicly traded securities of an Obligor, it may not have access to material 
non-public information regarding the 
Obligor to which other Loan investors have access. 
Junior Loan Risk. Junior 
Loans are subject to the same general risks inherent to any Loan investment. Due 
to their lower place in the Obligor’s capital structure and possible unsecured 
status, Junior Loans involve a higher degree of overall risk than Senior Loans 
of the same Obligor. Junior Loans that are Bridge Loans generally carry the 
expectation that the Obligor will be able to obtain permanent financing in the 
near future. Any delay in obtaining permanent financing subjects the Bridge Loan 
investor to increased risk. An Obligor’s use of Bridge Loans also involves the 
risk that the Obligor may be unable to locate permanent financing to replace the 
Bridge Loan, which may impair the Obligor’s perceived creditworthiness. 

Mezzanine Loan Risk. In 
addition to the risk factors described above, mezzanine loans are subject to 
additional risks. Unlike conventional mortgage loans, mezzanine loans are not 
secured by a mortgage on the underlying real property but rather by a pledge of 
equity interests (such as a partnership or limited liability company membership) 
in the property owner or another company in the ownership structures that has 
control over the property. Such companies are typically structured as special 
purpose entities. Generally, mezzanine loans may be more highly leveraged than 
other types of Loans and subordinate in the capital structure of the Obligor. 
While foreclosure of a mezzanine loan generally takes substantially less time 
than foreclosure of a traditional mortgage, the holders of a mezzanine loan have 
different remedies available versus the holder of a first lien mortgage loan. In 
addition, a sale of the underlying real property would not be unencumbered, and 
thus would be subject to encumbrances by more senior mortgages and liens of 
other creditors. Upon foreclosure of a mezzanine loan, the holder of the 
mezzanine loan acquires an equity interest in the Obligor. However, because of 
the subordinate nature of a mezzanine loan, the real property continues to be 
subject to the lien of the mortgage and other liens encumbering the real estate. 
In the event the holder of a mezzanine loan forecloses on its equity collateral, 
the holder may need to cure the Obligor’s existing mortgage defaults or, to the 
extent permissible under the governing agreements, sell the property to pay off 
other creditors. To the extent that the amount of mortgages and senior 
indebtedness and liens exceed the value of the real estate, the collateral 
underlying the mezzanine loan may have little or no value. 
Foreclosure Risk. There may 
be additional costs associated with enforcing a Fund’s remedies under a Loan 
including additional legal costs and payment of real property transfer taxes 
upon foreclosure in certain jurisdictions. As a result of these additional 
costs, the Fund may determine that pursuing foreclosure on the 
 
Part II - 23 


Loan collateral is not worth the 
associated costs. In addition, if the Fund incurs costs and the collateral loses 
value or is not recovered by the Fund in foreclosure, the Fund could lose more 
than its original investment in the Loan. Foreclosure risk is heightened for 
Junior Loans, including certain mezzanine loans. 
Miscellaneous Investment Strategies and Risks 

Borrowings. A Fund may borrow for 
temporary purposes and/or for investment purposes. Such a practice will result 
in leveraging of a Fund’s assets and may cause a Fund to liquidate portfolio 
positions when it would not be advantageous to do so. This borrowing may be 
secured or unsecured. If a Fund utilizes borrowings, for investment purposes or 
otherwise, it may pledge up to 33 1/3% of its total assets to secure such 
borrowings. Provisions of the 1940 Act require a Fund to maintain continuous 
asset coverage (that is, total assets including borrowings, less liabilities 
exclusive of borrowings) of 300% of the amount borrowed, with an exception for 
borrowings not in excess of 5% of the Fund’s total assets made for temporary 
administrative or emergency purposes. Any borrowings for temporary 
administrative purposes in excess of 5% of the Fund’s total assets must maintain 
continuous asset coverage. If the 300% asset coverage should decline as a result 
of market fluctuations or other reasons, a Fund may be required to sell some of 
its portfolio holdings within three days to reduce the debt and restore the 300% 
asset coverage, even though it may be disadvantageous from an investment 
standpoint to sell securities at that time. Borrowing will tend to exaggerate 
the effect on net asset value of any increase or decrease in the market value of 
a Fund’s portfolio. Money borrowed will be subject to interest costs which may 
or may not be recovered by appreciation of the securities purchased. A Fund also 
may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with such 
borrowing or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit; 
either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the 
stated interest rate. 
Certain types of investments are 
considered to be borrowings under precedents issued by the SEC. Such investments 
are subject to the limitations as well as asset segregation requirements. In 
addition, each Fund may enter into Interfund Lending Arrangements. Please see 
“Interfund Lending”. 
Commodity-Linked Derivatives. 
Commodity-linked derivatives are derivative instruments the value of which is 
linked to the value of a commodity, commodity index or commodity futures 
contract. A Fund’s investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments may 
subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional 
securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of 
commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall 
market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or 
factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, 
weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, 
political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked 
derivatives creates the possibility for greater loss (including the likelihood 
of greater volatility of the Fund’s net asset value), and there can be no 
assurance that a Fund’s use of leverage will be successful. Tax considerations 
may limit a Fund’s ability to pursue investments in commodity-linked 
derivatives. 
Commodity-Related Pooled Investment Vehicles. 
Commodity-related pooled investment vehicles include ownership interests in 
grantor trusts and other pooled investment vehicles that hold tangible assets 
such as gold, silver or other commodities or invest in commodity futures. 
Grantor trusts are typically traded on an exchange. 
Investors do not have the rights 
normally associated with ownership of other types of shares when they invest in 
pooled investment vehicles holding commodities or commodity futures, including 
those structured as limited partnerships or grantor trusts holding commodities. 
For example, the owners of these commodity-related grantor trusts or limited 
partnerships do not have the right to elect directors, receive dividends or take 
other actions normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation. 
Holders of a certain percentage of shares in a grantor trust may have the right 
to terminate the trust or exercise other rights which would not be available to 
small investors. If investors other than a Fund exercise their right to 
terminate, a Fund that wishes to invest in the underlying commodity through the 
pooled investment vehicle will have to find another investment and may not be 
able to find another vehicle that offers the same investment features. In the 
event that one or more participants holding a substantial interest in these 
pooled investment vehicles withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the 
pooled investment vehicle will likely decrease which could adversely affect the 
market price of the pooled investment vehicle and result in a Fund incurring a 
loss on its investments. 
These pooled investment vehicles are 
not registered investment companies, and many are not commodity pools, and 
therefore, do not have the protections available to those types of investments 
under federal securities or commodities laws. For example, unlike registered 
investment companies, these vehicles are not subject to federal securities laws 
that limit transactions with affiliates, require redemption of shares, or limit 
sales load. Although 
 
Part II - 24 


shares of these vehicles may be 
traded on an exchange, there may be no active market for such shares and such 
shares may be highly illiquid. 
These vehicles are subject to the 
risks associated with direct investments in commodities. The market price of 
shares of these vehicles will be as unpredictable as the price of the underlying 
commodity. Many factors can cause a decline in the prices of commodities 
including a change in economic conditions, such as a recession. This risk is 
magnified when the commodity is used in manufacturing. In addition, the prices 
of commodities may be adversely impacted by a change in the attitude of 
speculators and investors toward the applicable commodity, or a significant 
increase in commodity price hedging activity. In addition, the value of the 
shares will be adversely affected if the assets owned by the trust are lost, 
damaged or of inferior quality. 
The commodities represented by 
shares of a grantor trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales 
of the underlying commodities necessary to pay trust fees and expenses, 
including expenses associated with indemnification of certain service providers 
to the pooled investment vehicle. Without increases in the price of the 
underlying commodity sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of 
the investment will decline and a Fund will incur a loss on its investment. 

Commodity-related grantor trusts are 
passive investment vehicles. This means that the value of the investment in a 
grantor trust may be adversely affected by trust losses that, if the trust had 
been actively managed, it might have been possible to avoid. A Fund’s intention 
to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code may 
limit its ability to make investments in grantor trusts or limited partnerships 
that invest in commodities or commodity futures. 
Cyber Security Risk. As the use of 
technology has become more prevalent in the course of business, the Funds have 
become more susceptible to operational and financial risks associated with cyber 
security, including: theft, loss, misuse, improper release, corruption and 
destruction of, or unauthorized access to, confidential or highly restricted 
data relating to a Fund and its shareholders; and compromises or failures to 
systems, networks, devices and applications relating to the operations of a Fund 
and its service providers. Cyber security risks may result in financial losses 
to a Fund and its shareholders; the inability of a Fund to transact business 
with its shareholders; delays or mistakes in the calculation of a Fund’s NAV or 
other materials provided to shareholders; the inability to process transactions 
with shareholders or other parties; violations of privacy and other laws; 
regulatory fines, penalties and reputational damage; and compliance and 
remediation costs, legal fees and other expenses. A Fund’s service 
providers (including, but not limited to, its investment adviser, any 
sub-advisers, administrator, transfer agent, and custodian or their agents), 
financial intermediaries, companies in which a Fund invests and parties with 
which a Fund engages in portfolio or other transactions also may be adversely 
impacted by cyber security risks in their own businesses, which could result in 
losses to a Fund or its shareholders. While measures have been developed 
which are designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber security, there is 
no guarantee that those measures will be effective, particularly since the Funds 
do not directly control the cyber security defenses or plans of their service 
providers, financial intermediaries and companies in which they invest or with 
which they do business. 
Volcker Rule Risk. Section 619 of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and certain rules 
promulgated thereunder (known as the Volcker Rule) places restrictions on the 
activities of banking entities, including the adviser and its affiliates, and 
may impact the long-term viability of a Fund. Under the Volcker Rule, if the 
adviser or its affiliates own 25% or more of the ownership interests of a Fund 
outside of the permitted seeding time period, a Fund could be subject to 
restrictions on trading that would adversely impact a Fund’s ability to execute 
its investment strategy. As a result, the adviser and/or its affiliates may be 
required to reduce their ownership interests in a Fund at a time that is sooner 
than would otherwise be desirable. This may require the sale of Fund securities, 
which may result in losses, increased transaction costs and adverse tax 
consequences. In addition, the ongoing viability of a Fund may be adversely 
impacted by the anticipated or actual redemption of Fund shares owned by the 
adviser and its affiliates and could result in a Fund’s liquidation. 
Exchange-Traded Notes (“ETNs”) are senior, 
unsecured notes linked to an index. Like ETFs, they may be bought and sold like 
shares of stock on an exchange. However, ETNs have a different underlying 
structure. While ETF shares represent an interest in a portfolio of securities, 
ETNs are structured products that are an obligation of the issuing bank, whereby 
the bank agrees to pay a return based on the target index less any fees. 
Essentially, these notes allow individual investors to have access to 
derivatives linked to commodities and assets such as oil, currencies and foreign 
stock indexes. ETNs combine certain aspects of bonds and ETFs. Similar to ETFs, 
ETNs are traded on a major exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) during 
normal trading hours. However, investors can also hold the ETN until maturity. 
At maturity, the issuer pays to the investor a cash amount equal to principal 

 
Part II - 25 


amount, subject to the day’s index 
factor. ETN returns are based upon the performance of a market index minus 
applicable fees. ETNs do not make periodic coupon payments and provide no 
principal protection. The value of an ETN may be influenced by time to maturity, 
level of supply and demand for the ETN, volatility and lack of liquidity in 
underlying commodities markets, changes in the applicable interest rates, 
changes in the issuer’s credit rating and economic, legal, political or 
geographic events that affect the referenced commodity. The value of the ETN may 
drop due to a downgrade in the issuer’s credit rating, despite the underlying 
index remaining unchanged. The timing and character of income and gains derived 
from ETNs is under consideration by the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue 
Service and may also be affected by future legislation. 
Impact of Large Redemptions and Purchases of Fund 
Shares. Under applicable regulations, the Adviser or an affiliate of the 
Adviser may be required to reduce its seed investment or other ownership 
interest in a Fund at a time that is sooner than the Adviser or its affiliate 
otherwise would. In addition to such redemptions of seed investment, from time 
to time, shareholders of a Fund (which may include the Adviser or affiliates of 
the Adviser or accounts for which the Adviser or its affiliates serve as 
investment adviser or trustee or, for certain Funds, affiliated and/or non-affiliated registered investment 
companies that invest in a Fund) may make relatively large redemptions or 
purchases of Fund shares. These transactions may cause a Fund to have to sell 
securities, or invest additional cash, as the case may be. While it is 
impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time, there 
could be adverse effects on a Fund’s performance to the extent that the Fund is 
required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise 
do so, which may result in a loss to the Fund. These transactions may result in 
higher portfolio turnover, accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales 
of securities resulted in capital gains or other income and increase transaction 
costs, which may impact the Fund’s expense ratio. Additionally, a significant 
reduction in Fund assets would result in Fund expenses being spread over a small 
asset base, potentially causing an increase in the Fund’s expense ratio. To the 
extent that such transactions result in short-term capital gains, such gains 
will generally be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. In addition to the 
above information, the Funds’ SAIs include disclosure of accounts holding more 
than 5% of a Fund’s voting securities. 
Government Intervention in Financial Markets. 
Events in the financial sector over the past several years have resulted in 
reduced liquidity in credit and fixed income markets and in an unusually high 
degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestically and 
internationally. While entire markets have been impacted, issuers that have 
exposure to the real estate, mortgage and credit markets have been particularly 
affected. These events and the potential for continuing market turbulence may 
have an adverse effect on the Funds’ investments. It is uncertain how long these 
conditions will continue. 
Recent instability in the financial 
markets has led governments and regulators around the world to take a number of 
unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and 
segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility, and 
in some cases a lack of liquidity. Governments, their regulatory agencies, or 
self regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the 
instruments in which the Funds invest, or the issuers of such instruments, in 
ways that are unforeseeable. Legislation or regulation may also change the way 
in which the Funds themselves are regulated. Such legislation or regulation 
could limit or preclude a Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 

Governments or their agencies may 
also acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership 
interests in those institutions. The implications of government ownership and 
disposition of these assets are unclear, and such a program may have positive or 
negative effects on the liquidity, valuation and performance of a Fund’s 
portfolio holdings. Furthermore, volatile financial markets can expose the Funds 
to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing 
portfolio instruments held by the Funds. 
Interest Bearing Deposit Facility. As part 
of seeking to provide intraday liquidity, certain Money Market Funds generally 
set aside cash in an interest bearing deposit facility (“IBDF”) at a level 
estimated to meet the Money Market Fund’s next business day’s intraday 
redemption orders. Under the IBDF, each Money Market Fund expects to retain a 
balance (“designated balance”) overnight in its custodial cash deposit account 
with JPMorgan Chase Bank at a level estimated to meet its next business day’s 
intraday redemption orders. As redemption payments are processed for the 
Money Market Fund on the next business day, outgoing wires are debited from its 
account. At the end of that day, the Money Market Fund seeks to allocate 
cash to the account to restore the designated balance. A Money Market Fund 
receives interest overnight on the designated balance. 
Interfund Lending. To satisfy redemption 
requests or to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls, a Fund may enter into 
lending agreements (“Interfund Lending Agreements”) under which the Fund would 
lend money and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from another 
J.P. Morgan Fund through a credit facility (“Interfund Loan”), subject to 
meeting the conditions of an SEC exemptive order granted to the Funds permitting 
such interfund 
 
Part II - 26 


lending. No Fund may borrow more 
than the lesser of the amount permitted by Section 18 of the 1940 Act or 
the amount permitted by its investment limitations. All Interfund Loans will 
consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the Fund otherwise would invest in 
short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments. 
If a Fund has outstanding 
borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund (a) will be at an interest rate 
equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (b) will be secured at 
least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of 
collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, 
(c) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in 
any event not over seven days) and (d) will provide that, if an event of 
default occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the 
Fund, the event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice 
by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the 
Interfund Lending Agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the Interfund 
Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call 
will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its 
agreement with the borrowing Fund. 
A Fund may make an unsecured 
borrowing through the credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all 
sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total 
assets; provided, that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other 
lender, including but not limited to another J.P. Morgan Fund, the Fund’s 
interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at 
least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding 
loan that requires collateral. If a Fund’s total outstanding borrowings 
immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total 
assets, the Fund may borrow through the credit facility on a secured basis only. 
A Fund may not borrow through the credit facility nor from any other source if 
its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would 
exceed the limits imposed by Section 18 of the 1940 Act. 
No Fund may lend to another Fund 
through the interfund lending credit facility if the loan would cause its 
aggregate outstanding loans through the credit facility to exceed 15% of the 
lending Fund’s net assets at the time of the loan. A Fund’s Interfund Loans to 
any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund’s net assets. The duration 
of Interfund Loans is limited to the time required to receive payment for 
securities sold, but in no event may the duration exceed seven days. Loans 
effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan 
transactions for purposes of this condition. Each Interfund Loan may be called 
on one business day’s notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a 
borrowing Fund. 
The limitations detailed above and 
the other conditions of the SEC exemptive order permitting interfund lending are 
designed to minimize the risks associated with interfund lending for both the 
lending fund and the borrowing fund. However, no borrowing or lending activity 
is without risk. When a Fund borrows money from another Fund, there is a risk 
that the loan could be called on one day’s notice or not renewed, in which case 
the Fund may have to borrow from a bank at higher rates if an Interfund Loan 
were not available from another Fund. A delay in repayment to a lending Fund 
could result in a lost opportunity or additional lending costs. 
Master Limited Partnerships. Certain 
companies are organized as master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) in which 
ownership interests are publicly traded. MLPs often own several properties or 
businesses (or directly own interests) that are related to real estate 
development and oil and gas industries, but they also may finance motion 
pictures, research and development and other projects or provide financial 
services. Generally, an MLP is operated under the supervision of one or more 
managing general partners. Limited partners (like a Fund that invests in an MLP) 
are not involved in the day-to-day management of the 
partnership. They are allocated income and capital gains associated with the 
partnership project in accordance with the terms established in the partnership 
agreement. 
The risks of investing in an MLP are 
generally those inherent in investing in a partnership as opposed to a 
corporation. For example, state law governing partnerships is often less 
restrictive than state law governing corporations. Accordingly, there may be 
fewer protections afforded investors in an MLP than investors in a corporation. 
Additional risks involved with investing in an MLP are risks associated with the 
specific industry or industries in which the partnership invests, such as the 
risks of investing in real estate, or oil and gas industries. 
New 
Financial Products. New options and futures contracts and other 
financial products, and various combinations thereof, including over-the-counter products, continue to 
be developed. These various products may be used to adjust the risk and return 
characteristics of certain Funds’ investments. These various products may 
increase or decrease exposure to security prices, interest rates, commodity 
prices, or other factors that affect security values, regardless of the issuer’s 
credit risk. If market conditions do not perform as expected, the performance of 
a Fund would be less favorable than it would have been if these products were 
not used. In addition, losses may occur if counterparties involved in 
transactions do not perform as promised. These products may expose the Fund to 
potentially greater return as well as potentially greater risk of loss than more 
traditional fixed income investments. 
 
Part II - 27 


Private Placements, Restricted Securities and Other 
Unregistered Securities. Subject to its policy limitation, a Fund may 
acquire investments that are illiquid or have limited liquidity, such as 
commercial obligations issued in reliance on the so-called “private placement” exemption from 
registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, 
as amended (the “1933 Act”), and cannot be offered for public sale in the U.S. 
without first being registered under the 1933 Act. An illiquid investment is any 
investment that cannot be disposed of within seven days in the normal course of 
business at approximately the amount at which it is valued by a Fund. The price 
a Fund pays for illiquid securities or receives upon resale may be lower than 
the price paid or received for similar securities with a more liquid market. 
Accordingly the valuation of these securities will reflect any limitations on 
their liquidity. 
A Fund is subject to a risk that 
should the Fund decide to sell illiquid securities when a ready buyer is not 
available at a price the Fund deems representative of their value, the value of 
the Fund’s net assets could be adversely affected. Where an illiquid security 
must be registered under the 1933 Act before it may be sold, a Fund may be 
obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses, and a considerable 
period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time the Fund 
may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement. 
If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop, a Fund 
might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to sell. 

The Funds may invest in commercial 
paper issued in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by 
Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act and other restricted securities (i.e., 
other securities subject to restrictions on resale). Section 4(a)(2) 
commercial paper (“4(a)(2) paper”) is restricted as to disposition under federal 
securities law and is generally sold to institutional investors, such as the 
Funds, that agree that they are purchasing the paper for investment purposes and 
not with a view to public distribution. Any resale by the purchaser must be in 
an exempt transaction. 4(a)(2) paper is normally resold to other institutional 
investors through or with the assistance of the issuer or investment dealers who 
make a market in 4(a)(2) paper, thus providing liquidity. The Funds believe that 
4(a)(2) paper and possibly certain other restricted securities which meet the 
criteria for liquidity established by the Trustees are quite liquid. The Funds 
intend, therefore, to treat restricted securities that meet the liquidity 
criteria established by the Board of Trustees, including 4(a)(2) paper and Rule 
144A Securities, as determined by the Fund’s Adviser, as liquid and not subject 
to the investment limitation applicable to illiquid securities. 
The ability of the Trustees to 
determine the liquidity of certain restricted securities is permitted under an 
SEC Staff position set forth in the adopting release for Rule 144A under the 
1933 Act (“Rule 144A”). Rule 144A is a nonexclusive safe-harbor for certain 
secondary market transactions involving securities subject to restrictions on 
resale under federal securities laws. Rule 144A provides an exemption from 
registration for resales of otherwise restricted securities to qualified 
institutional buyers. Rule 144A was expected to further enhance the liquidity of 
the secondary market for securities eligible for resale. The Funds believe that 
the Staff of the SEC has left the question of determining the liquidity of all 
restricted securities to the Trustees. The Trustees have directed each Fund’s 
Adviser to consider the following criteria in determining the liquidity of 
certain restricted securities: 
 



 
•
 

the 
      frequency of trades and quotes for the security; 

 



 
•
 

the number 
      of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of 
      other potential buyers; 
 



 
•
 

dealer 
      undertakings to make a market in the security; and 
  
 



 
•
 

the nature 
      of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades. 
  
Certain 4(a)(2) paper programs 
cannot rely on Rule 144A because, among other things, they were established 
before the adoption of the rule. However, the Trustees may determine for 
purposes of the Trust’s liquidity requirements that an issue of 4(a)(2) paper is 
liquid if the following conditions, which are set forth in a 1994 SEC no-action letter, are met: 
 



 
•
 

The 
      4(a)(2) paper must not be traded flat or in default as to principal or 
      interest; 
 



 
•
 

The 
      4(a)(2) paper must be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by 
      at least two NRSROs, or if only one NRSRO rates the security, by that 
      NRSRO, or if unrated, is determined by a Fund’s Adviser to be of 
      equivalent quality; 
 



 
•
 

The Fund’s 
      Adviser must consider the trading market for the specific security, taking 
      into account all relevant factors, including but not limited to, whether 
      the paper is the subject of a commercial paper program that is 
      administered by an issuing and paying agent bank and for which there 
      exists a dealer willing to make a market in that paper, or whether the 
      paper is administered by a direct issuer pursuant to a direct placement 
      program; 
 
Part II - 28 





 
•
 

The Fund’s 
      Adviser shall monitor the liquidity of the 4(a)(2) paper purchased and 
      shall report to the Board of Trustees promptly if any such securities are 
      no longer determined to be liquid if such determination causes a Fund to 
      hold more than 10% of its net assets in illiquid securities in order for 
      the Board of Trustees to consider what action, if any, should be taken on 
      behalf of the Trust, unless the Fund’s Adviser is able to dispose of 
      illiquid assets in an orderly manner in an amount that reduces the Fund’s 
      holdings of illiquid assets to less than 10% of its net assets; and 
      
 



 
•
 

The Fund’s 
      Adviser shall report to the Board of Trustees on the appropriateness of 
      the purchase and retention of liquid restricted securities under these 
      guidelines no less frequently than quarterly. 

Securities Issued in Connection with Reorganizations 
and Corporate Restructuring. Debt securities may be downgraded and 
issuers of debt securities including investment grade securities may default in 
the payment of principal or interest or be subject to bankruptcy proceedings. In 
connection with reorganizing or restructuring of an issuer, an issuer may issue 
common stock or other securities to holders of its debt securities. A Fund may 
hold such common stock and other securities even though it does not ordinarily 
invest in such securities. 
Stapled Securities. From time to time, the Funds 
may invest in stapled securities to gain exposure to companies. A stapled 
security is a security that is comprised of two or more parts that cannot be 
separated from one another. The resulting security is influenced by both parts, 
and must be treated as one unit at all times, such as when buying or selling a 
security. The value of stapled securities and the income derived from them may 
fall as well as rise. Stapled securities are not obligations of, deposits in, or 
guaranteed by, the Fund. The listing of stapled securities on a domestic or 
foreign exchange does not guarantee a liquid market for stapled securities. 

Temporary Defensive Positions. To respond to 
unusual market conditions, all of the Funds may invest their assets in cash or 
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, high quality instruments 
with maturities of three months or less on the date they are purchased (“Cash 
Equivalents”) for temporary defensive purposes. These investments may result in 
a lower yield than lower-quality or longer term investments and may prevent the 
Funds from meeting their investment objectives. The percentage of Fund’s total 
assets that a Fund may invest in cash or cash equivalents is described in the 
applicable Fund’s Prospectuses. They include securities issued by the U.S. 
government, its agencies, Government-Sponsored Enterprises (“GSEs”) and 
instrumentalities, repurchase agreements with maturities of 7 days or less, 
certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, money market 
mutual funds, and bank deposit accounts. In order to invest in repurchase 
agreements with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for temporary defensive 
purposes, certain Funds may engage in periodic “test” trading in order to assess 
operational abilities at times when the Fund would otherwise not enter into such 
a position. These exercises may vary in size and frequency. 
Mortgage-Related Securities 
Mortgages (Directly Held). Mortgages are 
debt instruments secured by real property. Unlike mortgage-backed securities, 
which generally represent an interest in a pool of mortgages, direct investments 
in mortgages involve prepayment and credit risks of an individual issuer and 
real property. Consequently, these investments require different investment and 
credit analysis by a Fund’s Adviser. 
Directly placed mortgages may 
include residential mortgages, multifamily mortgages, mortgages on cooperative 
apartment buildings, commercial mortgages, and sale-leasebacks. These 
investments are backed by assets such as office buildings, shopping centers, 
retail stores, warehouses, apartment buildings and single-family dwellings. In 
the event that a Fund forecloses on any non-performing mortgage, and acquires a 
direct interest in the real property, such Fund will be subject to the risks 
generally associated with the ownership of real property. There may be 
fluctuations in the market value of the foreclosed property and its occupancy 
rates, rent schedules and operating expenses. There may also be adverse changes 
in local, regional or general economic conditions, deterioration of the real 
estate market and the financial circumstances of tenants and sellers, 
unfavorable changes in zoning, building, environmental and other laws, increased 
real property taxes, rising interest rates, reduced availability and increased 
cost of mortgage borrowings, the need for unanticipated renovations, unexpected 
increases in the cost of energy, environmental factors, acts of God and other 
factors which are beyond the control of a Fund or the Fund’s Adviser. Hazardous 
or toxic substances may be present on, at or under the mortgaged property and 
adversely affect the value of the property. In addition, the owners of property 
containing such substances may be held responsible, under various laws, for 
containing, monitoring, removing or cleaning up such substances. The presence of 
such substances may also provide a basis for other claims by third parties. 
Costs of clean up or of liabilities to third parties may exceed the value of the 
property. In addition, these risks may be uninsurable. In light of these and 
similar risks, it may be impossible to dispose profitably of properties in 
foreclosure. 
Mortgage-Backed Securities (“CMOs” and 
“REMICs”). Mortgage-backed securities include collateralized mortgage 
obligations (“CMOs”) and Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (“REMICs”). A 
REMIC is a CMO 
 
Part II - 29 


that qualifies for special tax 
treatment under the Code and invests in certain mortgages principally secured by 
interests in real property and other permitted investments. 
Mortgage-backed securities represent 
pools of mortgage loans assembled for sale to investors by: 
 



 
•
 

various 
      governmental agencies such as the Government National Mortgage Association 
      (“Ginnie Mae”); 
 



 
•
 

organizations such as the Federal National Mortgage Association 
      (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie 
      Mac”); and 
 



 
•
 

non-governmental issuers such as 
      commercial banks, savings and loan institutions, mortgage bankers, and 
      private mortgage insurance companies (non-governmental mortgage securities 
      cannot be treated as U.S. government securities for purposes of investment 
      policies). 
There are a number of important 
differences among the agencies, GSEs and instrumentalities of the U.S. 
government that issue mortgage-related securities and among the securities that 
they issue. 
Ginnie Mae Securities. 
Mortgage-related securities issued by Ginnie Mae include Ginnie Mae Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates which are guaranteed as to the timely payment of 
principal and interest by Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae’s guarantee is backed by the 
full faith and credit of the U.S. Ginnie Mae is a wholly-owned U.S. government 
corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae 
certificates also are supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae to borrow funds 
from the U.S. Treasury to make payments under its guarantee. 
Fannie Mae Securities. 
Mortgage-related securities issued by Fannie Mae include Fannie Mae 
Guaranteed Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates which are solely the obligations 
of Fannie Mae and are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of 
the U.S. Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored organization owned entirely by 
private stockholders. Fannie Mae Certificates are guaranteed as to timely 
payment of the principal and interest by Fannie Mae. 
Freddie Mac Securities. 
Mortgage-related securities issued by Freddie Mac include Freddie Mac 
Mortgage Participation Certificates. Freddie Mac is a corporate instrumentality 
of the U.S., created pursuant to an Act of Congress, which is owned by private 
stockholders. Freddie Mac Certificates are not guaranteed by the U.S. or by any 
Federal Home Loan Bank and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the U.S. or 
of any Federal Home Loan Bank. Freddie Mac Certificates entitle the holder to 
timely payment of interest, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac 
guarantees either ultimate collection or timely payment of all principal 
payments on the underlying mortgage loans. When Freddie Mac does not guarantee 
timely payment of principal, Freddie Mac may remit the amount due on account of 
its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time after default on an 
underlying mortgage, but in no event later than one year after it becomes 
payable. 
For more information on recent 
events impacting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, see “Recent Events 
Regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Securities” under the heading “Risk 
Factors of Mortgage-Related Securities” below. 
CMOs and guaranteed REMIC 
pass-through certificates (“REMIC Certificates”) issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, Ginnie Mae and private issuers are types of multiple class pass-through 
securities. Investors may purchase beneficial interests in REMICs, which are 
known as “regular” interests or “residual” interests. The Funds do not currently 
intend to purchase residual interests in REMICs. The REMIC Certificates 
represent beneficial ownership interests in a REMIC Trust, generally consisting 
of mortgage loans or Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae guaranteed mortgage 
pass-through certificates (the “Mortgage Assets”). The obligations of Fannie 
Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae under their respective guaranty of the REMIC 
Certificates are obligations solely of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, 
respectively. 
Fannie Mae REMIC Certificates. 
Fannie Mae REMIC Certificates are issued and guaranteed as to timely 
distribution of principal and interest by Fannie Mae. In addition, Fannie Mae 
will be obligated to distribute the principal balance of each class of REMIC 
Certificates in full, whether or not sufficient funds are otherwise available. 

Freddie Mac REMIC Certificates. 
Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest, and also guarantees 
the payment of principal as payments are required to be made on the underlying 
mortgage participation certificates (“PCs”). PCs represent undivided interests 
in specified residential mortgages or participation therein purchased by Freddie 
Mac and placed in a PC pool. With respect to principal payments on 
 
Part II - 30 


PCs, Freddie Mac generally 
guarantees ultimate collection of all principal of the related mortgage loans 
without offset or deduction. Freddie Mac also guarantees timely payment of 
principal on certain PCs referred to as “Gold PCs.” 
Ginnie Mae REMIC Certificates. 
Ginnie Mae guarantees the full and timely payment of interest and principal 
on each class of securities (in accordance with the terms of those classes as 
specified in the related offering circular supplement). The Ginnie Mae guarantee 
is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. 
REMIC Certificates issued by Fannie 
Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are treated as U.S. Government securities for 
purposes of investment policies. 
CMOs and REMIC Certificates provide 
for the redistribution of cash flow to multiple classes. Each class of CMOs or 
REMIC Certificates, often referred to as a “tranche,” is issued at a specific 
adjustable or fixed interest rate and must be fully retired no later than its 
final distribution date. This reallocation of interest and principal results in 
the redistribution of prepayment risk across different classes. This allows for 
the creation of bonds with more or less risk than the underlying collateral 
exhibits. Principal prepayments on the mortgage loans or the Mortgage Assets 
underlying the CMOs or REMIC Certificates may cause some or all of the classes 
of CMOs or REMIC Certificates to be retired substantially earlier than their 
final distribution dates. Generally, interest is paid or accrues on all classes 
of CMOs or REMIC Certificates on a monthly basis. 
The principal of and interest on the 
Mortgage Assets may be allocated among the several classes of CMOs or REMIC 
Certificates in various ways. In certain structures (known as “sequential pay” 
CMOs or REMIC Certificates), payments of principal, including any principal 
prepayments, on the Mortgage Assets generally are applied to the classes of CMOs 
or REMIC Certificates in the order of their respective final distribution dates. 
Thus, no payment of principal will be made on any class of sequential pay CMOs 
or REMIC Certificates until all other classes having an earlier final 
distribution date have been paid in full. 
Additional structures of CMOs and 
REMIC Certificates include, among others, principal only structures, interest 
only structures, inverse floaters and “parallel pay” CMOs and REMIC 
Certificates. Certain of these structures may be more volatile than other types 
of CMO and REMIC structures. Parallel pay CMOs or REMIC Certificates are those 
which are structured to apply principal payments and prepayments of the Mortgage 
Assets to two or more classes concurrently on a proportionate or 
disproportionate basis. These simultaneous payments are taken into account in 
calculating the final distribution date of each class. 
A wide variety of REMIC Certificates 
may be issued in the parallel pay or sequential pay structures. These securities 
include accrual certificates (also known as “Z-Bonds”), which only accrue interest at a 
specified rate until all other certificates having an earlier final distribution 
date have been retired and are converted thereafter to an interest-paying 
security, and planned amortization class (“PAC”) certificates, which are 
parallel pay REMIC Certificates which generally require that specified amounts 
of principal be applied on each payment date to one or more classes of REMIC 
Certificates (the “PAC Certificates”), even though all other principal payments 
and prepayments of the Mortgage Assets are then required to be applied to one or 
more other classes of the certificates. The scheduled principal payments for the 
PAC Certificates generally have the highest priority on each payment date after 
interest due has been paid to all classes entitled to receive interest 
currently. Shortfalls, if any, are added to the amount of principal payable on 
the next payment date. The PAC Certificate payment schedule is taken into 
account in calculating the final distribution date of each class of PAC. In 
order to create PAC tranches, one or more tranches generally must be created 
that absorb most of the volatility in the underlying Mortgage Assets. These 
tranches tend to have market prices and yields that are much more volatile than 
the PAC classes. The Z-Bonds in which 
the Funds may invest may bear the same non-credit-related risks as do other types of 
Z-Bonds. Z-Bonds in which the Fund may invest will not 
include residual interest. 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 
set forth in the fee table and Financial Highlights section of each Fund’s 
Prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain 
structured or synthetic products that may rely on the exception for the 
definition of “investment company” provided by section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 
1940 Act. 
Mortgage TBAs. A Fund may invest in mortgage 
pass-through securities eligible to be sold in the “to-be-announced” or TBA market 
(“Mortgage TBAs”). Mortgage TBAs provide for the forward or delayed delivery of 
the underlying instrument with settlement up to 180 days. The term TBA comes 
from the fact that the actual mortgage-backed security that will be delivered to 
fulfill a TBA trade is not designated at the time the trade is made, but rather 
is generally announced 48 hours before the settlement date. Mortgage TBAs are 
subject to the risks described in the “When-Issued Securities, Delayed Delivery 
Securities and Forward Commitments” section. 
 
Part II - 31 


Mortgage Dollar Rolls. In a mortgage dollar roll 
transaction, one party sells mortgage-backed securities, principally Mortgage 
TBAs, for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts with the 
same counterparty to repurchase similar (same type, coupon and maturity) but not 
identical securities on a specified future date. When a Fund enters into 
TBAs/mortgage dollar rolls, the Fund will segregate or earmark until the 
settlement date liquid assets, in an amount equal to the original purchase 
price. TBA positions with the same agency, coupon, and maturity, are generally 
permitted to be netted if the short position settles on the same date or before 
the long position. During the period between the sale and repurchase in a 
mortgage dollar roll transaction, the Fund will not be entitled to receive 
interest and principal payments on securities sold. Losses may arise due to 
changes in the value of the securities or if the counterparty does not perform 
under the terms of the agreement. If the counterparty files for bankruptcy or 
becomes insolvent, the Fund’s right to repurchase or sell securities may be 
limited. Mortgage dollar rolls may be subject to leverage risks. In addition, 
mortgage dollar rolls may increase interest rate risk and result in an increased 
portfolio turnover rate which increases costs and may increase taxable 
gains. The benefits of mortgage dollar rolls may depend upon a Fund’s 
Adviser’s ability to predict mortgage prepayments and interest rates. There is 
no assurance that mortgage dollar rolls can be successfully employed. For 
purposes of diversification and investment limitations, mortgage dollar rolls 
are considered to be mortgage-backed securities. 
Stripped Mortgage-Backed Securities. Stripped 
Mortgage-Backed Securities (“SMBS”) are derivative multi-class mortgage 
securities issued outside the REMIC or CMO structure. SMBS are usually 
structured with two classes that receive different proportions of the interest 
and principal distributions from a pool of mortgage assets. A common type of 
SMBS will have one class receiving all of the interest from the mortgage assets 
(“IOs”), while the other class will receive all of the principal (“POs”). 
Mortgage IOs receive monthly interest payments based upon a notional amount that 
declines over time as a result of the normal monthly amortization and 
unscheduled prepayments of principal on the associated mortgage POs. 
In addition to the risks applicable 
to Mortgage-Related Securities in general, SMBS are subject to the following 
additional risks: 
Prepayment/Interest Rate 
Sensitivity. SMBS are extremely sensitive to changes in prepayments and 
interest rates. Even though these securities have been guaranteed by an agency 
or instrumentality of the U.S. government, under certain interest rate or 
prepayment rate scenarios, the Funds may lose money on investments in SMBS. 

Interest Only SMBS. Changes 
in prepayment rates can cause the return on investment in IOs to be highly 
volatile. Under extremely high prepayment conditions, IOs can incur significant 
losses. 
Principal Only SMBS. POs are 
bought at a discount to the ultimate principal repayment value. The rate of 
return on a PO will vary with prepayments, rising as prepayments increase and 
falling as prepayments decrease. Generally, the market value of these securities 
is unusually volatile in response to changes in interest rates. 
Yield Characteristics. 
Although SMBS may yield more than other mortgage-backed securities, their 
cash flow patterns are more volatile and there is a greater risk that any 
premium paid will not be fully recouped. A Fund’s Adviser will seek to manage 
these risks (and potential benefits) by investing in a variety of such 
securities and by using certain analytical and hedging techniques. 
Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans. Certain 
Funds may invest in adjustable rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”). ARMs eligible for 
inclusion in a mortgage pool will generally provide for a fixed initial mortgage 
interest rate for a specified period of time. Thereafter, the interest rates 
(the “Mortgage Interest Rates”) may be subject to periodic adjustment based on 
changes in the applicable index rate (the “Index Rate”). The adjusted rate would 
be equal to the Index Rate plus a gross margin, which is a fixed percentage 
spread over the Index Rate established for each ARM at the time of its 
origination. 
Adjustable interest rates can cause 
payment increases that some borrowers may find difficult to make. However, 
certain ARMs may provide that the Mortgage Interest Rate may not be adjusted to 
a rate above an applicable lifetime maximum rate or below an applicable lifetime 
minimum rate for such ARM. Certain ARMs may also be subject to limitations on 
the maximum amount by which the Mortgage Interest Rate may adjust for any single 
adjustment period (the “Maximum Adjustment”). Other ARMs (“Negatively Amortizing 
ARMs”) may provide instead or as well for limitations on changes in the monthly 
payment on such ARMs. Limitations on monthly payments can result in monthly 
payments which are greater or less than the amount necessary to amortize a 
Negatively Amortizing ARM by its maturity at the Mortgage Interest Rate in 
effect in any particular month. In the event that a monthly payment is not 
sufficient to pay the interest accruing on a Negatively Amortizing ARM, any such 
excess interest is added to the principal balance of the loan, causing negative 
amortization and will be repaid through future monthly payments. It may take 
borrowers under Negatively Amortizing ARMs longer periods of 
 
Part II - 32 


time to achieve equity and may 
increase the likelihood of default by such borrowers. In the event that a 
monthly payment exceeds the sum of the interest accrued at the applicable 
Mortgage Interest Rate and the principal payment which would have been necessary 
to amortize the outstanding principal balance over the remaining term of the 
loan, the excess (or “accelerated amortization”) further reduces the principal 
balance of the ARM. Negatively Amortizing ARMs do not provide for the extension 
of their original maturity to accommodate changes in their Mortgage Interest 
Rate. As a result, unless there is a periodic recalculation of the payment 
amount (which there generally is), the final payment may be substantially larger 
than the other payments. These limitations on periodic increases in interest 
rates and on changes in monthly payments protect borrowers from unlimited 
interest rate and payment increases. 
Certain ARMs may provide for 
periodic adjustments of scheduled payments in order to amortize fully the 
mortgage loan by its stated maturity. Other ARMs may permit their stated 
maturity to be extended or shortened in accordance with the portion of each 
payment that is applied to interest as affected by the periodic interest rate 
adjustments. 
There are two main categories of 
indices which provide the basis for rate adjustments on ARMs: those based on 
U.S. Treasury securities and those derived from a calculated measure such as a 
cost of funds index or a moving average of mortgage rates. Commonly utilized 
indices include the one-year, 
three-year and five-year constant maturity Treasury bill rates, the three-month 
Treasury bill rate, the 180-day 
Treasury bill rate, rates on longer-term Treasury securities, the 11th District 
Federal Home Loan Bank Cost of Funds, the National Median Cost of Funds, the 
one-month, three-month, six-month or one-year London InterBank Offered Rate 
(“LIBOR”), the prime rate of a specific bank, or commercial paper rates. Some 
indices, such as the one-year constant 
maturity Treasury rate, closely mirror changes in market interest rate levels. 
Others, such as the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank Cost of Funds index, 
tend to lag behind changes in market rate levels and tend to be somewhat less 
volatile. The degree of volatility in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio 
and therefore in the net asset value of the Fund’s shares will be a function of 
the length of the interest rate reset periods and the degree of volatility in 
the applicable indices. 
In general, changes in both 
prepayment rates and interest rates will change the yield on Mortgage-Backed 
Securities. The rate of principal prepayments with respect to ARMs has 
fluctuated in recent years. As is the case with fixed mortgage loans, ARMs may 
be subject to a greater rate of principal prepayments in a declining interest 
rate environment. For example, if prevailing interest rates fall significantly, 
ARMs could be subject to higher prepayment rates than if prevailing interest 
rates remain constant because the availability of fixed rate mortgage loans at 
competitive interest rates may encourage mortgagors to refinance their ARMs to 
“lock-in” a lower fixed interest rate. 
Conversely, if prevailing interest rates rise significantly, ARMs may prepay at 
lower rates than if prevailing rates remain at or below those in effect at the 
time such ARMs were originated. As with fixed rate mortgages, there can be no 
certainty as to the rate of prepayments on the ARMs in either stable or changing 
interest rate environments. In addition, there can be no certainty as to whether 
increases in the principal balances of the ARMs due to the addition of deferred 
interest may result in a default rate higher than that on ARMs that do not 
provide for negative amortization. 
Other factors affecting prepayment 
of ARMs include changes in mortgagors’ housing needs, job transfers, 
unemployment, mortgagors’ net equity in the mortgage properties and servicing 
decisions. 
Risk 
Factors of Mortgage-Related Securities. The following is a summary of 
certain risks associated with Mortgage-Related Securities: 
Guarantor Risk. There can be 
no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to Fannie 
Mae or Freddie Mac if necessary in the future. Although certain mortgage-related 
securities are guaranteed by a third party or otherwise similarly secured, the 
market value of the security, which may fluctuate, is not so secured. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. If 
a Fund purchases a mortgage-related security at a premium, that portion may be 
lost if there is a decline in the market value of the security whether resulting 
from changes in interest rates or prepayments in the underlying mortgage 
collateral. As with other interest-bearing securities, the prices of such 
securities are inversely affected by changes in interest rates. Although the 
value of a mortgage-related security may decline when interest rates rise, the 
converse is not necessarily true since in periods of declining interest rates 
the mortgages underlying the securities are prone to prepayment. For this and 
other reasons, a mortgage-related security’s stated maturity may be shortened by 
unscheduled prepayments on the underlying mortgages and, therefore, it is not 
possible to predict accurately the security’s return to the Fund. In addition, 
regular payments received in respect of mortgage-related securities include both 
interest and principal. No assurance can be given as to the return the Fund will 
receive when these amounts are reinvested. 
Liquidity. The liquidity of 
certain mortgage-backed securities varies by type of security; at certain times 
the Fund may encounter difficulty in disposing of such investments. In the past, 
in stressed markets, certain types of mortgage-
 
Part II - 33 


backed securities suffered periods 
of illiquidity when disfavored by the market. It is possible that the Fund may 
be unable to sell a mortgage-backed security at a desirable time or at the value 
the Fund has placed on the investment. 
Market Value. The market 
value of the Fund’s adjustable rate Mortgage-Backed Securities may be adversely 
affected if interest rates increase faster than the rates of interest payable on 
such securities or by the adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying such 
securities. Furthermore, adjustable rate Mortgage-Backed Securities or the 
mortgage loans underlying such securities may contain provisions limiting the 
amount by which rates may be adjusted upward and downward and may limit the 
amount by which monthly payments may be increased or decreased to accommodate 
upward and downward adjustments in interest rates. When the market value of the 
properties underlying the Mortgage-Backed Securities suffer broad declines on a 
regional or national level, the values of the corresponding Mortgage-Backed 
Securities or Mortgage-Backed Securities as a whole, may be adversely affected 
as well. 
Prepayments. Adjustable rate 
Mortgage-Backed Securities have less potential for capital appreciation than 
fixed rate Mortgage-Backed Securities because their coupon rates will decline in 
response to market interest rate declines. The market value of fixed rate 
Mortgage-Backed Securities may be adversely affected as a result of increases in 
interest rates and, because of the risk of unscheduled principal prepayments, 
may benefit less than other fixed rate securities of similar maturity from 
declining interest rates. Finally, to the extent Mortgage-Backed Securities are 
purchased at a premium, mortgage foreclosures and unscheduled principal 
prepayments may result in some loss of the Fund’s principal investment to the 
extent of the premium paid. On the other hand, if such securities are purchased 
at a discount, both a scheduled payment of principal and an unscheduled 
prepayment of principal will increase current and total returns and will 
accelerate the recognition of income. 
Yield Characteristics. The 
yield characteristics of Mortgage-Backed Securities differ from those of 
traditional fixed income securities. The major differences typically include 
more frequent interest and principal payments, usually monthly, and the 
possibility that prepayments of principal may be made at any time. Prepayment 
rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of 
economic, geographic, social and other factors and cannot be predicted with 
certainty. As with fixed rate mortgage loans, adjustable rate mortgage loans may 
be subject to a greater prepayment rate in a declining interest rate 
environment. The yields to maturity of the Mortgage-Backed Securities in which 
the Funds invest will be affected by the actual rate of payment (including 
prepayments) of principal of the underlying mortgage loans. The mortgage loans 
underlying such securities generally may be prepaid at any time without penalty. 
In a fluctuating interest rate environment, a predominant factor affecting the 
prepayment rate on a pool of mortgage loans is the difference between the 
interest rates on the mortgage loans and prevailing mortgage loan interest rates 
taking into account the cost of any refinancing. In general, if mortgage loan 
interest rates fall sufficiently below the interest rates on fixed rate mortgage 
loans underlying mortgage pass-through securities, the rate of prepayment would 
be expected to increase. Conversely, if mortgage loan interest rates rise above 
the interest rates on the fixed rate mortgage loans underlying the mortgage 
pass-through securities, the rate of prepayment may be expected to decrease. 

Recent Events Regarding Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac Securities. On September 6, 2008, the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into 
conservatorship. As the conservator, FHFA succeeded to all rights, titles, 
powers and privileges of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and of any stockholder, 
officer or director of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with respect to Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac and the assets of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA selected a new 
chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors for each of 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In connection with the conservatorship, the U.S. 
Treasury entered into a Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with each of 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury will purchase up 
to an aggregate of $100 billion of each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to 
maintain a positive net worth in each enterprise. This agreement contains 
various covenants, discussed below, that severely limit each enterprise’s 
operations. In exchange for entering into these agreements, the U.S. Treasury 
received $1 billion of each enterprise’s senior preferred stock and warrants to 
purchase 79.9% of each enterprise’s common stock. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury 
announced that it was doubling the size of its commitment to each enterprise 
under the Senior Preferred Stock Program to $200 billion. The U.S. Treasury’s 
obligations under the Senior Preferred Stock Program are for an indefinite 
period of time for a maximum amount of $200 billion per enterprise. In 2009, the 
U.S. Treasury further amended the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement to 
allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury’s funding commitment to increase as necessary 
to accommodate any cumulative reduction in Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s net 
worth through the end of 2012. In August 2012, the Senior Preferred Stock 
Purchase Agreement was further amended to, among other things, accelerate the 
wind down of the retained portfolio, terminate the requirement that Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend annually on all amounts received under 
the funding commitment, and require the submission of an annual risk management 
plan to the U.S. Treasury. 
 
Part II - 34 


Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are 
continuing to operate as going concerns while in conservatorship and each remain 
liable for all of its obligations, including its guaranty obligations, 
associated with its mortgage-backed securities. The Senior Preferred Stock 
Purchase Agreement is intended to enhance each of Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s 
ability to meet its obligations. The FHFA has indicated that the conservatorship 
of each enterprise will end when the director of FHFA determines that FHFA’s 
plan to restore the enterprise to a safe and solvent condition has been 
completed. 
Under the Federal Housing Finance 
Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 (the “Reform Act”), which was included as 
part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, FHFA, as conservator or 
receiver, has the power to repudiate any contract entered into by Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac prior to FHFA’s appointment as conservator or receiver, as 
applicable, if FHFA determines, in its sole discretion, that performance of the 
contract is burdensome and that repudiation of the contract promotes the orderly 
administration of Fannie Mae’s or Freddie Mac’s affairs. The Reform Act requires 
FHFA to exercise its right to repudiate any contract within a reasonable period 
of time after its appointment as conservator or receiver. FHFA, in its capacity 
as conservator, has indicated that it has no intention to repudiate the guaranty 
obligations of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac because FHFA views repudiation as 
incompatible with the goals of the conservatorship. However, in the event that 
FHFA, as conservator or if it is later appointed as receiver for Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac, were to repudiate any such guaranty obligation, the conservatorship 
or receivership estate, as applicable, would be liable for actual direct 
compensatory damages in accordance with the provisions of the Reform Act. Any 
such liability could be satisfied only to the extent of Fannie Mae’s or Freddie 
Mac’s assets available therefor. In the event of repudiation, the payments of 
interest to holders of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities 
would be reduced if payments on the mortgage loans represented in the mortgage 
loan groups related to such mortgage-backed securities are not made by the 
borrowers or advanced by the servicer. Any actual direct compensatory damages 
for repudiating these guaranty obligations may not be sufficient to offset any 
shortfalls experienced by such mortgage-backed security holders. Further, in its 
capacity as conservator or receiver, FHFA has the right to transfer or sell any 
asset or liability of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac without any approval, assignment 
or consent. Although FHFA has stated that it has no present intention to do so, 
if FHFA, as conservator or receiver, were to transfer any such guaranty 
obligation to another party, holders of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac 
mortgage-backed securities would have to rely on that party for satisfaction of 
the guaranty obligation and would be exposed to the credit risk of that party. 

In addition, certain rights provided 
to holders of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
under the operative documents related to such securities may not be enforced 
against FHFA, or enforcement of such rights may be delayed, during the 
conservatorship or any future receivership. The operative documents for Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities may provide (or with respect to 
securities issued prior to the date of the appointment of the conservator may 
have provided) that upon the occurrence of an event of default on the part of 
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, in its capacity as guarantor, which includes the 
appointment of a conservator or receiver, holders of such mortgage-backed 
securities have the right to replace Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac as trustee if the 
requisite percentage of mortgage-backed securities holders consent. The Reform 
Act prevents mortgage-backed security holders from enforcing such rights if the 
event of default arises solely because a conservator or receiver has been 
appointed. The Reform Act also provides that no person may exercise any right or 
power to terminate, accelerate or declare an event of default under certain 
contracts to which Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac is a party, or obtain possession of 
or exercise control over any property of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or affect 
any contractual rights of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, without the approval of 
FHFA, as conservator or receiver, for a period of 45 or 90 days following the 
appointment of FHFA as conservator or receiver, respectively. 
In addition, in a February 2011 
report to Congress from the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, the Obama administration provided a plan to reform 
America’s housing finance market. The plan would reduce the role of and 
eventually eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Notably, the plan does not 
propose similar significant changes to Ginnie Mae, which guarantees payments on 
mortgage-related securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans such 
as those issued by the Federal Housing Association or guaranteed by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. The report also identified three proposals for 
Congress and the administration to consider for the long-term structure of the 
housing finance markets after the elimination of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
including implementing: (i) a privatized system of housing finance that 
limits government insurance to very limited groups of creditworthy low- and 
moderate-income borrowers; (ii) a privatized system with a government 
backstop mechanism that would allow the government to insure a larger share of 
the housing finance market during a future housing crisis; and (iii) a 
privatized system where the government would offer reinsurance to holders of 
certain highly-rated mortgage-related securities insured by private insurers and 
would pay out under the reinsurance arrangements only if the private mortgage 
insurers were insolvent. 
 
Part II - 35 


The conditions attached to the 
financial contribution made by the Treasury to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and 
the issuance of senior preferred stock place significant restrictions on the 
activities of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae must obtain 
the consent of the Treasury to, among other things, (i) make any payment to 
purchase or redeem its capital stock or pay any dividend other than in respect 
of the senior preferred stock, (ii) issue capital stock of any kind, (iii) 
terminate the conservatorship of the FHFA except in connection with a 
receivership, or (iv) increase its debt beyond certain specified levels. In 
addition, significant restrictions are placed on the maximum size of each of 
Freddie Mac’s and Fannie Mae’s respective portfolios of mortgages and 
mortgage-backed securities, and the purchase agreements entered into by Freddie 
Mac and Fannie Mae provide that the maximum size of their portfolios of these 
assets must decrease by a specified percentage each year. The future status and 
role of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be impacted by (among other things) the 
actions taken and restrictions placed on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae by the FHFA 
in is role as conservator, the restrictions placed on Freddie Mac’s and Fannie 
Mae’s operations and activities as a result of the senior preferred stock 
investment made by the U.S. Treasury, market responses to developments at 
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mac, and future legislative and regulatory action that 
alters the operations, ownership, structure and/or mission of these 
institutions, each of which may, in turn, impact the value of, and cash flows 
on, any mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, 
including any such mortgage-backed securities held by a Fund. 
Municipal Securities 
Municipal Securities are issued to 
obtain funds for a wide variety of reasons. For example, municipal securities 
may be issued to obtain funding for the construction of a wide range of public 
facilities such as: 
 



 
1.
bridges; 
 



 
2.
highways; 
 



 
3.
roads; 
 



 
4.
schools; 
 



 
5.
waterworks and sewer systems; and 
 



 
6.
other utilities. 
Other public purposes for which 
Municipal Securities may be issued include: 
 



 
1.
refunding outstanding obligations; 
 



 
2.
obtaining funds for general operating expenses; and 
  
 



 
3.
obtaining funds to lend to other public institutions and 
      facilities. 
In addition, certain debt 
obligations known as “Private Activity Bonds” may be issued by or on behalf of 
municipalities and public authorities to obtain funds to provide: 
 



 
1.
water, sewage and solid waste facilities; 

 



 
2.
qualified residential rental projects; 
 



 
3.
certain local electric, gas and other heating or cooling 
      facilities; 
 



 
4.

Certain debt obligations known as 
“Industrial Development Bonds” under prior Federal tax law may have been issued 
by or on behalf of public authorities to obtain funds to provide: 
 



 
1.
privately operated housing facilities; 
 



 
2.
sports facilities; 
 
Part II - 36 





 
3.
industrial parks; 
 



 
4.
convention or trade show facilities; 
 



 
5.
airport, mass transit, port or parking facilities; 
  
 



 
6.
air or water pollution control facilities; 

 



 
7.
sewage or solid waste disposal facilities; and 

 



 
8.
facilities for water supply. 
Other private activity bonds and 
industrial development bonds issued to fund the construction, improvement, 
equipment or repair of privately-operated industrial, distribution, research, or 
commercial facilities may also be Municipal Securities, however the size of such 
issues is limited under current and prior Federal tax law. The aggregate amount 
of most private activity bonds and industrial development bonds is limited 
(except in the case of certain types of facilities) under Federal tax law by an 
annual “volume cap.” The volume cap limits the annual aggregate principal amount 
of such obligations issued by or on behalf of all governmental instrumentalities 
in the state. 
The two principal classifications of 
Municipal Securities consist of “general obligation” and “limited” (or revenue) 
issues. General obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an 
issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from the issuer’s general 
unrestricted revenues and not from any particular fund or source. The 
characteristics and method of enforcement of general obligation bonds vary 
according to the law applicable to the particular issuer, and payment may be 
dependent upon appropriation by the issuer’s legislative body. Limited 
obligation bonds are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular 
facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a 
special excise or other specific revenue source. Private activity bonds and 
industrial development bonds generally are revenue bonds and thus not payable 
from the unrestricted revenues of the issuer. The credit and quality of such 
bonds is generally related to the credit of the bank selected to provide the 
letter of credit underlying the bond. Payment of principal of and interest on 
industrial development revenue bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user 
(and any guarantor). 
The Funds may also acquire “moral 
obligation” issues, which are normally issued by special purpose authorities, 
and in other tax-exempt investments 
including pollution control bonds and tax-exempt commercial paper. Each Fund that 
may purchase municipal bonds may purchase: 
 



 
1.
Short-term tax-exempt 
      General Obligations Notes; 
 



 
2.
Tax Anticipation Notes; 
 



 
3.
Bond Anticipation Notes; 
 



 
4.
Revenue Anticipation Notes; 
 



 
5.
Project Notes; and 
 



 
6.
Other forms of short-term tax-exempt loans. 

Such notes are issued with a 
short-term maturity in anticipation of the receipt of tax funds, the proceeds of 
bond placements, or other revenues. Project Notes are issued by a state or local 
housing agency and are sold by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
While the issuing agency has the primary obligation with respect to its Project 
Notes, they are also secured by the full faith and credit of the U.S. through 
agreements with the issuing authority which provide that, if required, the 
Federal government will lend the issuer an amount equal to the principal of and 
interest on the Project Notes. 
There are, of course, variations in 
the quality of Municipal Securities, both within a particular classification and 
between classifications. Also, the yields on Municipal Securities depend upon a 
variety of factors, including: 
 



 
1.
general money market conditions; 
 



 
2.
coupon rate; 
 



 
3.
the financial condition of the issuer; 
 



 
4.
general conditions of the municipal bond market; 
  
 



 
5.
the size of a particular offering; 
 



 
6.
the maturity of the obligations; and 
 



 
7.
the rating of the issue. 
 
Part II - 37 


The ratings of Moody’s and S&P 
represent their opinions as to the quality of Municipal Securities. However, 
ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality. Municipal 
Securities with the same maturity, interest rate and rating may have different 
yields while Municipal Securities of the same maturity and interest rate with 
different ratings may have the same yield. Subsequent to its purchase by a Fund, 
an issue of Municipal Securities may cease to be rated or its rating may be 
reduced below the minimum rating required for purchase by the Fund. The Adviser 
will consider such an event in determining whether the Fund should continue to 
hold the obligations. 
Municipal Securities may include 
obligations of municipal housing authorities and single-family mortgage revenue 
bonds. Weaknesses in Federal housing subsidy programs and their administration 
may result in a decrease of subsidies available for payment of principal and 
interest on housing authority bonds. Economic developments, including 
fluctuations in interest rates and increasing construction and operating costs, 
may also adversely impact revenues of housing authorities. In the case of some 
housing authorities, inability to obtain additional financing could also reduce 
revenues available to pay existing obligations. 
Single-family mortgage revenue bonds 
are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption at par in whole or in part 
from the proceeds derived from prepayments of underlying mortgage loans and also 
from the unused proceeds of the issue within a stated period which may be within 
a year from the date of issue. 
Municipal leases are obligations 
issued by state and local governments or authorities to finance the acquisition 
of equipment and facilities. Municipal leases may be considered to be illiquid. 
They may take the form of a lease, an installment purchase contract, a 
conditional sales contract, or a participation interest in any of the above. The 
Board of Trustees is responsible for determining the credit quality of unrated 
municipal leases on an ongoing basis, including an assessment of the likelihood 
that the lease will not be canceled. 
Premium Securities. During a 
period of declining interest rates, many Municipal Securities in which the Funds 
invest likely will bear coupon rates higher than current market rates, 
regardless of whether the securities were initially purchased at a premium. 

Risk 
Factors in Municipal Securities. The following is a summary of 
certain risks associated with Municipal Securities 
Tax Risk. The Code imposes 
certain continuing requirements on issuers of tax-exempt bonds regarding the use, 
expenditure and investment of bond proceeds and the payment of rebates to the 
U.S. Failure by the issuer to comply subsequent to the issuance of tax-exempt bonds with certain of these 
requirements could cause interest on the bonds to become includable in gross 
income retroactive to the date of issuance. 
Housing Authority Tax Risk. 
The exclusion from gross income for Federal income tax purposes for certain 
housing authority bonds depends on qualification under relevant provisions of 
the Code and on other provisions of Federal law. These provisions of Federal law 
contain requirements relating to the cost and location of the residences 
financed with the proceeds of the single-family mortgage bonds and the income 
levels of tenants of the rental projects financed with the proceeds of the 
multi-family housing bonds. Typically, the issuers of the bonds, and other 
parties, including the originators and servicers of the single-family mortgages 
and the owners of the rental projects financed with the multi-family housing 
bonds, covenant to meet these requirements. However, there is no assurance that 
the requirements will be met. If such requirements are not met: 
 



 
•
 

the 
      interest on the bonds may become taxable, possibly retroactively from the 
      date of issuance; 
 



 
•
 

the value 
      of the bonds may be reduced; 
 



 
•
 

you and 
      other Shareholders may be subject to unanticipated tax liabilities; 
      
 



 
•
 

a Fund may 
      be required to sell the bonds at the reduced value; 
  
 



 
•
 

it may be 
      an event of default under the applicable mortgage; 
  
 



 
•
 

the holder 
      may be permitted to accelerate payment of the bond; and 
  
 



 
•
 

the issuer 
      may be required to redeem the bond. 
In addition, if the mortgage 
securing the bonds is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), the 
consent of the FHA may be required before insurance proceeds would become 
payable. 
Information Risk. Information 
about the financial condition of issuers of Municipal Securities may be less 
available than that of corporations having a class of securities registered 
under the SEC. 
 
Part II - 38 


State and Federal Laws. An 
issuer’s obligations under its Municipal Securities are subject to the 
provisions of bankruptcy, insolvency, and other laws affecting the rights and 
remedies of creditors. These laws may extend the time for payment of principal 
or interest, or restrict the Fund’s ability to collect payments due on Municipal 
Securities. In addition, recent amendments to some statutes governing security 
interests (e.g., Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”)) 
change the way in which security interests and liens securing Municipal 
Securities are perfected. These amendments may have an adverse impact on 
existing Municipal Securities (particularly issues of Municipal Securities that 
do not have a corporate trustee who is responsible for filing UCC financing 
statements to continue the security interest or lien). 
Litigation and Current 
Developments. Litigation or other conditions may materially and adversely 
affect the power or ability of an issuer to meet its obligations for the payment 
of interest on and principal of its Municipal Securities. Such litigation or 
conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing uncertainties in 
the market for tax-exempt obligations, 
or may materially affect the credit risk with respect to particular bonds or 
notes. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect 
all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s Municipal Securities in the same 
manner. 
New Legislation. From time to 
time, proposals have been introduced before Congress for the purpose of 
restricting or eliminating the federal income tax exemption for interest on tax 
exempt bonds, and similar proposals may be introduced in the future. The Supreme 
Court has held that Congress has the constitutional authority to enact such 
legislation. It is not possible to determine what effect the adoption of such 
proposals could have on (i) the availability of Municipal Securities for 
investment by the Funds, and (ii) the value of the investment portfolios of 
the Funds. 
Limitations on the Use of Municipal Securities. 
Certain Funds may invest in Municipal Securities if the Adviser determines that 
such Municipal Securities offer attractive yields. The Funds may invest in 
Municipal Securities either by purchasing them directly or by purchasing 
certificates of accrual or similar instruments evidencing direct ownership of 
interest payments or principal payments, or both, on Municipal Securities, 
provided that, in the opinion of counsel to the initial seller of each such 
certificate or instrument, any discount accruing on such certificate or 
instrument that is purchased at a yield not greater than the coupon rate of 
interest on the related Municipal Securities will to the same extent as interest 
on such Municipal Securities be exempt from federal income tax and state income 
tax (where applicable) and not be treated as a preference item for individuals 
for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. The Funds may also invest 
in Municipal Securities by purchasing from banks participation interests in all 
or part of specific holdings of Municipal Securities. Such participation 
interests may be backed in whole or in part by an irrevocable letter of credit 
or guarantee of the selling bank. The selling bank may receive a fee from a Fund 
in connection with the arrangement. 
Each Fund will limit its investment 
in municipal leases to no more than 5% of its total assets. 
Options and Futures Transactions 
A Fund may purchase and sell 
(a) exchange traded and OTC put and call options on securities, on indexes 
of securities and other types of instruments, and on futures contracts on 
securities and indexes of securities and other instruments such as interest rate 
futures and global interest rate futures and (b) futures contracts on 
securities and other types of instruments and on indexes of securities and other 
types of instruments. Each of these instruments is a derivative instrument as 
its value derives from the underlying asset or index. 
Subject to its investment objective 
and policies, a Fund may use futures contracts and options for hedging and risk 
management purposes and to seek to enhance portfolio performance. 
Options and futures contracts may be 
used to manage a Fund’s exposure to changing interest rates and/or security 
prices. Some options and futures strategies, including selling futures contracts 
and buying puts, tend to hedge a Fund’s investments against price fluctuations. 
Other strategies, including buying futures contracts and buying calls, tend to 
increase market exposure. Options and futures contracts may be combined with 
each other or with forward contracts in order to adjust the risk and return 
characteristics of a Fund’s overall strategy in a manner deemed appropriate by 
the Fund’s Adviser and consistent with the Fund’s objective and policies. 
Because combined options positions involve multiple trades, they result in 
higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out. 

The use of options and futures is a 
highly specialized activity which involves investment strategies and risks 
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions, 
and there can be no guarantee that their use will increase a Fund’s return. 
While the use of these instruments by a Fund may reduce certain risks associated 
with owning its portfolio securities, these techniques themselves entail certain 
other risks. If a Fund’s Adviser applies 
 
Part II - 39 


a strategy at an inappropriate time 
or judges market conditions or trends incorrectly, options and futures 
strategies may lower a Fund’s return. Certain strategies limit a Fund’s 
possibilities to realize gains, as well as its exposure to losses. A Fund could 
also experience losses if the prices of its options and futures positions were 
poorly correlated with its other investments, or if it could not close out its 
positions because of an illiquid secondary market. In addition, the Fund will 
incur transaction costs, including trading commissions and option premiums, in 
connection with its futures and options transactions, and these transactions 
could significantly increase the Fund’s turnover rate. 
Certain Funds have filed a notice 
under the Commodity Exchange Act under Regulation 4.5 and are operated by a 
person that has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity 
pool operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act and, therefore, is not subject 
to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the Commodity Exchange 
Act. Certain other Funds may rely on no action relief issued by the CFTC. 

Purchasing Put and Call Options. By purchasing a 
put option, a Fund obtains the right (but not the obligation) to sell the 
instrument underlying the option at a fixed strike price. In return for this 
right, a Fund pays the current market price for the option (known as the option 
premium). Options have various types of underlying instruments, including 
specific securities, indexes of securities, indexes of securities prices, and 
futures contracts. A Fund may terminate its position in a put option it has 
purchased by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option. A Fund may also 
close out a put option position by entering into an offsetting transaction, if a 
liquid market exists. If the option is allowed to expire, a Fund will lose the 
entire premium it paid. If a Fund exercises a put option on a security, it will 
sell the instrument underlying the option at the strike price. If a Fund 
exercises an option on an index, settlement is in cash and does not involve the 
actual purchase or sale of securities. If an option is American style, it may be 
exercised on any day up to its expiration date. A European style option may be 
exercised only on its expiration date. 
The buyer of a typical put option 
can expect to realize a gain if the value of the underlying instrument falls 
substantially. However, if the price of the instrument underlying the option 
does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option, a put buyer 
can expect to suffer a loss (limited to the amount of the premium paid, plus 
related transaction costs). 
The features of call options are 
essentially the same as those of put options, except that the purchaser of a 
call option obtains the right to purchase, rather than sell, the instrument 
underlying the option at the option’s strike price. A call buyer typically 
attempts to participate in potential price increases of the instrument 
underlying the option with risk limited to the cost of the option if security 
prices fall. At the same time, the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security 
prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option. 
Selling (Writing) Put and Call Options on Securities. 
When a Fund writes a put option on a security, it takes the opposite side of 
the transaction from the option’s purchaser. In return for the receipt of the 
premium, a Fund assumes the obligation to pay the strike price for the security 
underlying the option if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it. A 
Fund may seek to terminate its position in a put option it writes before 
exercise by purchasing an offsetting option in the market at its current price. 
If the market is not liquid for a put option a Fund has written, however, it 
must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is 
outstanding, regardless of price changes, and must continue to post margin as 
discussed below. If the market value of the underlying securities does not move 
to a level that would make exercise of the option profitable to its holder, the 
option will generally expire unexercised, and the Fund will realize as profit 
the premium it received. 
If the price of the underlying 
securities rises, a put writer would generally expect to profit, although its 
gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received. If security 
prices remain the same over time, it is likely that the writer will also profit, 
because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price. If security 
prices fall, the put writer would expect to suffer a loss. This loss should be 
less than the loss from purchasing and holding the underlying security directly, 
however, because the premium received for writing the option should offset a 
portion of the decline. 
Writing a call option obligates a 
Fund to sell or deliver the option’s underlying security in return for the 
strike price upon exercise of the option. The characteristics of writing call 
options are similar to those of writing put options, except that writing calls 
generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall. Through 
receipt of the option premium a call writer offsets part of the effect of a 
price decline. At the same time, because a call writer must be prepared to 
deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price, even if its 
current value is greater, a call writer gives up some ability to participate in 
security price increases. 
In order to meet its asset coverage 
requirements, when a Fund writes an exchange traded put or call option on a 
security, it will be required to deposit cash or securities or a letter of 
credit as margin and to make mark to market payments of variation margin as the 
position becomes unprofitable. 
 
Part II - 40 


Certain Funds will usually sell 
covered call options or cash-secured put options on securities. A call option is 
covered if the writer either owns the underlying security (or comparable 
securities satisfying the cover requirements of the securities exchanges) or has 
the right to acquire such securities. A put option is cash-secured if the writer 
segregates cash, high-grade short-term debt obligations, or other permissible 
collateral equal to the exercise price. As the writer of a covered call option, 
the Fund foregoes, during the option’s life, the opportunity to profit from 
increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the 
sum of the premium and the strike price of the call, but has retained the risk 
of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. As the Fund writes 
covered calls over more of its portfolio, its ability to benefit from capital 
appreciation becomes more limited. The writer of an option has no control over 
the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation, but may terminate 
its position by entering into an offsetting option. Once an option writer has 
received an exercise notice, it cannot effect an offsetting transaction in order 
to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying 
security at the exercise price. 
When the Fund writes cash-secured 
put options, it bears the risk of loss if the value of the underlying stock 
declines below the exercise price minus the put premium. If the option is 
exercised, the Fund could incur a loss if it is required to purchase the stock 
underlying the put option at a price greater than the market price of the stock 
at the time of exercise plus the put premium the Fund received when it wrote the 
option. While the Fund’s potential gain in writing a cash-secured put option is 
limited to distributions earned on the liquid assets securing the put option 
plus the premium received from the purchaser of the put option, the Fund risks a 
loss equal to the entire exercise price of the option minus the put premium. 

Engaging in Straddles and Spreads. In a straddle 
transaction, a Fund either buys a call and a put or sells a call and a put on 
the same security. In a spread, a Fund purchases and sells a call or a put. A 
Fund will sell a straddle when the Fund’s Adviser believes the price of a 
security will be stable. The Fund will receive a premium on the sale of the put 
and the call. A spread permits a Fund to make a hedged investment that the price 
of a security will increase or decline. 
Options on Indexes. Certain Funds may purchase and 
sell options on securities indexes and other types of indexes. Options on 
indexes are similar to options on securities, except that the exercise of index 
options may be settled by cash payments (or in some instances by a futures 
contract) and does not involve the actual purchase or sale of securities or the 
instruments in the index. In addition, these options are designed to reflect 
price fluctuations in a group of securities or instruments or segment of the 
securities’ or instruments’ market rather than price fluctuations in a single 
security or instrument. A Fund, in purchasing or selling index options, is 
subject to the risk that the value of its portfolio may not change as much as an 
index because a Fund’s investments generally will not match the composition of 
an index. Unlike call options on securities, index options are cash settled, or 
settled with a futures contract in some instances, rather than settled by 
delivery of the underlying index securities or instruments. 
Certain Funds purchase and sell 
credit options which are options on indexes of derivative instruments such as 
credit default swap indexes. Like other index options, credit options can be 
cash settled or settled with a futures contract in some instances. In addition, 
credit options can also be settled in some instances by delivery of the 
underlying index instrument. Credit options may be used for a variety of 
purposes including hedging, risk management such as positioning a portfolio for 
anticipated volatility or increasing income or gain to a Fund. There is no 
guarantee that the strategy of using options on indexes or credit options in 
particular will be successful. 
For a number of reasons, a liquid 
market may not exist and thus a Fund may not be able to close out an option 
position that it has previously entered into. When a Fund purchases an OTC 
option (as defined below), it will be relying on its counterparty to perform its 
obligations and the Fund may incur additional losses if the counterparty is 
unable to perform. 
Exchange-Traded and OTC Options. All options 
purchased or sold by a Fund will be traded on a securities exchange or will be 
purchased or sold by securities dealers (“OTC options”) that meet the Fund’s 
creditworthiness standards. While exchange-traded options are obligations of the 
Options Clearing Corporation, in the case of OTC options, a Fund relies on the 
dealer from which it purchased the option to perform if the option is exercised. 
Thus, when a Fund purchases an OTC option, it relies on the dealer from which it 
purchased the option to make or take delivery of the underlying securities. 
Failure by the dealer to do so would result in the loss of the premium paid by a 
Fund as well as loss of the expected benefit of the transaction. 
Provided that a Fund has 
arrangements with certain qualified dealers who agree that a Fund may repurchase 
any option it writes for a maximum price to be calculated by a predetermined 
formula, a Fund may treat the underlying securities used to cover written OTC 
options as liquid. In these cases, the OTC option itself would only 
 
Part II - 41 


be considered illiquid to the extent 
that the maximum repurchase price under the formula exceeds the intrinsic value 
of the option. 
Futures Contracts. When a Fund purchases a 
futures contract, it agrees to purchase a specified quantity of an underlying 
instrument at a specified future date or, in the case of an index futures 
contract, to make a cash payment based on the value of a securities index. When 
a Fund sells a futures contract, it agrees to sell a specified quantity of the 
underlying instrument at a specified future date or, in the case of an index 
futures contract, to receive a cash payment based on the value of a securities 
index. The price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when a 
Fund enters into the contract. Futures can be held until their delivery dates or 
the position can be (and normally is) closed out before then. There is no 
assurance, however, that a liquid market will exist when the Fund wishes to 
close out a particular position. 
When a Fund purchases a futures 
contract, the value of the futures contract tends to increase and decrease in 
tandem with the value of its underlying instrument. Therefore, purchasing 
futures contracts will tend to increase a Fund’s exposure to positive and 
negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument, much as if it had 
purchased the underlying instrument directly. When a Fund sells a futures 
contract, by contrast, the value of its futures position will tend to move in a 
direction contrary to the value of the underlying instrument. Selling futures 
contracts, therefore, will tend to offset both positive and negative market 
price changes, much as if the underlying instrument had been sold. 
The purchaser or seller of a futures 
contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless 
the contract is held until the delivery date. However, when a Fund buys or sells 
a futures contract it will be required to deposit “initial margin” with a 
futures commission merchant (“FCM”). Initial margin deposits are typically equal 
to a small percentage of the contract’s value. If the value of either party’s 
position declines, that party will be required to make additional “variation 
margin” payments equal to the change in value on a daily basis. The party that 
has a gain may be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount. A Fund 
may be obligated to make payments of variation margin at a time when it is 
disadvantageous to do so. Furthermore, it may not always be possible for a Fund 
to close out its futures positions. Until it closes out a futures position, a 
Fund will be obligated to continue to pay variation margin. Initial and 
variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing on margin for purposes of 
a Fund’s investment restrictions. In the event of the bankruptcy of an FCM that 
holds margin on behalf of a Fund, the Fund may be entitled to return of margin 
owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the FCM’s other 
customers, potentially resulting in losses to the Fund. For cash-settled 
futures, the Fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets in an amount equal to 
the mark-to-market value. For physically settled futures, the Fund will earmark 
or segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to the notional value. In 
calculating the segregation amount, netting of similar contracts is generally 
permitted. Such assets cannot be sold while the futures contract or option is 
outstanding unless they are replaced with other suitable assets. By setting 
aside assets equal only to its net obligation under cash-settled futures, a Fund 
will have the ability to have exposure to such instruments to a greater extent 
than if a Fund were required to set aside assets equal to the full notional 
value of such contracts. There is a possibility that earmarking and reservation 
of a large percentage of a Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or a 
Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. 

The Funds only invest in futures 
contracts on securities to the extent they could invest in the underlying 
securities directly. Certain Funds may also invest in index futures where the 
underlying securities or instruments are not available for direct investments by 
the Funds. 
Cash 
Equitization. The objective where equity futures are used to “equitize” cash 
is to match the notional value of all futures contracts to a Fund’s cash 
balance. The notional values of the futures contracts and of the cash are 
monitored daily. As the cash is invested in securities and/or paid out to 
participants in redemptions, the Adviser simultaneously adjusts the futures 
positions. Through such procedures, a Fund not only gains equity exposure from 
the use of futures, but also benefits from increased flexibility in responding 
to client cash flow needs. Additionally, because it can be less expensive to 
trade a list of securities as a package or program trade rather than as a group 
of individual orders, futures provide a means through which transaction costs 
can be reduced. Such non-hedging risk 
management techniques involve leverage, and thus present, as do all leveraged 
transactions, the possibility of losses as well as gains that are greater than 
if these techniques involved the purchase and sale of the securities themselves 
rather than their synthetic derivatives. 
Options on Futures Contracts. Futures contracts 
obligate the buyer to take and the seller to make delivery at a future date of a 
specified quantity of a financial instrument or an amount of cash based on the 
value of a securities or other index. Currently, futures contracts are available 
on various types of securities, including but not limited to U.S. Treasury 
bonds, notes and bills, Eurodollar certificates of deposit and on indexes of 
securities. Unlike a futures 
 
Part II - 42 


contract, which requires the parties 
to buy and sell a security or make a cash settlement payment based on changes in 
a financial instrument or securities or other index on an agreed date, an option 
on a futures contract entitles its holder to decide on or before a future date 
whether to enter into such a contract. If the holder decides not to exercise its 
option, the holder may close out the option position by entering into an 
offsetting transaction or may decide to let the option expire and forfeit the 
premium thereon. The purchaser of an option on a futures contract pays a premium 
for the option but makes no initial margin payments or daily payments of cash in 
the nature of “variation margin” payments to reflect the change in the value of 
the underlying contract as does a purchaser or seller of a futures contract. 

The seller of an option on a futures 
contract receives the premium paid by the purchaser and may be required to pay 
initial margin. For physically settled options on futures, the Funds will 
earmark or segregate an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of 
the underlying future. For cash-settled options on futures, the Fund will 
earmark or segregate an amount of liquid assets equal to the market value of the 
obligation. Market value is equal to the intrinsic value, which is calculated by 
taking the number of contracts times a multiplier times the difference between 
the strike and current market price. 
Combined Positions. Certain Funds may purchase and 
write options in combination with futures or forward contracts, to adjust the 
risk and return characteristics of the overall position. For example, a Fund may 
purchase a put option and write a call option on the same underlying instrument, 
in order to construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics 
are similar to selling a futures contract. Another possible combined position 
would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option 
at a lower price, in order to reduce the risk of the written call option in the 
event of a substantial price increase. Because combined options positions 
involve multiple trades, they result in higher transaction costs and may be more 
difficult to open and close out. 
Correlation of Price Changes. Because there are a 
limited number of types of exchange-traded options and futures contracts, it is 
likely that the standardized options and futures contracts available will not 
match a Fund’s current or anticipated investments exactly. A Fund may invest in 
futures and options contracts based on securities or instruments with different 
issuers, maturities, or other characteristics from the securities in which it 
typically invests, which involves a risk that the options or futures position 
will not track the performance of a Fund’s other investments. 
Options and futures contracts prices 
can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments, even if the 
underlying instruments match the Fund’s investments well. Options and futures 
contracts prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated short 
term interest rates, changes in volatility of the underlying instrument, and the 
time remaining until expiration of the contract, which may not affect security 
prices the same way. Imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels 
of demand in the options and futures markets and the securities markets, from 
structural differences in how options and futures and securities are traded, or 
from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts. A Fund may 
purchase or sell options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value 
than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to 
attempt to compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the 
securities, although this may not be successful in all cases. If price changes 
in a Fund’s options or futures positions are poorly correlated with its other 
investments, the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in 
losses that are not offset by gains in other investments. 
Liquidity of Options and Futures Contracts. There 
is no assurance that a liquid market will exist for any particular option or 
futures contract at any particular time even if the contract is traded on an 
exchange. In addition, exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits 
for options and futures contracts and may halt trading if a contract’s price 
moves up or down more than the limit in a given day. On volatile trading days 
when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed, it may 
be impossible for a Fund to enter into new positions or close out existing 
positions. If the market for a contract is not liquid because of price 
fluctuation limits or otherwise, it could prevent prompt liquidation of 
unfavorable positions, and could potentially require a Fund to continue to hold 
a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value. As a 
result, a Fund’s access to other assets held to cover its options or futures 
positions could also be impaired. (See “Exchange-Traded and OTC Options” above 
for a discussion of the liquidity of options not traded on an exchange.) 

Foreign Investment Risk. Certain Funds may buy 
and sell options on interest rate futures including global interest rate futures 
in which the reference interest rate is tied to currencies other than the U.S. 
dollar. Such investments are subject to additional risks including the risks 
associated with foreign investment and currency risk. See “Foreign Investments 
(including Foreign Currencies)” in this SAI Part II. 
Position Limits. Futures exchanges can limit the 
number of futures and options on futures contracts that can be held or 
controlled by an entity. If an adequate exemption cannot be obtained, a Fund or 
the Fund’s Adviser may be 
 
Part II - 43 


required to reduce the size of its 
futures and options positions or may not be able to trade a certain futures or 
options contract in order to avoid exceeding such limits. 
Asset 
Coverage for Futures Contracts and Options Positions. A Fund will comply 
with guidelines established by the SEC with respect to coverage of options and 
futures contracts by mutual funds, and if the guidelines so require, will set 
aside or earmark appropriate liquid assets in the amount prescribed. Such assets 
cannot be sold while the futures contract or option is outstanding, unless they 
are replaced with other suitable assets. As a result, there is a possibility 
that the reservation of a large percentage of a Fund’s assets could impede 
portfolio management or a Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other 
current obligations. 
Real 
Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”) 
Certain of the Funds may invest in 
equity interests or debt obligations issued by REITs. REITs are pooled 
investment vehicles which invest primarily in income producing real estate or 
real estate related loans or interest. REITs are generally classified as equity 
REITs, mortgage REITs or a combination of equity and mortgage REITs. Equity 
REITs invest the majority of their assets directly in real property and derive 
income primarily from the collection of rents. Equity REITs can also realize 
capital gains by selling property that has appreciated in value. Mortgage REITs 
invest the majority of their assets in real estate mortgages and derive income 
from the collection of interest payments. Similar to investment companies, REITs 
are not taxed on income distributed to shareholders provided they comply with 
several requirements of the Code. A Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate 
share of expenses incurred by REITs in which a Fund invests in addition to the 
expenses incurred directly by a Fund. 
Investing in REITs involves certain 
unique risks in addition to those risks associated with investing in the real 
estate industry in general. Equity REITs may be affected by changes in the value 
of the underlying property owned by the REITs, while mortgage REITs may be 
affected by the quality of any credit extended. REITs are dependent upon 
management skills and on cash flows, are not diversified, and are subject to 
default by borrowers and self-liquidation. REITs are also subject to the 
possibilities of failing to qualify for tax free pass-through of income under 
the Code and failing to maintain their exemption from registration under the 
1940 Act. 
REITs (especially mortgage REITs) 
are also subject to interest rate risks. When interest rates decline, the value 
of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. 
Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed 
rate obligations can be expected to decline. In contrast, as interest rates on 
adjustable rate mortgage loans are reset periodically, yields on a REIT’s 
investment in such loans will gradually align themselves to fluctuate less 
dramatically in response to interest rate fluctuations than would investments in 
fixed rate obligations. 
Investment in REITs involves risks 
similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. 
These risks include: 
 



 
•
 

limited 
      financial resources; 
 



 
•
 

infrequent 
      or limited trading; and 
 



 
•
 

more 
      abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. 
      
In addition, small capitalization 
stocks, such as certain REITs, historically have been more volatile in price 
than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S&P 500 Index. 

Recent Events Relating to the Overall Economy 

The U.S. Government, the Federal 
Reserve, the Treasury, the SEC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken actions to address the 
financial crisis. These actions included, in part, the enactment by the United 
States Congress of the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act”, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010 and imposed a new 
regulatory framework over the U.S. financial services industry and the consumer 
credit markets in general, and proposed and final regulations by the SEC. Given 
the broad scope, sweeping nature, and relatively recent enactment of some of 
these regulatory measures, the potential impact they could have on securities 
held by the Funds is unknown. There can be no assurance that these measures will 
not have an adverse effect on the value or marketability of securities held by 
the Funds. Furthermore, no assurance can be made that the U.S. Government or any 
U.S. regulatory body (or other authority or regulatory body) will not continue 
to take further legislative or regulatory action, and the effect of such 
actions, if taken, cannot be known. 
 
Part II - 44 


Repurchase Agreements 
Repurchase agreements may be entered 
into with brokers, dealers or banks or other entities that meet the Adviser’s 
credit guidelines. A Fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with member 
banks of the Federal Reserve System and securities dealers or other entities 
believed by the Adviser to be creditworthy. The Adviser may consider the 
collateral received and any applicable guarantees in making its determination. 
In a repurchase agreement, a Fund buys a security from a seller that has agreed 
to repurchase the same security at a mutually agreed upon date and price. The 
resale price normally is in excess of the purchase price, reflecting an agreed 
upon interest rate. This interest rate is effective for the period of time a 
Fund is invested in the agreement and is not related to the coupon rate on the 
underlying security. A repurchase agreement may also be viewed as a fully 
collateralized loan of money by a Fund to the seller. The maximum maturity 
permitted for a non-“putable” repurchase agreement will be (i) 95 days for a 
Money Market Fund for certain counterparties and 45 days for others and (ii) 190 
days for any Fund that is not a Money Market Fund. The maximum notice period 
permitted for a “putable” repurchase agreement (i.e., where the Fund has a right 
to put the repurchase agreement to the counterparty at par plus accrued interest 
at a specified notice period) will be (i) 95 days for a Money Market Fund for 
certain counterparties and 45 days for others and (ii) 190 days for any Fund 
that is not a Money Market Fund. The securities which are subject to repurchase 
agreements, however, may have maturity dates in excess of 190 days from the 
effective date of the repurchase agreement. In addition, the maturity of a 
“putable” repurchase agreement may be in excess of 190 days. Repurchase 
agreements maturing in more than seven days (or where the put right requires 
greater than seven days’ notice) are treated as illiquid for purposes of a 
Fund’s restrictions on purchases of illiquid securities. A Fund will always 
receive securities as collateral during the term of the agreement whose market 
value is at least equal to 100% of the dollar amount invested by the Fund in 
each agreement plus accrued interest. The repurchase agreements further 
authorize the Fund to demand additional collateral in the event that the dollar 
value of the collateral falls below 100%. A Fund will make payment for such 
securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of book entry transfer 
to the account of the custodian. Repurchase agreements are considered under the 
1940 Act to be loans collateralized by the underlying securities. 
All of the Funds that are permitted 
to invest in repurchase agreements may engage in repurchase agreement 
transactions that are collateralized fully as defined in Rule 5b-3(c)(1) of the 
1940 Act (except that Rule 5b-3(c)(1)(iv)(C) under the 1940 Act shall not apply 
for the Money Market Funds), which has the effect of enabling a Fund to look to 
the collateral, rather than the counterparty, for determining whether its assets 
are “diversified” for 1940 Act purposes. With respect to the Money Market Funds, 
in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act, the Adviser evaluates the 
creditworthiness of each counterparty. The Adviser may consider the collateral 
received and any applicable guarantees in making its determination. Certain 
Funds may, in addition, engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are 
collateralized by money market instruments, debt securities, loan 
participations, equity securities or other securities including securities that 
are rated below investment grade by the requisite NRSROs or unrated securities 
of comparable quality. For these types of repurchase agreement transactions, the 
Fund would look to the counterparty, and not the collateral, for determining 
such diversification. 
A repurchase agreement is subject to 
the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the security. In the event of 
default by the seller under a repurchase agreement construed to be a 
collateralized loan, the underlying securities would not be owned by the Fund, 
but would only constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the 
repurchase price. Therefore, a Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs in 
connection with the disposition of the collateral. The collateral underlying 
repurchase agreements may be more susceptible to claims of the seller’s 
creditors than would be the case with securities owned by the Fund. 
Under existing guidance from the 
SEC, certain Funds may transfer uninvested cash balances into a joint account, 
along with cash of other Funds and certain other accounts. These balances may be 
invested in one or more repurchase agreements and/or short-term money market 
instruments. 
Reverse Repurchase Agreements 
In a reverse repurchase agreement, a 
Fund sells a security and agrees to repurchase the same security at a mutually 
agreed upon date and price reflecting the interest rate effective for the term 
of the agreement. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a reverse repurchase agreement 
is considered borrowing by a Fund and, therefore, a form of leverage. Leverage 
may cause any gains or losses for a Fund to be magnified. The Funds will invest 
the proceeds of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements. In addition, 
except for liquidity purposes, a Fund will enter into a reverse repurchase 
agreement only when the expected return from the investment of the proceeds is 
greater than the 
 
Part II - 45 


expense of the transaction. A Fund 
will not invest the proceeds of a reverse repurchase agreement for a period 
which exceeds the duration of the reverse repurchase agreement. A Fund would be 
required to pay interest on amounts obtained through reverse repurchase 
agreements, which are considered borrowings under federal securities laws. The 
repurchase price is generally equal to the original sales price plus interest. 
Reverse repurchase agreements are usually for seven days or less and cannot be 
repaid prior to their expiration dates. Each Fund will earmark and reserve Fund 
assets, in cash or liquid securities, in an amount at least equal to its 
purchase obligations under its reverse repurchase agreements. Reverse repurchase 
agreements involve the risk that the market value of the portfolio securities 
transferred may decline below the price at which a Fund is obliged to purchase 
the securities. All forms of borrowing (including reverse repurchase agreements) 
are limited in the aggregate and may not exceed 33 1/3% of a Fund’s total assets, except 
as permitted by law. 
Securities Lending 
To generate additional income, 
certain Funds may lend up to 33 1/3% of such Fund’s total assets 
pursuant to agreements requiring that the loan be continuously secured by 
collateral equal to at least 100% of the market value plus accrued interest on 
the securities lent. Certain Funds (generally some of the Funds with an 
investment strategy of investing primarily in U.S. equity securities) use 
Goldman Sachs Bank USA (formerly known as The Goldman Sachs Trust Company), 
doing business as Goldman Sachs Agency Lending (“Goldman Sachs”), as their 
securities lending agent. Pursuant to an agreement among Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank and certain Funds (the “Third Party Securities Lending Agreement”), 
approved by the Board of Trustees, Goldman Sachs compensates JPMorgan Chase Bank 
for certain operational services, which may include processing transactions, 
termination of loans and recordkeeping, provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank. The 
other Funds that engage in securities lending use JPMorgan Chase Bank as their 
securities lending agent. 
Pursuant to a securities lending 
agreement approved by the Board of Trustees between Goldman Sachs and the Trusts 
on behalf of certain J.P. Morgan U.S. equity funds (the “Goldman Sachs 
Agreement”), collateral for loans will consist only of cash. Pursuant to a 
securities lending agreement approved by the Board of Trustees between JPMorgan 
Chase Bank and certain Funds (the “JPMorgan Agreement”), collateral for loans 
will consist of cash. The Funds receive payments from the borrowers equivalent 
to the dividends and interest that would have been earned on the securities 
lent. For loans secured by cash, the Funds seek to earn interest on the 
investment of cash collateral in investments permitted by the applicable 
securities lending agreement. Under both the Goldman Sachs Agreement and the 
JPMorgan Agreement, cash collateral may be invested in Capital Shares of the 
Prime Money Market Fund. 
Under the JPMorgan Agreement, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank performs a daily mark to market of the loaned security and 
requests additional cash collateral if the amount of cash received from the 
borrower is less than 102% of the value of the loaned security in the case of 
securities denominated in U.S. dollars and 105% of the value of the loaned 
security in the case of securities denominated in non-U.S. dollars subject to certain de
minimis guidelines. Such de minimis guidelines provide that for a loan of 
U.S. dollar denominated securities, the aggregate value of cash collateral for 
such loan may be less than 102% but in no event less than 101.51% and for a loan 
of non-U.S. dollar denominated 
securities, the aggregate value of cash collateral held for such loan may be 
less than 105% but in no event less than 104.51%. Under the Goldman Sachs 
Agreement, Goldman Sachs marks to market the loaned securities on a daily basis. 
In the event the cash received from the borrower is less than 102% of the value 
of the loaned securities, Goldman Sachs requests additional cash from the 
borrower so as to maintain a collateralization level of at least 102% of the 
value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. Loans are subject to 
termination by a Fund or the borrower at any time, and are therefore not 
considered to be illiquid investments. A Fund does not have the right to vote 
proxies for securities on loan. However, a Fund’s Adviser may terminate a loan 
if the vote is considered material with respect to an investment. 
Securities lending involves 
counterparty risk, including the risk that the loaned securities may not be 
returned or returned in a timely manner and/or a loss of rights in the 
collateral if the borrower or the lending agent defaults or fails financially. 
This risk is increased when a Fund’s loans are concentrated with a single or 
limited number of borrowers. The earnings on the collateral invested may not be 
sufficient to pay fees incurred in connection with the loan. Also, the principal 
value of the collateral invested may decline and may not be sufficient to pay 
back the borrower for the amount of collateral posted. There are no limits on 
the number of borrowers a Fund may use and a Fund may lend securities to only 
one or a small group of borrowers. In addition, under the Goldman Sachs 
Agreement, loans may be made to affiliates of Goldman Sachs as identified in the 
Goldman Sachs Agreement. Funds participating in securities lending bear the risk 
of loss in connection with investments of the cash collateral received from the 
borrowers, which do not trigger additional collateral requirements from the 
borrower. 
 
Part II - 46 


To the extent that the value or 
return of a Fund’s investments of the cash collateral declines below the amount 
owed to a borrower, the Fund may incur losses that exceed the amount it earned 
on lending the security. In situations where the Adviser does not believe that 
it is prudent to sell the cash collateral investments in the market, a Fund may 
borrow money to repay the borrower the amount of cash collateral owed to the 
borrower upon return of the loaned securities. This will result in financial 
leverage, which may cause the Fund to be more volatile because financial 
leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value 
of the Fund’s portfolio securities. 
Short 
Selling 
In short selling transactions, a 
Fund sells a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline in the market 
value of the security. To complete the transaction, a Fund must borrow the 
security to make delivery to the buyer. A Fund is obligated to replace the 
security borrowed by purchasing it subsequently at the market price at the time 
of replacement. The price at such time may be more or less than the price at 
which the security was sold by a Fund, which may result in a loss or gain, 
respectively. Unlike taking a long position in a security by purchasing the 
security, where potential losses are limited to the purchase price, short sales 
have no cap on maximum losses, and gains are limited to the price of the 
security at the time of the short sale. 
Short sales of forward commitments 
and derivatives do not involve borrowing a security. These types of short sales 
may include futures, options, contracts for differences, forward contracts on 
financial instruments and options such as contracts, credit linked instruments, 
and swap contracts. 
A Fund may not always be able to 
borrow a security it wants to sell short. A Fund also may be unable to close out 
an established short position at an acceptable price and may have to sell long 
positions at disadvantageous times to cover its short positions. The value of 
your investment in a Fund will fluctuate in response to movements in the market. 
Fund performance also will depend on the effectiveness of the Adviser’s research 
and the management team’s investment decisions. The SEC and financial industry 
regulatory authorities in other countries may impose prohibitions, restrictions 
or other regulatory requirements on short sales, which could inhibit the ability 
of the Adviser to sell securities short on behalf of the Fund. For example, in 
September 2008, in response to spreading turmoil in the financial markets, the 
SEC temporarily banned short selling in the stocks of numerous financial 
services companies, and also promulgated new disclosure requirements with 
respect to short positions held by investment managers. The SEC’s temporary ban 
on short selling of such stocks has since expired, but should similar 
restrictions and/or additional disclosure requirements be promulgated, 
especially if market turmoil occurs, a Fund may be forced to cover short 
positions more quickly than otherwise intended and may suffer losses as a 
result. Such restrictions may also adversely affect the ability of a Fund 
(especially if a Fund utilizes short selling as a significant portion of its 
investment strategy) to execute its investment strategies generally. 
Short sales also involve other 
costs. A Fund must repay to the lender an amount equal to any dividends or 
interest that accrues while the loan is outstanding. To borrow the security, a 
Fund may be required to pay a premium. A Fund also will incur transaction costs 
in effecting short sales. The amount of any ultimate gain for a Fund resulting 
from a short sale will be decreased and the amount of any ultimate loss will be 
increased by the amount of premiums, interest or expenses a Fund may be required 
to pay in connection with the short sale. Until a Fund closes the short 
position, it will earmark and reserve Fund assets, in cash or liquid securities, 
to offset a portion of the leverage risk. Realized gains from short sales are 
typically treated as short-term gains/losses. 
Certain of a Fund’s service 
providers may have agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses to limit the 
Fund’s operating expenses in the amount and for the time period specified in the 
Fund’s prospectuses. The expense limitation does not include certain expenses 
including, to the extent indicated in the Fund’s prospectuses, dividend and 
interest expense on short sales. In calculating the interest expense on short 
sales for purposes of this exclusion, the Fund will recognize all economic 
elements of interest costs, including premium and discount adjustments. 

Short-Term Funding Agreements 
Short-term funding agreements issued 
by insurance companies are sometimes referred to as Guaranteed Investment 
Contracts (“GICs”), while those issued by banks are referred to as Bank 
Investment Contracts (“BICs”). Pursuant to such agreements, a Fund makes cash 
contributions to a deposit account at a bank or insurance company. The bank or 
insurance company then credits to the Fund on a monthly basis guaranteed 
interest at either a fixed, variable or floating rate. These contracts are 
general obligations of the issuing bank or insurance company (although they may 
be the obligations of an insurance company separate account) and are paid from 
the general assets of the issuing entity. 
 
Part II - 47 


A Fund will purchase short-term 
funding agreements only from banks and insurance companies which, at the time of 
purchase, are rated in one of the three highest rating categories and have 
assets of $1 billion or more. Generally, there is no active secondary market in 
short-term funding agreements. Therefore, short-term funding agreements may be 
considered by a Fund to be illiquid investments. To the extent that a short-term 
funding agreement is determined to be illiquid, such agreements will be acquired 
by a Fund only if, at the time of purchase, no more than 15% of the Fund’s net 
assets (5% of the total assets for the Money Market Funds) will be invested in 
short-term funding agreements and other illiquid securities. 
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies 

The Funds may invest in stock, 
warrants, and other securities of special purpose acquisition companies 
(“SPACs”) or similar special purpose entities that pool funds to seek potential 
acquisition opportunities. Unless and until an acquisition is completed, a SPAC 
generally invests its assets (less a portion retained to cover expenses) in U.S. 
Government securities, money market fund securities and cash. To the extent the 
SPAC is invested in cash or similar securities, this may impact a Fund’s ability 
to meet its investment objective. If an acquisition that meets the requirements 
for the SPAC is not completed within a pre-established period of time, the 
invested funds are returned to the entity’s shareholders, less certain permitted 
expense, and any warrants issued by the SPAC will expire worthless. Because 
SPACs and similar entities are in essence blank check companies without an 
operating history or ongoing business other than seeking acquisitions, the value 
of their securities is particularly dependent on the ability of the entity’s 
management to identify and complete a profitable acquisition. SPACs may pursue 
acquisitions only within certain industries or regions, which may increase the 
volatility of their prices. In addition, these securities, which are typically 
traded in the over-the-counter market, may be considered illiquid and/or be 
subject to restrictions on resale. 
Structured Investments 
A structured investment is a 
security having a return tied to an underlying index or other security or asset 
class. Structured investments generally are individually negotiated agreements 
and may be traded over-the-counter. Structured 
investments are organized and operated to restructure the investment 
characteristics of the underlying security. This restructuring involves the 
deposit with or purchase by an entity, such as a corporation or trust, or 
specified instruments (such as commercial bank loans) and the issuance by that 
entity or one or more classes of securities (“structured securities”) backed by, 
or representing interests in, the underlying instruments. The cash flow on the 
underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured 
securities to create securities with different investment characteristics, such 
as varying maturities, payment priorities and interest rate provisions, and the 
extent of such payments made with respect to structured securities is dependent 
on the extent of the cash flow on the underlying instruments. Because structured 
securities typically involve no credit enhancement, their credit risk generally 
will be equivalent to that of the underlying instruments. Investments in 
structured securities are generally of a class of structured securities that is 
either subordinated or unsubordinated to the right of payment of another class. 
Subordinated structured securities typically have higher yields and present 
greater risks than unsubordinated structured securities. Structured instruments 
include structured notes. In addition to the risks applicable to investments in 
structured investments and debt securities in general, structured notes bear the 
risk that the issuer may not be required to pay interest on the structured note 
if the index rate rises above or falls below a certain level. Structured 
securities are typically sold in private placement transactions, and there 
currently is no active trading market for structured securities. Investments in 
government and government-related restructured debt instruments are subject to 
special risks, including the inability or unwillingness to repay principal and 
interest, requests to reschedule or restructure outstanding debt and requests to 
extend additional loan amounts. Structured investments include a wide variety of 
instruments including, without limitation, Collateralized Debt Obligations, 
credit linked notes, and participation notes and participatory notes. 

Structured instruments that are 
registered under the federal securities laws may be treated as liquid. In 
addition, many structured instruments may not be registered under the federal 
securities laws. In that event, a Fund’s ability to resell such a structured 
instrument may be more limited than its ability to resell other Fund securities. 
The Funds will treat such instruments as illiquid and will limit their 
investments in such instruments to no more than 15% of each Fund’s net assets 
(5% of the total assets for the Money Market Funds), when combined with all 
other illiquid investments of each Fund. 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 
set forth in the fee table and Financial Highlights section of each Fund’s 
Prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain 
structured or synthetic 
 
Part II - 48 


products that may rely on the 
exception for the definition of “investment company” provided by section 3(c)(1) 
or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. 
Credit Linked Notes. Certain Funds may invest in 
structured instruments known as credit linked securities or credit linked notes 
(“CLNs”). CLNs are typically issued by a limited purpose trust or other vehicle 
(the “CLN trust”) that, in turn, invests in a derivative or basket of 
derivatives instruments, such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps 
and/or other securities, in order to provide exposure to certain high yield, 
sovereign debt, emerging markets, or other fixed income markets. Generally, 
investments in CLNs represent the right to receive periodic income payments (in 
the form of distributions) and payment of principal at the end of the term of 
the CLN. However, these payments are conditioned on the CLN trust’s receipt of 
payments from, and the CLN trust’s potential obligations, to the counterparties 
to the derivative instruments and other securities in which the CLN trust 
invests. For example, the CLN trust may sell one or more credit default swaps, 
under which the CLN trust would receive a stream of payments over the term of 
the swap agreements provided that no event of default has occurred with respect 
to the referenced debt obligation upon which the swap is based. If a default 
were to occur, the stream of payments may stop and the CLN trust would be 
obligated to pay the counterparty the par (or other agreed upon value) of the 
referenced debt obligation. This, in turn, would reduce the amount of income and 
principal that a Fund would receive as an investor in the CLN trust. 
Certain Funds may enter into CLNs 
structured as “First-to-Default” CLNs. In a First-to-Default CLN, the CLN trust 
enters into a credit default swap on a portfolio of a specified number of 
individual securities pursuant to which the CLN trust sells protection to a 
counterparty. The CLN trust uses the proceeds of issuing investments in the CLN 
trust to purchase securities, which are selected by the counterparty and the 
total return of which is paid to the counterparty. Upon the occurrence of a 
default or credit event involving any one of the individual securities, the 
credit default swaps terminate and the Fund’s investment in the CLN trust is 
redeemed for an amount equal to “par” minus the amount paid to the counterparty 
under the credit default swap. 
Certain Funds may also enter in CLNs 
to gain access to sovereign debt and securities in emerging market particularly 
in markets where the Fund is not able to purchase securities directly due to 
domicile restrictions or tax restrictions or tariffs. In such an instance, the 
issuer of the CLN may purchase the reference security directly and/or gain 
exposure through a credit default swap or other derivative. 
A Fund’s investments in CLNs is 
subject to the risks associated with the underlying reference obligations and 
derivative instruments, including, among others, credit risk, default or similar 
event risk, counterparty risk, interest rate risk, leverage risk and management 
risk. 
Participation Notes and Participatory Notes. 
Certain Funds may invest in instruments that have similar economic 
characteristics to equity securities, such as participation notes (also known as 
participatory notes (“P-notes”)) or 
other structured instruments that may be developed from time to time 
(“structured instruments”). Structured instruments are notes that are issued by 
banks, broker-dealers or their affiliates and are designed to offer a return 
linked to a particular underlying equity or market. 
If the structured instrument were 
held to maturity, the issuer would pay to the purchaser the underlying 
instrument’s value at maturity with any necessary adjustments. The holder of a 
structured instrument that is linked to a particular underlying security or 
instrument may be entitled to receive dividends paid in connection with that 
underlying security or instrument, but typically does not receive voting rights 
as it would if it directly owned the underlying security or instrument. 
Structured instruments have transaction costs. In addition, there can be no 
assurance that there will be a trading market for a structured instrument or 
that the trading price of a structured instrument will equal the underlying 
value of the security, instrument or market that it seeks to replicate. Unlike a 
direct investment in equity securities, structured instruments typically involve 
a term or expiration date, potentially increasing the Fund’s turnover rate, 
transaction costs and tax liability. 
Due to transfer restrictions, the 
secondary markets on which a structured instrument is traded may be less liquid 
than the market for other securities, or may be completely illiquid, which may 
expose the Fund to risks of mispricing or improper valuation. Structured 
instruments typically constitute general unsecured contractual obligations of 
the banks, broker-dealers or their relevant affiliates that issue them, which 
subjects the Fund to counterparty risk (and this risk may be amplified if the 
Fund purchases structured instruments from only a small number of issuers). 
Structured instruments also have the same risks associated with a direct 
investment in the underlying securities, instruments or markets that they seek 
to replicate.

Swaps 
and Related Swap Products 
Swap transactions may include, but 
are not limited to, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, cross-currency interest 
rate swaps, forward rate agreements, contracts for differences, total return 
swaps, index swaps, basket swaps, specific security swaps, fixed income sectors 
swaps, commodity swaps, asset-backed swaps (ABX), commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (CMBS) and indexes of CMBS (CMBX), credit default swaps, interest 
rate caps, price lock swaps, floors and collars and swaptions (collectively 
defined as “swap transactions”). 
A Fund may enter into swap 
transactions for any legal purpose consistent with its investment objective and 
policies, such as for the purpose of attempting to obtain or preserve a 
particular return or spread at a lower cost than obtaining that return or spread 
through purchases and/or sales of instruments in cash markets, to protect 
against currency fluctuations, to protect against any increase in the price of 
securities a Fund anticipates purchasing at a later date, or to gain exposure to 
certain markets in the most economical way possible. 
Swap agreements are two-party contracts entered into primarily by 
institutional counterparties for periods ranging from a few weeks to several 
years. In a standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns 
(or differentials in rates of return) that would be earned or realized on 
specified notional investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged 
or “swapped” between the parties are calculated by reference to a “notional 
amount,” i.e., the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount 
invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular foreign currency or 
commodity, or in a “basket” of securities representing a particular index. The 
purchaser of an interest rate cap or floor, upon payment of a fee, has the right 
to receive payments (and the seller of the cap or floor is obligated to make 
payments) to the extent a specified interest rate exceeds (in the case of a cap) 
or is less than (in the case of a floor) a specified level over a specified 
period of time or at specified dates. The purchaser of an interest rate collar, 
upon payment of a fee, has the right to receive payments (and the seller of the 
collar is obligated to make payments) to the extent that a specified interest 
rate falls outside an agreed upon range over a specified period of time or at 
specified dates. The purchaser of an option on an interest rate swap, also known 
as a “swaption,” upon payment of a fee (either at the time of purchase or in the 
form of higher payments or lower receipts within an interest rate swap 
transaction) has the right, but not the obligation, to initiate a new swap 
transaction of a pre-specified notional 
amount with pre-specified terms with 
the seller of the swaption as the counterparty. 
The “notional amount” of a swap 
transaction is the agreed upon basis for calculating the payments that the 
parties have agreed to exchange. For example, one swap counterparty may agree to 
pay a floating rate of interest (e.g., 3 month LIBOR) calculated based on a $10 
million notional amount on a quarterly basis in exchange for receipt of payments 
calculated based on the same notional amount and a fixed rate of interest on a 
semi-annual basis. In the event a Fund is obligated to make payments more 
frequently than it receives payments from the other party, it will incur 
incremental credit exposure to that swap counterparty. This risk may be 
mitigated somewhat by the use of swap agreements which call for a net payment to 
be made by the party with the larger payment obligation when the obligations of 
the parties fall due on the same date. Under most swap agreements entered into 
by a Fund, payments by the parties will be exchanged on a “net basis”, and a 
Fund will receive or pay, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two 
payments. 
The amount of a Fund’s potential 
gain or loss on any swap transaction is not subject to any fixed limit. Nor is 
there any fixed limit on a Fund’s potential loss if it sells a cap or collar. If 
a Fund buys a cap, floor or collar, however, the Fund’s potential loss is 
limited to the amount of the fee that it has paid. When measured against the 
initial amount of cash required to initiate the transaction, which is typically 
zero in the case of most conventional swap transactions, swaps, caps, floors and 
collars tend to be more volatile than many other types of instruments. 

The use of swap transactions, caps, 
floors and collars involves investment techniques and risks that are different 
from those associated with portfolio security transactions. If a Fund’s Adviser 
is incorrect in its forecasts of market values, interest rates, and other 
applicable factors, the investment performance of the Fund will be less 
favorable than if these techniques had not been used. These instruments are 
typically not traded on exchanges. Accordingly, there is a risk that the other 
party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to a Fund 
or that a Fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its 
exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it 
wishes to do so. Such occurrences could result in losses to a Fund. A Fund’s 
Adviser will consider such risks and will enter into swap and other derivatives 
transactions only when it believes that the risks are not unreasonable. 

A Fund will earmark and reserve Fund 
assets, in cash or liquid securities, in an amount sufficient at all times to 
cover its current obligations under its swap transactions, caps, floors and 
collars. If a Fund enters into a swap 
 
Part II - 50 


agreement on a net basis, it will 
earmark and reserve assets with a daily value at least equal to the excess, if 
any, of a Fund’s accrued obligations under the swap agreement over the accrued 
amount a Fund is entitled to receive under the agreement. If a Fund enters into 
a swap agreement on other than a net basis, or sells a cap, floor or collar, it 
will earmark and reserve assets with a daily value at least equal to the full 
amount of a Fund’s accrued obligations under the agreement. A Fund will not 
enter into any swap transaction, cap, floor, or collar, unless the counterparty 
to the transaction is deemed creditworthy by the Fund’s Adviser. If a 
counterparty defaults, a Fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the 
agreements related to the transaction. The swap markets in which many types of 
swap transactions are traded have grown substantially in recent years, with a 
large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and 
as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation. As a result, the markets 
for certain types of swaps (e.g., interest rate swaps) have become relatively 
liquid. The markets for some types of caps, floors and collars are less liquid. 

The liquidity of swap transactions, 
caps, floors and collars will be as set forth in guidelines established by a 
Fund’s Adviser and approved by the Trustees which are based on various factors, 
including: (1) the availability of dealer quotations and the estimated 
transaction volume for the instrument, (2) the number of dealers and end 
users for the instrument in the marketplace, (3) the level of market making 
by dealers in the type of instrument, (4) the nature of the instrument 
(including any right of a party to terminate it on demand) and (5) the 
nature of the marketplace for trades (including the ability to assign or offset 
a Fund’s rights and obligations relating to the instrument). Such determination 
will govern whether the instrument will be deemed within the applicable 
liquidity restriction on investments in securities that are not readily 
marketable. 
During the term of a swap, cap, 
floor or collar, changes in the value of the instrument are recognized as 
unrealized gains or losses by marking to market to reflect the market value of 
the instrument. When the instrument is terminated, a Fund will record a realized 
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the proceeds from (or cost 
of) the closing transaction and a Fund’s basis in the contract. 
The federal income tax treatment 
with respect to swap transactions, caps, floors, and collars may impose 
limitations on the extent to which a Fund may engage in such transactions. 

Credit Default Swaps. As described above, swap 
agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional 
investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year. In the 
case of a credit default swap (“CDS”), the contract gives one party (the buyer) 
the right to recoup the economic value of a decline in the value of debt 
securities of the reference issuer if the credit event (a downgrade or default) 
occurs. This value is obtained by delivering a debt security of the reference 
issuer to the party in return for a previously agreed payment from the other 
party (frequently, the par value of the debt security). CDS include credit 
default swaps, which are contracts on individual securities, and CDX, which are 
contracts on baskets or indices of securities. 
Credit default swaps may require 
initial premium (discount) payments as well as periodic payments (receipts) 
related to the interest leg of the swap or to the default of a reference 
obligation. In cases where a Fund is a seller of a CDS contract including a CDX 
contract, the Fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets equal the notional 
amount of the contract. Furthermore, a Fund will segregate or earmark liquid 
assets to cover any accrued payment obligations when it is the buyer of a CDS 
including CDX. In calculating the amount to be segregated for this purpose, the 
Fund is not considered to have an accrued payment obligation when it is the 
buyer of a CDS including a CDX when the contract is in a gain position as no 
additional amounts are owed to the counterparty. In cases where a Fund is a 
buyer of a CDS contract including a CDX contract, the Fund will segregate or 
earmark liquid assets equal to the mark-to-market value when the contract is in 
a loss position. 
If a Fund is a seller of protection 
under a CDS contract, the Fund would be required to pay the par (or other agreed 
upon) value of a referenced debt obligation to the counterparty in the event of 
a default or other credit event by the reference issuer, such as a U.S. or 
foreign corporate issuer, with respect to such debt obligations. In return, a 
Fund would receive from the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the 
term of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no 
default occurs, a Fund would keep the stream of payments and would have no 
payment obligations. As the seller, a Fund would be subject to investment 
exposure on the notional amount of the swap. 
If a Fund is a buyer of protection 
under a CDS contract, the Fund would have the right to deliver a referenced debt 
obligation and receive the par (or other agreed-upon) value of such debt 
obligation from the counterparty in the event of a default or other credit event 
(such as a downgrade in credit rating) by the reference issuer, such as a U.S. 
or foreign corporation, with respect to its debt obligations. In return, the 
Fund would pay the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term of 
the contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default 
occurs, the counterparty would keep the stream of payments and would have no 
further obligations to the Fund. 
 
Part II - 51 


The use of CDSs, like all swap 
agreements, is subject to certain risks. If a counterparty’s creditworthiness 
declines, the value of the swap would likely decline. Moreover, there is no 
guarantee that a Fund could eliminate its exposure under an outstanding swap 
agreement by entering into an offsetting swap agreement with the same or another 
party. In addition to general market risks, CDSs involve liquidity, credit and 
counterparty risks. The recent increase in corporate defaults further raises 
these liquidity and credit risks, increasing the possibility that sellers will 
not have sufficient funds to make payments. As unregulated instruments, CDSs are 
difficult to value and are therefore susceptible to liquidity and credit risks. 
Counterparty risks also stem from the lack of regulation of CDSs. Collateral 
posting requirements are individually negotiated between counterparties and 
there is no regulatory requirement concerning the amount of collateral that a 
counterparty must post to secure its obligations under a CDS. Because they are 
unregulated, there is no requirement that parties to a contract be informed in 
advance when a CDS is sold. As a result, investors may have difficulty 
identifying the party responsible for payment of their claims. 
If a counterparty’s credit becomes 
significantly impaired, multiple requests for collateral posting in a short 
period of time could increase the risk that the Fund may not receive adequate 
collateral. There is no readily available market for trading out of CDS 
contracts. In order to eliminate a position it has taken in a CDS, the Fund must 
terminate the existing CDS contract or enter into an offsetting trade. The Fund 
may only exit its obligations under a CDS contract by terminating the contract 
and paying applicable breakage fees, which could result in additional losses to 
the Fund. Furthermore, the cost of entering into an offsetting CDS position 
could cause the Fund to incur losses. 
Synthetic Variable Rate Instruments 
Synthetic variable rate instruments 
generally involve the deposit of a long-term tax exempt bond in a custody or 
trust arrangement and the creation of a mechanism to adjust the long-term 
interest rate on the bond to a variable short-term rate and a right (subject to 
certain conditions) on the part of the purchaser to tender it periodically to a 
third party at par. A Fund’s Adviser reviews the structure of synthetic variable 
rate instruments to identify credit and liquidity risks (including the 
conditions under which the right to tender the instrument would no longer be 
available) and will monitor those risks. In the event that the right to tender 
the instrument is no longer available, the risk to the Fund will be that of 
holding the long-term bond. In the case of some types of instruments credit 
enhancement is not provided, and if certain events occur, which may include 
(a) default in the payment of principal or interest on the underlying bond, 
(b) downgrading of the bond below investment grade or (c) a loss of 
the bond’s tax exempt status, then the put will terminate and the risk to the 
Fund will be that of holding a long-term bond. 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 
set forth in the fee table and Financial Highlights section of each Fund’s 
Prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain 
structured or synthetic products that may rely on the exception for the 
definition of “investment company” provided by section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 
1940 Act. 
Treasury Receipts 
A Fund may purchase interests in 
separately traded interest and principal component parts of U.S. Treasury 
obligations that are issued by banks or brokerage firms and are created by 
depositing U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. Treasury bonds into a special account at 
a custodian bank. Receipts include Treasury Receipts (“TRs”), Treasury 
Investment Growth Receipts (“TIGRs”), and Certificates of Accrual on Treasury 
Securities (“CATS”). Receipts in which an entity other than the government 
separates the interest and principal components are not considered government 
securities unless such securities are issued through the Treasury Separate 
Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (“STRIPS”) program. 

Trust 
Preferred Securities 
Certain Funds may purchase trust 
preferred securities, also known as “trust preferreds”, which are preferred 
stocks issued by a special purpose trust subsidiary backed by subordinated debt 
of the corporate parent. An issuer creates trust preferred securities by 
creating a trust and issuing debt to the trust. The trust in turn issues trust 
preferred securities. Trust preferred securities are hybrid securities with 
characteristics of both subordinated debt and preferred stock. Such 
characteristics include long maturities (typically 30 years or more), early 
redemption by the issuer, periodic fixed or variable interest payments, and 
maturities at face value. In addition, trust preferred securities issued by a 
bank holding company may allow deferral of interest payments for up to 5 years. 
Holders of trust preferred securities have limited voting rights to control the 
activities of the trust and no voting rights with respect to the parent company. 

 
Part II - 52 


U.S. 
Government Obligations 
U.S. government obligations may 
include direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, including Treasury bills, notes 
and bonds, all of which are backed as to principal and interest payments by the 
full faith and credit of the U.S., and separately traded principal and interest 
component parts of such obligations that are transferable through the Federal 
book-entry system known as STRIPS and Coupon Under Book Entry Safekeeping 
(“CUBES”). The Funds may also invest in TIPS. U.S. government obligations are 
subject to market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. 
The principal and interest 
components of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities of longer than ten 
years are eligible to be traded independently under the STRIPS program. Under 
the STRIPS program, the principal and interest components are separately issued 
by the U.S. Treasury at the request of depository financial institutions, which 
then trade the component parts separately. The interest component of STRIPS may 
be more volatile than that of U.S. Treasury bills with comparable maturities. 

Other obligations include those 
issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, GSEs or instrumentalities. 
These obligations may or may not be backed by the “full faith and credit” of the 
U.S. Securities which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. 
include obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association, the Farmers 
Home Administration, and the Export-Import Bank. In the case of securities not 
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S., the Funds must look principally 
to the federal agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate 
repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the U.S. itself in the 
event the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitments. Securities in 
which the Funds may invest that are not backed by the full faith and credit of 
the U.S. include, but are not limited to: (i) obligations of the Tennessee 
Valley Authority, the Federal Home Loan Banks and the U.S. Postal Service, each 
of which has the right to borrow from the U.S. Treasury to meet its obligations; 
(ii) securities issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are supported 
only by the credit of such securities, but for which the Secretary of the 
Treasury has discretionary authority to purchase limited amounts of the agency’s 
obligations; and (iii) obligations of the Federal Farm Credit System and 
the Student Loan Marketing Association, each of whose obligations may be 
satisfied only by the individual credits of the issuing agency. 
The total public debt of the United 
States and other countries around the globe as a percent of gross domestic 
product has grown rapidly since the beginning of the 2008 financial downturn. 
Although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic 
problems, they may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management 
practices are not implemented. A high national debt level may increase market 
pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost higher and 
cause a country to sell additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A 
high national debt also raises concerns that a government will not be able to 
make principal or interest payments when they are due. Unsustainable debt levels 
can cause devaluations of currency, prevent a government from implementing 
effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns, and contribute 
to market volatility. 
In the past, U.S. sovereign credit 
has experienced downgrades and there can be no guarantee that it will not 
experience further downgrades in the future by rating agencies. The market 
prices and yields of securities supported by the full faith and credit of the 
U.S. Government may be adversely affected by a rating agency’s decision to 
downgrade the sovereign credit rating of the United States. 
When-Issued Securities, Delayed Delivery Securities and 
Forward Commitments 
Securities may be purchased on a 
when-issued or delayed delivery basis. For example, delivery of and payment for 
these securities can take place a month or more after the date of the purchase 
commitment. The purchase price and the interest rate payable, if any, on the 
securities are fixed on the purchase commitment date or at the time the 
settlement date is fixed. The value of such securities is subject to market 
fluctuation, and for money market instruments and other fixed income securities, 
no interest accrues to a Fund until settlement takes place. At the time a Fund 
makes the commitment to purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery 
basis, it will record the transaction, reflect the value each day of such 
securities in determining its NAV and, if applicable, calculate the maturity for 
the purposes of average maturity from that date. At the time of settlement, a 
when-issued security may be valued at less than the purchase price. To 
facilitate such acquisitions, each Fund will earmark and reserve Fund assets, in 
cash or liquid securities, in an amount at least equal to such commitments. On 
delivery dates for such transactions, each Fund will meet its obligations from 
maturities or sales of the securities earmarked and reserved for such purpose 
and/or from cash flow. If a Fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a 
when-issued security prior to its acquisition, it could, as with the disposition 
of any other portfolio obligation, incur a gain or loss due to market 
fluctuation. Also, a Fund may be disadvantaged if the other party to the 
transaction defaults. 
 
Part II - 53 


Forward Commitments. 
Securities may be purchased for delivery at a future date, which may increase 
their overall investment exposure and involves a risk of loss if the value of 
the securities declines prior to the settlement date. In order to invest a 
Fund’s assets immediately, while awaiting delivery of securities purchased on a 
forward commitment basis, short-term obligations that offer same-day settlement and earnings will 
normally be purchased. When a Fund makes a commitment to purchase a security on 
a forward commitment basis, cash or liquid securities equal to the amount of 
such Fund’s commitments will be reserved for payment of the commitment. For the 
purpose of determining the adequacy of the securities reserved for payment of 
commitments, the reserved securities will be valued at market value. If the 
market value of such securities declines, additional cash, cash equivalents or 
highly liquid securities will be reserved for payment of the commitment so that 
the value of the Fund’s assets reserved for payment of the commitments will 
equal the amount of such commitments purchased by the respective Fund. 

Purchases of securities on a forward 
commitment basis may involve more risk than other types of purchases. Securities 
purchased on a forward commitment basis and the securities held in the 
respective Fund’s portfolio are subject to changes in value based upon the 
public’s perception of the issuer and changes, real or anticipated, in the level 
of interest rates. Purchasing securities on a forward commitment basis can 
involve the risk that the yields available in the market when the delivery takes 
place may actually be higher or lower than those obtained in the transaction 
itself. On the settlement date of the forward commitment transaction, the 
respective Fund will meet its obligations from then-available cash flow, sale of 
securities reserved for payment of the commitment, sale of other securities or, 
although it would not normally expect to do so, from sale of the forward 
commitment securities themselves (which may have a value greater or lesser than 
such Fund’s payment obligations). The sale of securities to meet such 
obligations may result in the realization of capital gains or losses. Purchasing 
securities on a forward commitment basis can also involve the risk of default by 
the other party on its obligation, delaying or preventing the Fund from 
recovering the collateral or completing the transaction. 
To the extent a Fund engages in 
forward commitment transactions, it will do so for the purpose of acquiring 
securities consistent with its investment objective and policies and not for the 
purpose of investment leverage. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FUND INVESTMENT 
PRACTICES 
Investments in the Asia Pacific Region 

The economies in the Asia Pacific 
region are in all stages of economic development and may be intertwined. The 
small size of securities markets and the low trading volume in some countries in 
the Asia Pacific region may lead to a lack of liquidity. The share prices of 
companies in the region tend to be volatile and there is a significant 
possibility of loss. Many of the countries in the region are developing, both 
politically and economically, and as a result companies in the region may be 
subject to risks like nationalization or other forms of government interference, 
and/or may be heavily reliant on only a few industries or commodities. 
Investments in the region may also be subject to currency risks, such as 
restrictions on the flow of money in and out of the country, extreme volatility 
relative to the U.S. dollar, and devaluation, all of which could decrease the 
value of a Fund. 
Investments in the European Market 
Some of the Funds may invest in 
securities in the European Market. A Fund’s performance will be affected by 
political, social and economic conditions in Europe, such as growth of the 
economic output (the gross national product), the rate of inflation, the rate at 
which capital is reinvested into European economies, the success of governmental 
actions to reduce budget deficits, the resource self-sufficiency of European 
countries and interest and monetary exchange rates between European countries. 
European financial markets may experience volatility due to concerns about high 
government debt levels, credit rating downgrades, rising unemployment, the 
future of the euro as a common currency, possible restructuring of government 
debt and other government measures responding to those concerns, and fiscal and 
monetary controls imposed on member countries of the European Union. The risk of 
investing in Europe may be heightened due to the referendum in which the United 
Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. In addition, if one or more countries 
were to exit the European Union or abandon the use of the euro as a currency, 
the value of investments tied to those countries or the euro could decline 
significantly and unpredictably. 
Investments in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A Fund’s investments in municipal 
securities may be affected by political and economic developments within the 
applicable municipality and by the financial condition of the municipality. 
Certain of the issuers in which a Fund may invest have recently experienced, or 
may experience, significant financial difficulties. For example, Puerto Rico, in 
particular, has been experiencing significant financial difficulties. The 
default by issuers of Puerto Rico 
 
Part II - 54 


municipal securities on their 
obligations under securities held by a Fund may adversely affect the Fund and 
cause the Fund to lose the value of its investment in such securities. 

An insolvent municipality may take 
steps to reorganize its debt, which might include extending debt maturities, 
reducing the amount of principal or interest, refinancing the debt or taking 
other measures that may significantly affect the rights of creditors and the 
value of the securities issued by the municipality and the value of a Fund’s 
investments in those securities. Pursuant to Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code, certain municipalities that meet specific conditions may be provided 
protection from creditors while they develop and negotiate plans for 
reorganizing their debts. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that individual U.S. 
states are not permitted to pass their own laws purporting to bind 
non-consenting creditors to a restructuring of a municipality’s indebtedness, 
and thus all such restructurings must be pursuant to Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. 
Municipal bankruptcies are 
relatively rare, and certain provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing 
such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. Although Puerto Rico is a 
U.S. Territory, neither Puerto Rico nor its subdivisions or agencies are 
eligible to file under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to seek protection from 
creditors or restructure their debt. Although recent Puerto Rico legislation 
that would have allowed certain Puerto Rico public corporations to seek 
protection from creditors and to restructure their debt should they become 
insolvent has been ruled unconstitutional, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to 
review this ruling. If the U.S. Supreme Court permits municipalities or public 
corporations in Puerto Rico to restructure their outstanding obligations, it 
could have a negative impact on the marketability, liquidity or value of certain 
investments held by a Fund, which could reduce a Fund’s performance. 
Investments in the China Region 
Investing in China, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan (collectively, “the China Region”) involves a high degree of risk and 
special considerations not typically associated with investing in other more 
established economies or securities markets. Such risks may include: 
(a) the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets or confiscatory 
taxation; (b) greater social, economic and political uncertainty (including 
the risk of war); (c) dependency on exports and the corresponding 
importance of international trade; (d) the increasing competition from 
Asia’s other low-cost emerging 
economies; (e) greater price volatility and significantly smaller market 
capitalization of securities markets, particularly in China; 
(f) substantially less liquidity, particularly of certain share classes of 
Chinese securities; (g) currency exchange rate fluctuations and the lack of 
available currency hedging instruments; (h) higher rates of inflation; 
(i) controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of 
invested capital and on a Fund's ability to exchange local currencies for U.S. 
dollars; (j) greater governmental involvement in and control over the 
economy; (k) the risk that the Chinese government may decide not to 
continue to support the economic reform programs implemented since 1978 and 
could return to the prior, completely centrally planned, economy; (l) the 
fact that China region companies, particularly those located in China, may be 
smaller, less seasoned and newly-organized companies; (m) the difference 
in, or lack of, auditing and financial reporting standards which may result in 
unavailability of material information about issuers, particularly in China; 
(n) the fact that statistical information regarding the economy of China 
may be inaccurate or not comparable to statistical information regarding the 
U.S. or other economies; (o) the less extensive, and still developing, 
regulation of the securities markets, business entities and commercial 
transactions; (p) the fact that the settlement period of securities 
transactions in foreign markets may be longer; (q) the willingness and 
ability of the Chinese government to support the Chinese and Hong Kong economies 
and markets is uncertain; (r) the risk that it may be more difficult, or 
impossible, to obtain and/or enforce a judgment than in other countries; 
(s) the rapidity and erratic nature of growth, particularly in China, 
resulting in inefficiencies and dislocations; and (t) the risk that, 
because of the degree of interconnectivity between the economies and financial 
markets of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, any sizable reduction in the demand for 
goods from China, or an economic downturn in China, could negatively affect the 
economies and financial markets of Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well. 
Investment in the China Region is 
subject to certain political risks. Following the establishment of the People’s 
Republic of China by the Communist Party in 1949, the Chinese government 
renounced various debt obligations incurred by China’s predecessor governments, 
which obligations remain in default, and expropriated assets without 
compensation. There can be no assurance that the Chinese government will not 
take similar action in the future. An investment in a Fund involves risk of a 
total loss. The political reunification of China and Taiwan is a highly 
problematic issue and is unlikely to be settled in the near future. This 
situation poses a threat to Taiwan’s economy and could negatively affect its 
stock market. China has committed by treaty to preserve Hong Kong’s autonomy and 
its economic, political and social freedoms for fifty years from the 
July 1, 1997 transfer of sovereignty from Great Britain to China. However, 
if China would exert its authority so as to alter the economic, political or 
legal structures 
 
Part II - 55 


or the existing social policy of 
Hong Kong, investor and business confidence in Hong Kong could be negatively 
affected, which in turn could negatively affect markets and business 
performance. 
As with all transition economies, 
China’s ability to develop and sustain a credible legal, regulatory, monetary, 
and socioeconomic system could influence the course of outside investment. Hong 
Kong is closely tied to China, economically and through China’s 1997 acquisition 
of the country as a Special Autonomous Region (SAR). Hong Kong’s success 
depends, in large part, on its ability to retain the legal, financial, and 
monetary systems that allow economic freedom and market expansion. 
In addition to the risks inherent in 
investing in the emerging markets, the risks of investing in China, Hong Kong, 
and Taiwan merit special consideration. 
People’s Republic of China. 
The government of the People’s Republic of China is dominated by the one-party rule of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
China’s economy has transitioned 
from a rigidly central-planned state-run economy to one that has been only 
partially reformed by more market-oriented policies. Although the Chinese 
government has implemented economic reform measures, reduced state ownership of 
companies and established better corporate governance practices, a substantial 
portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the Chinese government. 
The government continues to exercise significant control over regulating 
industrial development and, ultimately, control over China’s economic growth 
through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency 
denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential 
treatment to particular industries or companies. 
Growth has also put a strain on 
China’s economy. The government has attempted to slow down the pace of growth 
through monetary tightening and administrative measures; however that policy 
started reversing in September 2008 in part due to the current global economic 
crisis, which has led to lower levels of economic growth and lower exports and 
foreign investments in the country. The Chinese government has taken 
unprecedented steps to shore up economic growth, however, the results of these 
measures are unpredictable. Over the long term the country’s major challenges 
will be dealing with its aging infrastructure, worsening environmental 
conditions and rapidly widening urban and rural income gap. 
As with all transition economies, 
China’s ability to develop and sustain a credible legal, regulatory, monetary, 
and socioeconomic system could influence the course of outside investment. The 
Chinese legal system, in particular, constitutes a significant risk factor for 
investors. The Chinese legal system is based on statutes. Over the past 25 
years, Chinese legislative bodies have promulgated laws and regulations dealing 
with various economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization 
and governance, commerce, taxation, and trade. However, these laws are 
relatively new and published court decisions based on these laws are limited and 
non-binding. The interpretation and 
enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain. 
Hong Kong. In 1997, Great 
Britain handed over control of Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland government. 
Since that time, Hong Kong has been governed by a semi-constitution known as the 
Basic Law, which guarantees a high degree of autonomy in certain matters until 
2047, while defense and foreign affairs are the responsibility of the central 
government in Beijing. The chief executive of Hong Kong is appointed by the 
Chinese government. Hong Kong is able to participate in international 
organizations and agreements and it continues to function as an international 
financial center, with no exchange controls, free convertibility of the Hong 
Kong dollar and free inward and outward movement of capital. The Basic Law 
guarantees existing freedoms, including free speech and assembly, press, 
religion, and the right to strike and travel. Business ownership, private 
property, the right of inheritance and foreign investment are also protected by 
law. China has committed by treaty to preserve Hong Kong’s autonomy until 2047; 
however, if China were to exert its authority so as to alter the economic, 
political, or legal structures or the existing social policy of Hong Kong, 
investor and business confidence in Hong Kong could be negatively affected, 
which in turn could negatively affect markets and business performance. In 
addition, Hong Kong’s economy has entered a recession as a result of the current 
global economic crisis. Near term improvement in its economy appears unlikely. 

Taiwan. For decades, a state 
of hostility has existed between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. 
Beijing has long deemed Taiwan a part of the “one China” and has made a 
nationalist cause of recovering it. In the past, China has staged frequent 
military provocations off the coast of Taiwan and made threats of full-scale 
military action. Foreign trade has been the engine of rapid growth in Taiwan and 
has transformed the island into one of Asia’s great exporting nations. However, 
investing in Taiwan involves the possibility of the imposition of exchange 
controls, such as restrictions on the repatriation of fund investments or on the 
conversion of local currency into foreign currencies. As an export-oriented 
economy, Taiwan depends on an open world trade regime and remains 
 
Part II - 56 


vulnerable to downturns in the world 
economy. Taiwanese companies continue to compete mostly on price, producing 
generic products or branded merchandise on behalf of multinational companies. 
Accordingly, these businesses can be particularly vulnerable to currency 
volatility and increasing competition from neighboring lower-cost countries. 
Moreover, many Taiwanese companies are heavily invested in mainland China and 
other countries throughout Southeast Asia, making them susceptible to political 
events and economic crises in these parts of the region. Although Taiwan has not 
yet suffered any major economic setbacks due to the current global economic 
crisis, it is possible its economy could still be impacted. 
The China Region Fund may hold a 
significant weighting in securities listed on either the Shanghai and/or 
Shenzhen stock exchanges. Securities listed on these exchanges are divided into 
two classes, A shares, which are mostly limited to domestic investors, and B 
shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The 
China Region Fund’s exposure to securities listed on either the Shanghai or 
Shenzhen exchanges will initially be through B shares. The government of China 
has announced plans to exchange B shares for A shares and to merge the two 
markets. Such an event may produce greater liquidity and stability for the 
combined markets. However, it is uncertain whether or the extent to which these 
plans will be implemented. In addition to B shares, the China Region Fund may 
also invest in Hong Kong listed H shares, Hong Kong listed Red chips (which are 
companies owned by mainland China enterprises, but are listed in Hong Kong), and 
companies that meet one of the following categories: the company is organized 
under the laws of, or has a principal office in China (including Hong Kong and 
Macau) or Taiwan; the principal securities market for the issuer is China or 
Taiwan; the issuer derives at least 50% of its total revenues or profits from 
goods that are produced or sold, investments made, or services performed in 
China or Taiwan; or at least 50% of the issuer’s assets are located in China or 
Taiwan. 
Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect 
and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect. 
The Funds may invest in certain China A-Shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock 
Connect program or the Shenzhen-Hong 
Kong Stock Connect Program (the “Programs”). The Programs are securities trading 
and clearing linked programs developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 
Limited (“HKEx”), the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (“HKSCC”), 
Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”), Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”) and China 
Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (“ChinaClear”) with an 
objective to achieve mutual stock market access between mainland China and Hong 
Kong. The Programs will allow foreign investors to trade certain SSE and SZSE 
listed China A-Shares through Hong Kong 
based brokers. 
Trading through the Programs are 
subject to various risks described below, including liquidity risk, currency 
risk, legal and regulatory uncertainty risk, execution risk, operational risk, 
tax risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. 
Securities purchased under each 
Program generally may not be sold, purchased or otherwise transferred other than 
through that Program in accordance with applicable rules. While each Program is 
not subject to individual investment quotas, daily investment quotas apply to 
all Program participants, which may restrict or preclude the Fund’s ability to 
purchase particular securities at a particular time. In addition, securities 
purchased through the Programs are subject to Chinese securities regulations 
that restrict the levels of foreign ownership in local securities, which could 
require a Fund to sell securities if ownership of the securities exceeds 
applicable quotas. Furthermore, additional restrictions may preclude a Fund from 
being eligible to invest in certain securities traded through a Program. Because 
all trades in the Programs must be settled in Renminbi (RMB), the Chinese 
currency, investors must have timely access to a reliable supply of offshore 
RMB, which cannot be guaranteed. Trades through each Program are subject to 
certain requirements prior to trading which may limit the number of brokers that 
a Fund may use. This may affect the quality of execution received by a Fund. In 
addition, applicable laws may, under certain circumstances, require an investor 
to return profits obtained from the purchase and sale of shares. 
The HKSCC provides clearing, 
settlement, nominee functions and other related services of the trades executed 
by Hong Kong market participants through an arrangement with ChinaClear. The 
People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) regulations, which include certain 
restrictions on selling and buying, will apply to all market participants. In 
the case of a sale, brokers must have access to certain information about the 
transaction prior to execution. Because of the various requirements and 
restrictions applicable to the Programs, a Fund may not be able to purchase 
and/or dispose of holdings of China A-Shares in a timely manner. 
A Fund will not benefit from access 
to local investor compensation funds, which are set up to protect against 
defaults of trades, when investing through each Program. To the extent that 
HKSCC is deemed to be performing safekeeping functions with respect to assets 
held through it, it should be noted that the Fund will have no legal 
relationship with HKSCC and no direct legal recourse against HKSCC in the event 
that the Fund suffers losses resulting from the performance or insolvency of 
HKSCC. 
 
Part II - 57 


The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect 
Program began operation in November 2014 and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect Program 
began operation in December 2016. The relevant regulations relating to the 
Programs are untested and subject to change. There is no certainty as to how 
they will be applied which could adversely affect a Fund. The Programs require 
use of new information technology systems which may be subject to operational 
risk due to its cross-border nature. If the relevant systems fail to function 
properly, trading in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets through the Programs 
could be disrupted. 
As in other emerging and less 
developed markets, the legislative framework is only beginning to develop the 
concept of legal/formal ownership and of beneficial ownership or interest in 
securities in China. Consequently the applicable courts may consider that any 
nominee or custodian as registered holder of securities would have full 
ownership thereof and that a beneficial owner may have no rights whatsoever in 
respect thereof and may be limited in its ability to pursue claims against the 
issuer of a security. Additionally, the securities that a Fund may invest in 
through the Programs may present illiquidity and price volatility concerns and 
difficulty in determining market valuations of securities due to limited public 
information on issuers. Such securities may also be subject to limited 
regulatory oversight and an increased risk of being delisted or suspended. 
Suspensions or delistings may become widespread, and the length of any 
suspension may be significant and difficult to predict. 
The Programs utilize an omnibus 
clearing structure, and a Fund’s shares will be registered in its custodian’s, 
subcustodian’s or clearing broker’s name on the HKSCC system and in HKSCC’s name 
on the ChinaClear system. This may limit a Fund’s adviser’s or subadviser’s 
ability to effectively manage a Fund, and may expose a Fund to the credit risk 
of its custodian or subcustodian or to greater risk of expropriation. 

Similarly, HKSCC would be 
responsible for the exercise of shareholder rights with respect to corporate 
actions (including all dividends, rights issues, merger proposals or other 
shareholder votes). While HKSCC may provide investors with the opportunity to 
provide voting instructions, investors may not have sufficient time or the 
opportunity to consider proposals or provide instructions. 
Investments in the Programs may not 
be covered by the securities investor protection programs of either exchange 
and, without the protection of such programs, will be subject to the risk of 
default by a broker. In the event ChinaClear defaults, HKSCC’s liabilities under 
its market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting 
clearing participants with claims. While it is anticipated that HKSCC will act 
in good faith to seek recovery of the outstanding stocks and monies from 
ChinaClear through available legal channels or the liquidation of ChinaClear, 
there can be no assurances that it will do so, or that it will be successful in 
doing so. In this event, the Fund may not fully recover its losses and the 
process could be delayed. 
The Programs will only operate on 
days when both the PRC and Hong Kong markets are open for trading and when banks 
in each applicable market are open on the corresponding settlement days and the 
Funds will only trade through each Program on days that they are open. There may 
be occasions when it is a normal trading day for the PRC market but the Fund 
cannot carry out any China A-Shares 
trading. A Fund may be subject to risks of price fluctuations in China A-Shares 
during the time when each Program is not trading as a result. Additionally, 
different fees and costs are imposed on foreign investors acquiring China A-Shares acquired through the Programs, and 
these fees and costs may be higher than comparable fees and costs imposed on 
owners of other securities providing similar investment exposure. There is 
uncertainty of whether and how certain gains on PRC securities will to be taxed, 
the possibility of the rules being changed and the possibility of taxes being 
applied retrospectively. Consequently, investors may be advantaged or 
disadvantaged depending upon the final outcome of how such gains will be taxed 
and when they subscribed and/or redeemed their shares. 
Because the Programs are relatively 
new, the actual effect on the market for trading China A-Shares with the introduction of large 
numbers of foreign investors is unknown. The Programs are subject to regulations 
promulgated by regulatory authorities for the applicable exchanges and further 
regulations or restrictions, such as limitations on redemptions or suspension of 
trading, may adversely impact the Programs, if the authorities believe it 
necessary to assure orderly markets or for other reasons. There is no guarantee 
that the exchanges will continue to support the Programs in the future. 

Investments in India 
Securities of many issuers in the 
Indian market may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable 
domestic issuers, but may offer the potential for higher returns over the long 
term. Indian securities will generally be denominated in foreign currency, 
mainly the rupee. Accordingly, the value of the Fund will fluctuate depending on 
the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and such foreign currency. India 
has less developed clearance and settlement procedures, and there have been 
times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with 
 
Part II - 58 


the volume of securities and have 
been significantly delayed. The Indian stock exchanges have in the past been 
subject to closure, broker defaults and broker strikes, and there can be no 
certainty that this will not recur. In addition, significant delays are common 
in registering transfers of securities and the Fund may be unable to sell 
securities until the registration process is completed and may experience delays 
in receipt of dividends and other entitlements. 
The value of investments in Indian 
securities may also be affected by political and economic developments, social, 
religious or regional tensions, changes in government regulation and government 
intervention, high rates of inflation or interest rates and withholding tax 
affecting India. The risk of loss may also be increased because there may be 
less information available about Indian issuers since they are not subject to 
the extensive accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and 
practices which are applicable in North America. There is also a lower level of 
regulation and monitoring of the Indian securities market and its participants 
than in other more developed markets. 
Foreign investment in the securities 
of issuers in India is usually restricted or controlled to some degree. In 
addition, the availability of financial instruments with exposure to Indian 
financial markets may be substantially limited by the restrictions on Foreign 
Institutional Investors (“FIIs”). Only registered FIIs and non-Indian mutual funds that comply with 
certain statutory conditions may make direct portfolio investments in 
exchange-traded Indian securities. JPMIM is a registered FII. FIIs are required 
to observe certain investment restrictions which may limit the Fund’s ability to 
invest in issuers or to fully pursue its investment objective. Income, gains and 
initial capital with respect to such investments are freely repatriable, subject 
to payment of applicable Indian taxes. 
India’s guidelines under which 
foreign investors may invest in Indian securities are new and evolving. There 
can be no assurance that these investment control regimes will not change in a 
way that makes it more difficult or impossible for a Fund to implement 
investment objective or repatriate its income, gains and initial capital from 
these countries. Similar risks and considerations will be applicable to the 
extent that a Fund invests in other countries. Recently, certain policies have 
served to restrict foreign investment, and such policies may have the effect of 
reducing demand for such investments. 
India may require withholding on 
dividends paid on portfolio securities and on realized capital gains. In the 
past, these taxes have sometimes been substantial. There can be no assurance 
that restrictions on repatriation of a Fund’s income, gains or initial capital 
from India will not occur. 
A high proportion of the shares of 
many issuers in India may be held by a limited number of persons and financial 
institutions, which may limit the number of shares available for investment. In 
addition, further issuances, or the perception that such issuances may occur, of 
securities by Indian issuers in which a Fund has invested could dilute the 
earnings per share of a Fund’s investment and could adversely affect the market 
price of such securities. Sales of securities by such issuer’s major 
shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, may also 
significantly and adversely affect the market price of such securities and, in 
turn, a Fund’s investment. The prices at which investments may be acquired may 
be affected by trading by persons with material non-public information and by securities 
transactions by brokers in anticipation of transactions by a Fund in particular 
securities. Similarly, volume and liquidity in the bond markets in India are 
less than in the United States and, at times, price volatility can be greater 
than in the United States. The limited liquidity of securities markets in India 
may also affect a Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the 
price and time it wishes to do so. In addition, India’s securities markets are 
susceptible to being influenced by large investors trading significant blocks of 
securities. 
India’s stock market is undergoing a 
period of growth and change which may result in trading volatility and 
difficulties in the settlement and recording of transactions, and in 
interpreting and applying the relevant law and regulations. The securities 
industry in India is comparatively underdeveloped. Stockbrokers and other 
intermediaries in India may not perform as well as their counterparts in the 
United States and other more developed securities markets. 
Political and economic structures in 
India are undergoing significant evolution and rapid development, and may lack 
the social, political and economic stability characteristic of the United 
States. The risks described above, including the risks of nationalization or 
expropriation of assets, may be heightened. In addition, unanticipated political 
or social developments may affect the values of investments in India and the 
availability of additional investments. The laws in India relating to limited 
liability of corporate shareholders, fiduciary duties of officers and directors, 
and the bankruptcy of state enterprises are generally less well developed than 
or different from such laws in the United States. It may be more difficult to 
obtain or enforce a judgment in the courts in India than it is in the United 
States. Monsoons and natural disasters also can affect the value of investments. 

Religious and border disputes 
persist in India. Moreover, India has from time to time experienced civil unrest 
and hostilities with neighboring countries such as Pakistan. The Indian 
government has confronted separatist movements in several Indian states. The 
longstanding dispute with Pakistan over the bordering Indian state of 

 
Part II - 59 


Jammu and Kashmir, a majority of 
whose population is Muslim, remains unresolved. If the Indian government is 
unable to control the violence and disruption associated with these tensions, 
the results could destabilize the economy and consequently, adversely affect the 
Fund’s investments. 
A Fund may use P-notes. Indian-based 
brokerages may buy Indian-based securities and then issue P-notes to foreign 
investors. Any dividends or capital gains collected from the underlying 
securities may be remitted to the foreign investors. However, unlike ADRs, notes 
are subject to credit risk based on the uncertainty of the counterparty’s (i.e., 
the Indian-based brokerage’s) ability to meet its obligations. 
Investments in Japan 
The Japanese economy may be subject 
to economic, political and social instability, which could have a negative 
impact on Japanese securities. In the past, Japan’s economic growth rate has 
remained relatively low, and it may remain low in the future. At times, the 
Japanese economy has been adversely impacted by government intervention and 
protectionism, changes in its labor market, and an unstable financial services 
sector. International trade, government support of the financial services sector 
and other troubled sectors, government policy, natural disasters and/or 
geopolitical developments could significantly affect the Japanese economy. A 
significant portion of Japan’s trade is conducted with developing nations and 
can be affected by conditions in these nations or by currency fluctuations. 
Japan is an island state with few natural resources and limited land area and is 
reliant on imports for its commodity needs. Any fluctuations or shortages in the 
commodity markets could have a negative impact on the Japanese economy. 

Investments in the Middle East and Africa 

Certain countries in the region are 
in early stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration 
of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers 
representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of 
investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers may be fewer in number and less 
well capitalized than brokers in more developed regions. Certain economies in 
the region depend to a significant degree upon exports of commodities and are 
vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which in turn may be affected by a 
variety of factors. In addition, certain governments in the region have 
exercised substantial influence over the private sector, including ownership or 
control of companies. Governmental actions in the future could have a 
significant economic impact. Certain armed conflict, territorial disputes, 
historical animosities, regional instability, terrorist activities and 
religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Such developments could have a 
negative effect on economic growth and could result in significant disruptions 
in the securities markets, including securities held by a Fund. Certain Middle 
Eastern and African countries have currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, which, 
if abandoned, could cause sudden and significant currency adjustments, which 
could impact the Fund’s investment returns in those countries. The legal 
systems, and the unpredictability thereof, in certain countries in the region 
also may have an adverse impact on the Fund and may expose the Fund to 
significant or unlimited liabilities. Investment in certain countries in the 
region by the Fund may be restricted or prohibited under applicable regulation, 
and the Fund, as a foreign investor, may be required to obtain approvals and may 
have to invest on less advantageous terms (including price) than nationals. A 
Fund’s investments in securities of a country in the region may be subject to 
economic sanctions or other government restrictions, which may negatively impact 
the value or liquidity of the Fund’s investments. Investments in the region may 
adversely impact the operations of the Fund through the delay of the Fund’s 
ability to exercise its rights as a security holder. Substantial limitations may 
exist in the region with respect to the Fund’s ability to repatriate investment 
income, capital gains or its investment. Securities which are subject to 
material legal restrictions on repatriation of assets will be considered 
illiquid securities by the Fund and subject to the limitations on illiquid 
investments. 
Investments in Latin America 
As an emerging market, Latin America 
has long suffered from political, economic, and social instability. For 
investors, this has meant additional risk caused by periods of regional 
conflict, political corruption, totalitarianism, protectionist measures, 
nationalization, hyperinflation, debt crises, sudden and large currency 
devaluation, and intervention by the military in civilian and economic spheres. 
However, much has changed in the past decade. Democracy is beginning to become 
well established in some countries. A move to a more mature and accountable 
political environment is well under way. Domestic economies have been 
deregulated, privatization of state-owned companies is almost completed and 
foreign trade restrictions have been relaxed. Nonetheless, to the extent that 
events such as those listed above continue in the future, they could reverse 
favorable trends toward market and economic reform, privatization, and removal 
of trade barriers, and result in significant disruption in securities markets in 
the region. Investors in the region continue to face a number of potential 
risks. Governments of many Latin American countries have exercised and continue 
to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. 

 
Part II - 60 


Governmental actions in the future 
could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Latin American 
countries, which could affect the companies in which the Latin America Fund 
invests and, therefore, the value of Fund shares. 
Certain Latin American countries may 
experience sudden and large adjustments in their currency which, in turn, can 
have a disruptive and negative effect on foreign investors. For example, in late 
1994 the Mexican peso lost more than one-third of its value relative to the U.S. 
dollar. In 1999, the Brazilian real lost 30% of its value against the U.S. 
dollar. Certain Latin American countries may impose restrictions on the free 
conversion of their currency into foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar. 
There is no significant foreign exchange market for many currencies and it 
would, as a result, be difficult for certain Funds to engage in foreign currency 
transactions designed to protect the value of the Funds’ interests in securities 
denominated in such currencies. 
Almost all of the region’s economies 
have become highly dependent upon foreign credit and loans from external sources 
to fuel their state-sponsored economic plans. Government profligacy and ill-conceived plans for modernization have 
exhausted these resources with little benefit accruing to the economy and most 
countries have been forced to restructure their loans or risk default on their 
debt obligations. In addition, interest on the debt is subject to market 
conditions and may reach levels that would impair economic activity and create a 
difficult and costly environment for borrowers. Accordingly, these governments 
may be forced to reschedule or freeze their debt repayment, which could 
negatively affect the stock market. Latin American economies that depend on 
foreign credit and loans could fall into recession because of tighter 
international credit supplies due to the current global economic crisis. 

Substantial limitations may exist in 
certain countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment 
income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities. A Fund could be 
adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required 
governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application 
to the Fund of any restrictions on investments. 
Certain Latin American countries 
have entered into regional trade agreements that are designed to, among other 
things, reduce barriers between countries, increase competition among companies 
and reduce government subsidies in certain industries. No assurance can be given 
that these changes will be successful in the long term, or that these changes 
will result in the economic stability intended. There is a possibility that 
these trade arrangements will not be fully implemented, or will be partially or 
completely unwound. It is also possible that a significant participant could 
choose to abandon a trade agreement, which could diminish its credibility and 
influence. Any of these occurrences could have adverse effects on the markets of 
both participating and non-participating countries, including sharp 
appreciation or depreciation of participants’ national currencies and a 
significant increase in exchange rate volatility, a resurgence in economic 
protectionism, an undermining of confidence in the Latin American markets, an 
undermining of Latin American economic stability, the collapse or slowdown of 
the drive towards Latin American economic unity, and/or reversion of the 
attempts to lower government debt and inflation rates that were introduced in 
anticipation of such trade agreements. Such developments could have an adverse 
impact on a Fund’s investments in Latin America generally or in specific 
countries participating in such trade agreements. 
Terrorism and related geo-political risks have led, and may in the 
future lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have adverse 
long-term effects on world economies and markets generally. 
Investments in Russia 
Investing in Russian securities is 
highly speculative and involves significant risks and special considerations not 
typically associated with investing in the securities markets of the U.S. and 
most other developed countries. 
Over the past century, Russia has 
experienced political, social and economic turbulence and has endured decades of 
communist rule under which the property of tens of millions of its citizens was 
collectivized into state agricultural and industrial enterprises. Since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia’s government has been faced with the 
daunting task of stabilizing its domestic economy, while transforming it into a 
modern and efficient structure able to compete in international markets and 
respond to the needs of its citizens. However, to date, many of the country’s 
economic reform initiatives have floundered as the proceeds of International 
Monetary Fund and other economic assistance have been squandered or stolen. In 
this environment, there is always the risk that the nation’s government will 
abandon the current program of economic reform and replace it with radically 
different political and economic policies that would be detrimental to the 
interests of foreign investors. This could entail a return to a centrally 
planned economy and nationalization of private enterprises similar to what 
existed in the Soviet Union. 
Many of Russia’s businesses have 
failed to mobilize the available factors of production because the country’s 
privatization program virtually ensured the predominance of the old management 
teams that are largely non-market-oriented in their management 
approach. Poor accounting standards, inept management, pervasive corruption, 
insider 
 
Part II - 61 


trading and crime, and inadequate 
regulatory protection for the rights of investors all pose a significant risk, 
particularly to foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that the 
Russian tax system will not be reformed to prevent inconsistent, retroactive, 
and/or exorbitant taxation, or, in the alternative, the risk that a reformed tax 
system may result in the inconsistent and unpredictable enforcement of the new 
tax laws. 
Compared to most national stock 
markets, the Russian securities market suffers from a variety of problems not 
encountered in more developed markets. There is little long-term historical data 
on the Russian securities market because it is relatively new and a substantial 
proportion of securities transactions in Russia are privately negotiated outside 
of stock exchanges. The inexperience of the Russian securities market and the 
limited volume of trading in securities in the market may make obtaining 
accurate prices on portfolio securities from independent sources more difficult 
than in more developed markets. Additionally, because of less stringent auditing 
and financial reporting standards that apply to companies operating in Russia, 
there is little solid corporate information available to investors. As a result, 
it may be difficult to assess the value or prospects of an investment in Russian 
companies. Stocks of Russian companies also may experience greater price 
volatility than stocks of U.S. companies. 
Settlement, clearing and 
registration of securities transactions in Russia are subject to additional 
risks because of the recent formation of the Russian securities market, the 
underdeveloped state of the banking and telecommunications systems, and the 
overall legal and regulatory framework. Prior to 2013, there was no central 
registration system for equity share registration in Russia and registration was 
carried out by either the issuers themselves or by registrars located throughout 
Russia. Such registrars were not necessarily subject to effective state 
supervision nor were they licensed with any governmental entity, thereby 
increasing the risk that a Fund could lose ownership of its securities through 
fraud, negligence, or even mere oversight. With the implementation of the 
National Settlement Depository (“NSD”) in Russia as a recognized central 
securities depository, title to Russian equities is now based on the records of 
the Depository and not the registrars. Although the implementation of the NSD is 
generally expected to decrease the risk of loss in connection with recording and 
transferring title to securities, issues resulting in loss still might occur. In 
addition, issuers and registrars are still prominent in the validation and 
approval of documentation requirements for corporate action processing in 
Russia. Because the documentation requirements and approval criteria vary 
between registrars and/or issuers, there remain unclear and inconsistent market 
standards in the Russian market with respect to the completion and submission of 
corporate action elections. To the extent that a Fund suffers a loss relating to 
title or corporate actions relating to its portfolio securities, it may be 
difficult for the Fund to enforce its rights or otherwise remedy the loss. 

The Russian economy is heavily 
dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial 
metals, forestry products, oil, and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by 
international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable to any weakening 
in global demand for these products. 
Foreign investors also face a high 
degree of currency risk when investing in Russian securities and a lack of 
available currency hedging instruments. In a surprise move in August 1998, 
Russia devalued the ruble, defaulted on short-term domestic bonds, and imposed a 
moratorium on the repayment of its international debt and the restructuring of 
the repayment terms. These actions have negatively affected Russian borrowers’ 
ability to access international capital markets and have had a damaging impact 
on the Russian economy. In light of these and other government actions, foreign 
investors face the possibility of further devaluations. In addition, there is a 
risk that the government may impose capital controls on foreign portfolio 
investments in the event of extreme financial or political crisis. Such capital 
controls would prevent the sale of a portfolio of foreign assets and the 
repatriation of investment income and capital. The current economic turmoil in 
Russia and the effects on the current global economic crisis on the Russian 
economy may cause flight from the Russian ruble into U.S. dollars and other 
currencies, which could force the Russian central bank to spend reserves to 
maintain the value of the ruble. If the Russian central bank falters in its 
defense of the ruble, there could be additional pressure on Russia’s banks and 
its currency. 
The United States may impose 
economic sanctions against companies in various sectors of the Russian economy, 
including, but not limited to, the financial services, energy, metals and 
mining, engineering, and defense and defense-related materials sectors. These 
sanctions, if imposed, could impair a Fund’s ability to invest in securities it 
views as attractive investment opportunities. For example, a Fund may be 
prohibited from investing in securities issued by companies subject to such 
sanctions. In addition, the sanctions may require a Fund to freeze its existing 
investments in Russian companies, prohibiting the Fund from selling or otherwise 
transacting in these investments. This could impact a Fund’s ability to sell 
securities or other financial instruments as needed to meet shareholder 
redemptions. 
Terrorism and related geo-political risks have led, and may in the 
future lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have adverse 
long-term effects on world economies and markets generally. 
 
Part II - 62 


RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
Each Fund may employ non-hedging risk management techniques. Risk 
management strategies are used to keep the Funds fully invested and to reduce 
the transaction costs associated with cash flows into and out of a Fund. The 
Funds use a wide variety of instruments and strategies for risk management and 
the examples below are not meant to be exhaustive. 
Examples of risk management 
strategies include synthetically altering the duration of a portfolio or the mix 
of securities in a portfolio. For example, if the Adviser wishes to extend 
maturities in a fixed income portfolio in order to take advantage of an 
anticipated decline in interest rates, but does not wish to purchase the 
underlying long-term securities, it might cause a Fund to purchase futures 
contracts on long term debt securities. Likewise, if the Adviser wishes to gain 
exposure to an instrument but does not wish to purchase the instrument it may 
use swaps and related instruments. Similarly, if the Adviser wishes to decrease 
exposure to fixed income securities or purchase equities, it could cause the 
Fund to sell futures contracts on debt securities and purchase futures contracts 
on a stock index. Such non-hedging risk 
management techniques involve leverage, and thus, present, as do all leveraged 
transactions, the possibility of losses as well as gains that are greater than 
if these techniques involved the purchase and sale of the securities themselves 
rather than their synthetic derivatives. 
SPECIAL FACTORS AFFECTING CERTAIN FUNDS 
In addition to the investment 
strategies and policies described above, certain Funds may employ other 
investment strategies and policies, or similar strategies and policies to a 
greater extent, and, therefore, may be subject to additional risks or similar 
risks to a greater extent. For instance, certain Funds which invest in certain 
state specific securities may be subject to special considerations regarding 
such investments. For a description of such additional investment strategies and 
policies as well as corresponding risks for such Funds, see Part I of this SAI. 

DIVERSIFICATION 
Certain Funds are diversified funds 
and as such intend to meet the diversification requirements of the 1940 Act. 
Please refer to the Funds’ Prospectuses for information about whether a Fund is 
a diversified or non-diversified Fund. 
Current 1940 Act diversification requirements require that with respect to 75% 
of the assets of a Fund, the Fund may not invest more than 5% of its total 
assets in the securities of any one issuer or own more than 10% of the 
outstanding voting securities of any one issuer, except cash or cash items, 
obligations of the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and 
securities of other investment companies. As for the other 25% of a Fund’s 
assets not subject to the limitation described above, there is no limitation on 
investment of these assets under the 1940 Act, so that all of such assets may be 
invested in securities of any one issuer. Investments not subject to the 
limitations described above could involve an increased risk to a Fund should an 
issuer be unable to make interest or principal payments or should the market 
value of such securities decline. 
Each of the Money Market Funds 
intends to comply with the diversification requirements imposed by Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act. 
Certain other Funds are registered 
as non-diversified investment 
companies. A Fund is considered “non-diversified” because a relatively high 
percentage of the Fund’s assets may be invested in the securities of a single 
issuer or a limited number of issuers, primarily within the same economic 
sector. A non-diversified Fund’s 
portfolio securities, therefore, may be more susceptible to any single economic, 
political, or regulatory occurrence than the portfolio securities of a more 
diversified investment company. 
Regardless of whether a Fund is 
diversified under the 1940 Act, all of the Funds will comply with the 
diversification requirements imposed by the Code for qualification as a 
regulated investment company. See “Distributions and Tax Matters.” 
DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAX MATTERS 
The following discussion is a brief 
summary of some of the important federal (and, where noted, state) income tax 
consequences affecting each Fund and its shareholders. There may be other tax 
considerations applicable to particular shareholders. Except as otherwise noted 
in a Fund’s Prospectus, the Funds are not intended for foreign shareholders. As 
a result, this section does not address in detail the tax consequences affecting 
any shareholder who, as to the U.S., is a nonresident alien individual, foreign 
trust or estate, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership. This section is 
based on the Code, the regulations thereunder, published rulings and court 
decisions, all as currently in effect. These laws are subject to change, 
possibly on a retroactive basis. The following tax discussion is very general; 
therefore, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors about 
the impact an investment in a Fund may have on their own tax situations and the 
possible application of foreign, state and local law. 
 
Part II - 63 


Each Fund generally will be treated 
as a separate entity for federal income tax purposes, and thus the provisions of 
the Code generally will be applied to each Fund separately. Net long-term and 
short-term capital gain, net income and operating expenses therefore will be 
determined separately for each Fund. 
Special tax rules apply to 
investments held through defined contribution plans and other tax-qualified plans. Shareholders should 
consult their tax advisors to determine the suitability of shares of the Fund as 
an investment through such plans. 
Qualification as a Regulated Investment Company 

Each Fund intends to elect to be 
treated and qualify each year as a regulated investment company under Subchapter 
M of the Code. In order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded 
regulated investment companies and their shareholders, each Fund must, among 
other things: 
 



 
(a)
derive at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year from 
      (i) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities 
      loans, and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, 
      or foreign currencies, or other income (including, but not limited to, 
      gain from options, swaps, futures, or forward contracts) derived with 
      respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or 
      currencies and (ii) net income derived from interests in “qualified 
      publicly traded partnerships” (“QPTPs”, defined below); 
  
 



 
(b)
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the 
      Fund’s taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the 
      Fund’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government 
      securities, securities of other regulated investment companies, and other 
      securities, limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater 
      than 5% of the value of the Fund’s total assets and not more than 10% of 
      the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more 
      than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets is invested (x) in 
      the securities (other than cash or cash items, or securities issued by the 
      U.S. government or other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer 
      or of two or more issuers that the Fund controls and that are engaged in 
      the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or (y) in the 
      securities of one or more QPTPs. In the case of a Fund’s investments in 
      loan participations, the Fund shall treat both the financial intermediary 
      and the issuer of the underlying loan as an issuer for the purposes of 
      meeting this diversification requirement; and 
 



 
(c)
distribute with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of the 
      sum of its investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in 
      the Code, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid — generally, 
      taxable ordinary income and any excess of net short-term capital gain over 
      net long-term capital loss) and net tax-exempt interest income, for such 
      taxable year. 
In general, for purposes of the 90% 
gross income requirement described in paragraph (a) above, income derived 
from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such 
income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be 
qualifying income if realized by the regulated investment company. However, 100% 
of the net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded 
partnership” (defined as a partnership (x) interests in which are traded on 
an established securities markets or readily tradable on a secondary market as 
the substantial equivalents thereof, (y) that derives at least 90% of its 
income from passive income sources defined in Section 7704(d) of the Code, and 
(z) that derives less than 90% of its income from the qualifying income 
described in (a)(i) above) will be treated as qualifying income. Although income 
from a QPTP is qualifying income, as discussed above, investments in QPTPs 
cannot exceed 25% of the Fund’s assets. In addition, although in general the 
passive loss rules of the Code do not apply to regulated investment companies, 
such rules do apply to a regulated investment company with respect to items 
attributable to an interest in a QPTP. 
Gains from foreign currencies 
(including foreign currency options, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency 
futures and foreign currency forward contracts) currently constitute qualifying 
income for purposes of the 90% test, described in paragraph (a) above. 
However, the Treasury Department has the authority to issue regulations 
(possibly with retroactive effect) excluding from the definition of “qualifying 
income” a fund’s foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not 
directly related to the fund’s principal business of investing in stock or 
securities. 
For purposes of paragraph 
(b) above, the term “outstanding voting securities of such issuer” will 
include the equity securities of a QPTP. A Fund’s investment in MLPs may qualify 
as an investment in (1) a QPTP, (2) a “regular” partnership, 
(3) a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”) or (4) a 
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The treatment of particular 
MLPs for U.S. federal income tax purposes will affect the extent to which a Fund 
can invest in MLPs. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of a Fund’s 
investments in “PFICs” and “regular” partnerships are discussed in greater 
detail below. 
 
Part II - 64 


If a Fund qualifies for a taxable 
year as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment, 
the Fund will not be subject to federal income tax on income distributed in a 
timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends (including Capital 
Gain Dividends, defined below). If a Fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated 
investment company accorded special tax treatment in any taxable year, the Fund 
would be subject to taxation on its taxable income at corporate rates, and all 
distributions from earnings and profits, including any distributions of net 
tax-exempt income and net long-term 
capital gain, would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Some portions 
of such distributions may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in 
the case of corporate shareholders and for treatment as qualified dividend 
income in the case of individual shareholders. In addition, the Fund could be 
required to recognize unrealized gain, pay substantial taxes and interest, and 
make substantial distributions before re-qualifying as a regulated investment 
company that is accorded special tax treatment. 
Each Fund intends to distribute at 
least annually to its shareholders all or substantially all of its investment 
company taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction) 
and may distribute its net capital gain (that is the excess of net long-term 
capital gain over net short-term capital loss). Investment company taxable 
income which is retained by a Fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate 
tax rates. A Fund might also retain for investment its net capital gain. If a 
Fund does retain such net capital gain, such gain will be subject to tax at 
regular corporate rates on the amount retained, but the Fund may designate the 
retained amount as undistributed capital gain in a notice to its shareholders 
who (i) will be required to include in income for federal income tax 
purposes, as long-term capital gain, their respective shares of the 
undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their respective 
shares of the tax paid by the Fund on such undistributed amount against their 
federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the 
credit exceeds such liabilities. For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis 
of shares owned by a shareholder of a Fund will be increased by an amount equal 
under current law to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital 
gain included in the shareholder’s gross income and the tax deemed paid by the 
shareholder under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence. 
In determining its net capital gain, 
including in connection with determining the amount available to support a 
Capital Gain Dividend, its taxable income and its earnings and profits, a Fund 
may elect to treat part or all of any post-October capital loss (defined as the 
greatest of net capital loss, net long-term capital loss, or net short-term 
capital loss, in each case attributable to the portion of the taxable year after 
October 31) or late-year ordinary loss (generally, (i) net ordinary 
loss from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of property, 
attributable to the portion of the taxable year after October 31, plus 
(ii) other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion of the taxable 
year after December 31) as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year. 

Excise Tax on Regulated Investment Companies 

If a Fund fails to distribute in a 
calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of 98% of its ordinary income 
(taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such year and 98.2% of 
its capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 (or 
later if the Fund is permitted to elect and so elects), plus any retained amount 
from the prior year, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax 
on the undistributed amounts. The Funds intend to make distributions sufficient 
to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax, although each Fund reserves the right 
to pay an excise tax rather than make an additional distribution when 
circumstances warrant (e.g., the excise tax amount is deemed by a Fund to be 
de minimis). Certain derivative instruments give rise to ordinary income 
and loss. If a Fund has a taxable year that begins in one calendar year and ends 
in the next calendar year, the Fund will be required to make this excise tax 
distribution during its taxable year. There is a risk that a Fund could 
recognize income prior to making this excise tax distribution and could 
recognize losses after making this distribution. As a result, all or a portion 
of an excise tax distribution could constitute a return of capital (see 
discussion below). 
Fund 
Distributions 
The Funds anticipate distributing 
substantially all of their net investment income for each taxable year. 
Distributions are taxable to shareholders even if they are paid from income or 
gain earned by the Fund before a shareholder’s investment (and thus were 
included in the price the shareholder paid). Distributions are taxable whether 
shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares. A 
shareholder whose distributions are reinvested in shares will be treated as 
having received a dividend equal to the amount of cash that the shareholder 
would have received if such shareholder had elected to receive the distribution 
in cash. 
Dividends and distributions on a 
Fund’s shares generally are subject to federal income tax as described herein to 
the extent they do not exceed the Fund’s realized income and gains, even though 
such dividends and distributions may represent economically a return of a 
particular shareholder’s investment. Such dividends and distributions are likely 
to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when the Fund’s net asset 
value reflects gains that are either (i) unrealized, or (ii) realized 
but not distributed. 
 
Part II - 65 


For federal income tax purposes, 
distributions of net investment income generally are taxable as ordinary income. 
Taxes on distributions of capital gain are determined by how long a Fund owned 
the investment that generated it, rather than how long a shareholder may have 
owned shares in the Fund. Distributions of net capital gain from the sale of 
investments that a Fund owned for more than one year and that are properly 
designated by the Fund as capital gain dividends (“Capital Gain Dividends”) will 
be taxable as long-term capital gain. Distributions of capital gain generally 
are made after applying any available capital loss carryovers. The maximum 
individual rate applicable to long-term capital gains is either 15% or 20%, 
depending on whether the individual’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts. 
A distribution of gain from the sale of investments that a Fund owned for one 
year or less will be taxable as ordinary income. Distributions attributable to 
gain from the sale of MLPs that is characterized as ordinary income under the 
Code’s recapture provisions will be taxable as ordinary income. 
Distributions of investment income 
designated by a Fund as derived from “qualified dividend income” will be taxed 
in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to long-term capital gain. 
In order for some portion of the dividends received by a Fund shareholder to be 
qualified dividend income, the Fund must meet certain holding-period and other 
requirements with respect to some portion of the dividend-paying stocks in its 
portfolio, and the shareholder must meet certain holding-period and other 
requirements with respect to the Fund’s shares. A dividend will not be treated 
as qualified dividend income (at either the Fund or shareholder level) 
(i) if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for 
fewer than 61 days during the 121-day 
period beginning on the date which is 60 days before the date on which such 
share becomes ex-dividend with respect 
to such dividend (or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 
181-day period beginning 90 days before 
such date), (ii) to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation 
(whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with 
respect to positions in substantially similar or related property, (iii) if 
the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment interest 
for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest, or 
(iv) if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is 
(a) not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with 
the U.S. (with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign 
corporation readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S.) or 
(b) treated as a PFIC. 
In general, distributions of 
investment income designated by a Fund as derived from qualified dividend income 
will be treated as qualified dividend income by a non-corporate taxable shareholder so long as 
the shareholder meets the holding period and other requirements described above 
with respect to the Fund’s shares. In any event, if the qualified dividend 
income received by each Fund during any taxable year is equal to or greater than 
95% of its “gross income”, then 100% of the Fund’s dividends (other than 
dividends that are properly designated as Capital Gain Dividends) will be 
eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income. For this purpose, the only 
gain included in the term “gross income” is the excess of net short-term capital 
gain over net long-term capital loss. 
If a Fund receives dividends from an 
underlying fund, and the underlying fund designates such dividends as “qualified 
dividend income,” then the Fund may, in turn, designate a portion of its 
distributions as “qualified dividend income” as well, provided the Fund meets 
the holding-period and other requirements with respect to shares of the 
underlying fund. 
Any loss realized upon a taxable 
disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term 
capital loss to the extent of any Capital Gain Dividends received by the 
shareholder with respect to those shares. All or a portion of any loss realized 
upon a taxable disposition of Fund shares will be disallowed if other shares of 
such Fund are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such 
a case, the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the 
disallowed loss. 
A distribution paid to shareholders 
by a Fund in January of a year generally is deemed to have been received by 
shareholders on December 31 of the preceding year, if the distribution was 
declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in October, November, 
or December of that preceding year. The Funds will provide federal tax 
information annually, including information about dividends and distributions 
paid during the preceding year to taxable investors and others requesting such 
information. 
If a Fund makes a distribution to 
its shareholders in excess of its current and accumulated “earnings and profits” 
in any taxable year, the excess distribution will be treated as a return of 
capital to the extent of each shareholder’s basis (for tax purposes) in its 
shares, and any distribution in excess of basis will be treated as capital gain. 
A return of capital is not taxable, but it reduces the shareholder’s basis in 
its shares, which reduces the loss (or increases the gain) on a subsequent 
taxable disposition by such shareholder of the shares. 
Dividends of net investment income 
received by corporate shareholders (other than shareholders that are 
S corporations) of a Fund will qualify for the 70% dividends-received 
deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of 
qualifying dividends received by the Fund from domestic corporations for the 
taxable year. A dividend received by a Fund will not be treated as a qualifying 
dividend (1) if the stock on which the 
 
Part II - 66 


dividend is paid is considered to be 
“debt-financed” (generally, acquired with borrowed funds), (2) if it has 
been received with respect to any share of stock that the Fund has held less 
than 46 days (91 days in the case of certain preferred stock) during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 
45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend 
(during the 181-day period beginning 90 
days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock) or (3) to the 
extent that the Fund is under an obligation (pursuant to a short sale or 
otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially 
similar or related property. Moreover, the dividends-received deduction may be 
disallowed or reduced (1) if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the 
foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of a Fund or (2) by 
application of the Code. However, any distributions received by a Fund from 
REITs and PFICs will not qualify for the corporate dividends-received deduction. 

An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is 
imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and 
capital gain distributions received from a Fund and net gains from redemptions 
or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares, but excluding any exempt interest 
dividends from a Fund) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent 
that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” (in the case of an 
individual) or “adjusted gross income” (in the case of an estate or trust) 
exceeds certain threshold amounts. 
Sale 
or Redemption of Shares 
The sale, exchange, or redemption of 
Fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss. In general, any gain or loss 
arising from (or treated as arising from) the sale or redemption of shares of 
the Fund will be considered capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital 
gain or loss if the shares were held for more than one year. However, any 
capital loss arising from the sale or redemption of shares held for six months 
or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount 
of capital gain dividends received on (or undistributed capital gains credited 
with respect to) such shares. Additionally, any loss realized upon the sale or 
exchange of Fund shares with a tax holding period of six months or less may be 
disallowed to the extent of any distributions treated as exempt interest 
dividends with respect to such shares. The maximum individual rate applicable to 
long-term capital gains is either 15% or 20%, depending on whether the 
individual’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Capital gain of a 
corporate shareholder is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. 
With respect to the Prime Money 
Market Fund, shareholders may elect to adopt a simplified “NAV method” for 
computing gains and losses from taxable sales, exchanges or redemptions of Fund 
shares. Under the NAV method, rather than computing gain or loss separately for 
each taxable disposition of Fund shares as described above, a shareholder would 
determine gain or loss based on the change in the aggregate value of the 
shareholder’s Fund shares during a computation period (which could be the 
shareholder’s taxable year or certain shorter periods), reduced by the 
shareholder’s net investment (purchases minus taxable sales, exchanges, or 
redemptions or exchanges) in those Fund shares during that period. Under the NAV 
method, if a shareholder holds the shares as a capital asset, any resulting net 
gain or loss would be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. 
Fund 
Investments 
Certain investments of the Funds, 
including transactions in options, swaptions, futures contracts, forward 
contracts, straddles, swaps, short sales, foreign currencies, inflation-linked 
securities and foreign securities, including for hedging purposes, will be 
subject to special tax rules (including mark-to-market, constructive sale, 
straddle, wash sale and short sale rules). In a given case, these rules may 
accelerate income to a Fund, defer losses to a Fund, cause adjustments in the 
holding periods of a Fund’s securities, convert long-term capital gain into 
short-term capital gain, convert short-term capital losses into long-term 
capital loss, or otherwise affect the character of a Fund’s income. These rules 
could therefore affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to 
shareholders and cause differences between a Fund’s book income and its taxable 
income. If a Fund’s book income exceeds its taxable income, the distribution (if 
any) of such excess generally will be treated as (i) a dividend to the 
extent of the Fund’s remaining earnings and profits (including earnings and 
profits arising from tax-exempt 
income), (ii) thereafter, as a return of capital to the extent of the 
recipient’s basis in its shares, and (iii) thereafter, as gain from the 
sale or exchange of a capital asset. If a Fund’s book income is less than 
taxable income, the Fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book 
income to qualify as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax 
treatment. Income earned as a result of these transactions would, in general, 
not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or for treatment as 
exempt-interest dividends when distributed to shareholders. The Funds will 
endeavor to make any available elections pertaining to such transactions in a 
manner believed to be in the best interest of each Fund and its shareholders. 

The Fund’s participation in loans of 
securities may affect the amount, timing, and character of distributions to 
shareholders. With respect to any security subject to a securities loan, any 
(i) amounts received by the Fund in place 
 
Part II - 67 


of dividends earned on the security 
during the period that such security was not directly held by the Fund will not 
give rise to qualified dividend income and (ii) withholding taxes accrued 
on dividends during the period that such security was not directly held by the 
Fund will not qualify as a foreign tax paid by the Fund and therefore cannot be 
passed through to shareholders even if the Fund meets the requirements described 
in “Foreign Taxes,” below. 
Certain debt securities purchased by 
the Funds are sold at an original issue discount and thus do not make periodic 
cash interest payments. Similarly, zero-coupon bonds do not make periodic 
interest payments. Generally, the amount of the original issue discount is 
treated as interest income and is included in taxable income (and required to be 
distributed) over the term of the debt security even though payment of that 
amount is not received until a later time, usually when the debt security 
matures. In addition, payment-in-kind securities will give 
rise to income that is required to be distributed and is taxable even though the 
Fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security 
during the year. Because each Fund distributes substantially all of its net 
investment income to its shareholders (including such imputed interest), a Fund 
may have to sell portfolio securities in order to generate the cash necessary 
for the required distributions. Such sales may occur at a time when the Adviser 
would not otherwise have chosen to sell such securities and may result in a 
taxable gain or loss. Some of the Funds may invest in inflation-linked debt 
securities. Any increase in the principal amount of an inflation-linked debt 
security will be original issue discount, which is taxable as ordinary income 
and is required to be distributed, even though the Fund will not receive the 
principal, including any increase thereto, until maturity. A Fund investing in 
such securities may be required to liquidate other investments, including at 
times when it is not advantageous to do so, in order to satisfy its distribution 
requirements and to eliminate any possible taxation at the Fund level. Certain 
debt securities that may be acquired by a Fund in the secondary market may be 
treated as having market discount. Generally, any gain recognized on the 
disposition of, and any partial payment of principal on, a debt security having 
market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain, or 
principal payment, does not exceed the “accrued market discount” on such debt 
security. Market discount generally accrues in equal daily installments. A Fund 
may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt securities having 
market discount, which could affect the character and timing of recognition of 
income. 
A Fund may invest to a significant 
extent in debt obligations that are in the lowest rated categories (or are 
unrated), including debt obligations of issuers that are not currently paying 
interest or that are in default. Investments in debt obligations that are at 
risk of being in default (or are presently in default) present special tax 
issues for a Fund. Tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when a 
Fund may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, 
when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless 
securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be 
allocated between principal and income. These and other related issues will be 
addressed by each Fund when, as and if it invests in such securities, in order 
to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status 
as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to U.S. federal 
income taxation or any excise tax. 
Transactions of certain Funds in 
foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated debt securities and certain 
foreign currency options, future contracts and forward contracts (and similar 
instruments) may accelerate income recognition and result in ordinary income or 
loss to a Fund for federal income tax purposes which will be taxable to the 
shareholders as such when it is distributed to them. 
Special tax considerations apply if 
a Fund invests in investment companies that are taxable as partnerships for 
federal income tax purposes. In general, the Fund will not recognize income 
earned by such an investment company until the close of the investment company’s 
taxable year. But the Fund will recognize such income as it is earned by the 
investment company for purposes of determining whether it is subject to the 4% 
excise tax. Therefore, if the Fund and such an investment company have different 
taxable years, the Fund may be compelled to make distributions in excess of the 
income recognized from such an investment company in order to avoid the 
imposition of the 4% excise tax. A Fund’s receipt of a non-liquidating cash distribution from an 
investment company taxable as a partnership generally will result in recognized 
gain (but not loss) only to the extent that the amount of the distribution 
exceeds the Fund’s adjusted basis in shares of such investment company before 
the distribution. A Fund that receives a liquidating cash distribution from an 
investment company taxable as a partnership will recognize capital gain or loss 
to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by the Fund and 
the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in shares of such investment company; however, the 
Fund will recognize ordinary income, rather than capital gain, to the extent 
that the Fund’s allocable share of “unrealized receivables” (including any 
accrued but untaxed market discount) exceeds the shareholder’s share of the 
basis in those unrealized receivables. 
Some amounts received by each Fund 
with respect to its investments in MLPs will likely be treated as a return of 
capital because of accelerated deductions available with respect to the 
activities of such MLPs. On the disposition of an investment in such an MLP, the 
Fund will likely realize taxable income in excess of economic gain with respect 
to that asset (or, if the Fund does not dispose of the MLP, the Fund likely will 
realize taxable income in 
 
Part II - 68 


excess of cash flow with respect to 
the MLP in a later period), and the Fund must take such income into account in 
determining whether the Fund has satisfied its distribution requirements. The 
Fund may have to borrow or liquidate securities to satisfy its distribution 
requirements and to meet its redemption requests, even though investment 
considerations might otherwise make it undesirable for the Fund to sell 
securities or borrow money at such time. 
Some of the Funds may invest in 
REITs. Such investments in REIT equity securities may require a Fund to accrue 
and distribute income not yet received. In order to generate sufficient cash to 
make the requisite distributions, the Fund may be required to sell securities in 
its portfolio (including when it is not advantageous to do so) that it otherwise 
would have continued to hold. A Fund’s investments in REIT equity securities may 
at other times result in the Fund’s receipt of cash in excess of the REIT’s 
earnings; if the Fund distributes such amounts, such distribution could 
constitute a return of capital to Fund shareholders for federal income tax 
purposes. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT generally will not constitute 
qualified dividend income. 
A Fund might invest directly or 
indirectly in residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits 
(“REMICs”) or equity interests in taxable mortgage pools (“TMPS”). Under a 
notice issued by the IRS in October 2006 and Treasury regulations that have not 
yet been issued (but may apply with retroactive effect) a portion of a Fund’s 
income from a REIT that is attributable to the REIT’s residual interest in a 
REMIC or a TMP (referred to in the Code as an “excess inclusion”) will be 
subject to federal income taxation in all events. This notice also provides, and 
the regulations are expected to provide, that excess inclusion income of a 
regulated investment company, such as each of the Funds, will generally be 
allocated to shareholders of the regulated investment company in proportion to 
the dividends received by such shareholders, with the same consequences as if 
the shareholders held the related REMIC or TMP residual interest directly. 

In general, excess inclusion income 
allocated to shareholders (i) cannot be offset by net operating losses 
(subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions) and 
(ii) will constitute unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) to entities 
(including a qualified pension plan, an individual retirement account, a 401(k) 
plan, a Keogh plan or other tax-exempt 
entity) subject to tax on UBTI, thereby potentially requiring such an entity 
that is allocated excess inclusion income, and otherwise might not be required 
to file a tax return, to file a tax return and pay tax on such income. In 
addition, because the Code provides that excess inclusion income is ineligible 
for treaty benefits, a regulated investment company must withhold tax on excess 
inclusions attributable to its foreign shareholders at a 30% rate of 
withholding, regardless of any treaty benefits for which a shareholder is 
otherwise eligible. 
Any investment in residual interests 
of a CMO that has elected to be treated as a REMIC can create complex tax 
problems, especially if the Fund has state or local governments or other tax-exempt organizations as shareholders. 
Under current law, the Fund serves to block UBTI from being realized by its 
tax-exempt shareholders. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder will recognize UBTI by 
virtue of its investment in the Fund if shares in the Fund constitute 
debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of 
Section 514(b) of the Code. Furthermore, a tax-exempt shareholder may recognize UBTI if 
the Fund recognizes “excess inclusion income” derived from direct or indirect 
investments in REMIC residual interests or TMPs if the amount of such income 
recognized by the Fund exceeds the Fund’s investment company taxable income 
(after taking into account deductions for dividends paid by the Fund). 

In addition, special tax 
consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts (“CRTs”) that invest in 
regulated investment companies that invest directly or indirectly in residual 
interests in REMICs or in TMPs. Under legislation enacted in December 2006, a 
CRT, as defined in Section 664 of the Code, that realizes UBTI for a taxable 
year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such UBTI. Under IRS 
guidance issued in October 2006, a CRT will not recognize UBTI solely as a 
result of investing in a Fund that recognizes “excess inclusion income.” Rather, 
if at any time during any taxable year a CRT (or one of certain other tax-exempt shareholders, such as the U.S., a 
state or political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, and 
certain energy cooperatives) is a record holder of a share in a Fund that 
recognizes “excess inclusion income,” then the Fund will be subject to a tax on 
that portion of its “excess inclusion income” for the taxable year that is 
allocable to such shareholders at the highest federal corporate income tax rate. 
The extent to which this IRS guidance remains applicable in light of the 
December 2006 legislation is unclear. To the extent permitted under the 1940 
Act, each Fund may elect to specially allocate any such tax to the applicable 
CRT, or other shareholder, and thus reduce such shareholder’s distributions for 
the year by the amount of the tax that relates to such shareholder’s interest in 
the Fund. The Funds have not yet determined whether such an election will be 
made. CRTs are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences 
of investing in a Fund. 
If a Fund invests in PFICs, certain 
special tax consequences may apply. A PFIC is any foreign corporation in which 
(i) 75% or more of the gross income for the taxable year is passive income, 
or (ii) the average percentage of 
 
Part II - 69 


the assets (generally by value, but 
by adjusted tax basis in certain cases) that produce or are held for the 
production of passive income is at least 50%. Generally, passive income for this 
purpose includes dividends, interest (including income equivalent to interest), 
royalties, rents, annuities, the excess of gains over losses from certain 
property transactions and commodities transactions, and foreign currency gains. 
Passive income for this purpose does not include rents and royalties received by 
the foreign corporation from active business and certain income received from 
related persons. A Fund’s investments in certain PFICs could subject the Fund to 
a U.S. federal income tax (including interest charges) on distributions received 
from the company or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the 
company. This tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to Fund 
shareholders. In addition, certain interest charges may be imposed on the Fund 
as a result of such distributions. 
If a Fund is in a position to treat 
a PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”), the Fund will be required to 
include in its gross income its share of the company’s income and net capital 
gain annually, regardless of whether it receives any distributions from the 
company. Alternately, a Fund may make an election to mark the gains (and to a 
limited extent losses) in such holdings “to the market” as though it had sold 
and repurchased its holdings in those PFICs on the last day of the Fund’s 
taxable year. Such gain and loss are treated as ordinary income and loss. The 
QEF and mark-to-market elections may have the 
effect of accelerating the recognition of income (without the receipt of cash) 
and increasing the amount required to be distributed by the Fund to avoid 
taxation. Making either of these elections, therefore, may require the Fund to 
liquidate other investments (including when it is not advantageous to do so) to 
meet its distribution requirement, which also may accelerate the recognition of 
gain and affect the Fund’s total return. A Fund that invests indirectly in PFICs 
by virtue of the Fund’s investment in other investment companies that qualify as 
“U.S. persons” within the meaning of the Code may not make a QEF election; 
rather, such underlying investment companies investing directly in the PFICs 
would decide whether to make such election. Dividends paid by PFICs will not be 
eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income.” 
Certain Funds have wholly-owned 
subsidiaries organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands, which are 
classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each, a 
“Subsidiary”). With respect to such Funds, a Fund may invest a portion of its 
assets in its Subsidiary. A foreign corporation, such as a Subsidiary, will 
generally not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless it is deemed to 
be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. It is expected that each Subsidiary will 
conduct its activities in a manner so as to meet the requirements of a safe 
harbor provided under Section 864(b)(2) of the Code under which the 
Subsidiary may engage in trading in stocks or securities or certain commodities 
without being deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, if 
certain of a Subsidiary’s activities were determined not to be of the type 
described in the safe harbor (which is not expected), then the activities of the 
Subsidiary may constitute a U.S. trade or business, and subject to U.S. taxation 
as such. 
In general, a foreign corporation, 
such as a Subsidiary, that does not conduct a U.S. trade or business is 
nonetheless subject to tax at a flat rate of 30 percent (or lower tax treaty 
rate), generally payable through withholding, on the gross amount of certain 
U.S.-source income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or 
business. There is presently no tax treaty in force between the U.S. and the 
Cayman Islands that would reduce this rate of withholding tax. It is not 
expected that a Subsidiary will derive meaningful income subject to such 
withholding tax. 
Each Subsidiary will be treated as a 
controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) and the Fund investing in its Subsidiary 
will be treated as a “U.S. shareholder” of that Subsidiary. As a result, a Fund 
will be required to include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
all of its Subsidiary’s “subpart F income,” whether or not such income is 
distributed by the Subsidiary. It is expected that all of the Subsidiary’s 
income will be “subpart F income.” A Fund’s recognition of its Subsidiary’s 
“subpart F income” will increase the Fund’s tax basis in the Subsidiary. 
Distributions by the Subsidiary to a Fund will be tax-free, to the extent of its 
previously undistributed “subpart F income,” and will correspondingly reduce the 
Fund’s tax basis in the Subsidiary. “Subpart F income” is generally treated as 
ordinary income, regardless of the character of the Subsidiary’s underlying 
income. If a net loss is realized by the Subsidiary, such loss is not generally 
available to offset the income earned by a Fund and such loss cannot be carried 
forward to offset taxable income of a Fund or the Subsidiary in future periods. 
The IRS recently issued proposed regulations that, if finalized, would generally 
treat a Fund’s income inclusion with respect to a Subsidiary as qualifying 
income only if there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the 
Subsidiary that are attributable to such income inclusion. The proposed 
regulations, if adopted, would apply to the Fund’s taxable years beginning on or 
after 90 days after the regulations are published as final. 
The ability of a Fund to invest 
directly in commodities, and in certain commodity-related securities and other 
instruments, is subject to significant limitations in order to enable a Fund to 
maintain its status as a regulated investment company under the Code. 

 
Part II - 70 


Investment in Other Funds 
If a Fund invests in shares of other 
mutual funds, ETFs or other companies that are taxable as regulated investment 
companies, as well as certain investments in REITs (collectively, “underlying 
funds”), its distributable income and gains will normally consist, in part, of 
distributions from the underlying funds and gains and losses on the disposition 
of shares of the underlying funds. To the extent that an underlying fund 
realizes net losses on its investments for a given taxable year, the Fund will 
not be able to recognize its share of those losses (so as to offset 
distributions of net income or capital gains from other underlying funds) until 
it disposes of shares of the underlying fund. Moreover, even when the Fund does 
make such a disposition, a portion of its loss may be recognized as a long-term 
capital loss, which will not be treated as favorably for federal income tax 
purposes as a short-term capital loss or an ordinary deduction. In particular, 
the Fund will not be able to offset any capital losses from its dispositions of 
underlying fund shares against its ordinary income (including distributions of 
any net short-term capital gain realized by an underlying fund). 
In addition, in certain 
circumstances, the “wash sale” rules under Section 1091 of the Code may 
apply to a Fund’s sales of underlying fund shares that have generated losses. A 
wash sale occurs if shares of an underlying fund are sold by the Fund at a loss 
and the Fund acquires substantially identical shares of that same underlying 
fund 30 days before or after the date of the sale. The wash-sale rules could 
defer losses in the Fund’s hands on sales of underlying fund shares (to the 
extent such sales are wash sales) for extended (and, in certain cases, 
potentially indefinite) periods of time. 
As a result of the foregoing rules, 
and certain other special rules, the amount of net investment income and net 
capital gain that each Fund will be required to distribute to shareholders may 
be greater than what such amounts would have been had the Fund directly invested 
in the securities held by the underlying funds, rather than investing in shares 
of the underlying funds. For similar reasons, the character of distributions 
from the Fund (e.g., long-term capital gain, exempt interest, eligibility for 
dividends-received deduction, etc.) will not necessarily be the same as it would 
have been had the Fund invested directly in the securities held by the 
underlying funds. 
If a Fund received dividends from an 
underlying fund that qualifies as a regulated investment company, and the 
underlying fund designates such dividends as “qualified dividend income”, then 
the Fund is permitted in turn to designate a portion of its distributions as 
“qualified dividend income”, provided the Fund meets holding period and other 
requirements with respect to shares of the underlying fund. 
Depending on a Fund’s percentage 
ownership in an underlying fund, both before and after a redemption, a 
redemption of shares of an underlying fund by a Fund may cause the Fund to be 
treated as receiving a Section 301 distribution taxable as a dividend under 
Section 307 of the Code, to the extent of its allocable shares of earnings and 
profits, on the full amount of the distribution instead of receiving capital 
gain income on the shares of the underlying fund. Such a distribution may be 
treated as qualified dividend income and thus eligible to be taxed at the rates 
applicable to long-term capital gain. If qualified dividend income treatment is 
not available, the distribution may be taxed as ordinary income. This could 
cause shareholders of the Fund to recognize higher amounts of ordinary income 
than if the shareholders had held the shares of the underlying funds directly. 

A Fund may elect to pass through to 
shareholders foreign tax credits from an underlying fund and exempt-interest 
dividends from an underlying fund, provided that at least 50% of the Fund’s 
total assets are invested in other regulated investment companies at the end of 
each quarter of the taxable year. 
Backup Withholding 
Each Fund generally is required to 
backup withhold and remit to the U.S. Treasury a percentage of the taxable 
dividends and other distributions paid to, and the proceeds of share sales, 
exchanges, or redemptions made by, any individual shareholder who fails to 
properly furnish the Fund with a correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), 
who has under-reported dividend or interest income, or who fails to certify to 
the Fund that he or she is not subject to backup withholding. The backup 
withholding rules may also apply to distributions that are properly designated 
as exempt-interest dividends. The backup withholding tax rate is 28%. 

Foreign Shareholders 
Shares of the Funds have not been 
registered for sale outside of the United States. This SAI is not intended for 
distribution to prospective investors outside of the United States. The Funds 
generally do not market or sell shares to investors domiciled outside of the 
United States, even, with regard to individuals, if they are citizens or lawful 
permanent residents of the United States. 
Distributions properly designated as 
Capital Gain Dividends and exempt-interest dividends generally will not be 
subject to withholding of federal income tax. However, exempt-interest dividends 
may be subject to backup 
 
Part II - 71 


withholding (as discussed above). In 
general, dividends other than Capital Gain Dividends and exempt-interest 
dividends paid by a Fund to a shareholder that is not a “U.S. person” within the 
meaning of the Code (a “foreign person”) are subject to withholding of U.S. 
federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) even if 
they are funded by income or gains (such as portfolio interest, short-term 
capital gains, or foreign-source dividend and interest income) that, if paid to 
a foreign person directly, would not be subject to withholding. However, the 
Fund will not be required to withhold any amounts (i) with respect to 
distributions (other than distributions to a foreign person (w) that has 
not provided a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. 
person, (x) to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain 
interest on an obligation if the foreign person is the issuer or is a 10% 
shareholder of the issuer, (y) that is within certain foreign countries 
that have inadequate information exchange with the United States, or (z) to 
the extent the dividend is attributable to interest paid by a person that is a 
related person of the foreign person and the foreign person is a controlled 
foreign corporation) from U.S.-source interest income of types similar to those 
not subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by an individual 
foreign person, to the extent such distributions are properly designated by the 
Fund (“interest-related dividends”), and (ii) with respect to distributions 
(other than (a) distributions to an individual foreign person who is 
present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or 
more during the year of the distribution and (b) distributions subject to 
special rules regarding the disposition of U.S. real property interests (as 
described below)) of net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term 
capital losses to the extent such distributions are properly designated by the 
Fund (“short-term capital gain dividends”). Depending on the circumstances, a 
Fund may make designations of interest-related and/or short-term capital gain 
dividends with respect to all, some or none of its potentially eligible 
dividends and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for 
these exemptions from withholding. In the case of shares held through an 
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund makes a designation 
with respect to a payment. Foreign persons should contact their intermediaries 
regarding the application of these rules to their accounts. 
A beneficial holder of shares who is 
a foreign person is not, in general, subject to U.S. federal income tax on gains 
(and is not allowed a deduction for losses) realized on the sale of shares of 
the Fund or on Capital Gain Dividends or exempt-interest dividends unless 
(i) such gain or dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a 
trade or business carried on by such holder within the United States or 
(ii) in the case of an individual holder, the holder is present in the 
United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the 
year of the sale or the receipt of the Capital Gain Dividend and certain other 
conditions are met or (iii) the shares constitute “U.S. real property 
interests” (“USRPIs”) or the Capital Gain Dividends are attributable to gains 
from the sale or exchange of USRPIs in accordance with the rules set forth 
below. 
Special rules apply to distributions 
to foreign shareholders from a Fund that is either a “U.S. real property holding 
corporation” (“USRPHC”) or would be a USRPHC but for the operation of the 
exceptions to the definition thereof described below. Additionally, special 
rules apply to the sale of shares in a Fund that is a USRPHC. Very generally, a 
USRPHC is a domestic corporation that holds U.S. real property interests 
(“USRPIs”) — USRPIs are defined as any interest in U.S. real property or any 
equity interest in a USRPHC — the fair market value of which equals or exceeds 
50% of the sum of the fair market values of the corporation’s USRPIs, interests 
in real property located outside the United States and certain other assets. A 
Fund that holds (directly or indirectly) significant interests in REITs may be a 
USRPHC. The special rules discussed in the next paragraph will also generally 
apply to distributions from a Fund that would be a USRPHC absent exclusions from 
USRPI treatment for interests in domestically controlled REITs or regulated 
investment companies and not-greater-than-5% interests in 
publicly traded classes of stock in REITs or regulated investment companies. 

In the case of a Fund that is a 
USRPHC or would be a USRPHC but for the exceptions from the definition of USRPI 
(described immediately above), distributions by the Fund that are attributable 
to (a) gains realized on the disposition of USRPIs by the Fund and 
(b) distributions received by the Fund from a lower-tier regulated 
investment company or REIT that the Fund is required to treat as USRPI gain in 
its hands will retain their character as gains realized from USRPIs in the hands 
of the Fund’s foreign shareholders. If the foreign shareholder holds (or has 
held in the prior year) more than a 5% interest in the Fund, such distributions 
will be treated as gains “effectively connected” with the conduct of a “U.S. 
trade or business,” and subject to tax at graduated rates. Moreover, such 
shareholders will be required to file a U.S. income tax return for the year in 
which the gain was recognized and the Fund will be required to withhold 35% of 
the amount of such distribution. In the case of all other foreign shareholders 
(i.e., those whose interest in the Fund did not exceed 5% at any time during the 
prior year), the USRPI distribution will be treated as ordinary income 
(regardless of any designation by the Fund that such distribution is a 
short-term capital gain dividend or a Capital Gain Dividend), and the Fund must 
withhold 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) of the amount of the 
distribution paid to such foreign shareholder. Foreign shareholders of a Fund 
are also subject to “wash sale” rules to prevent the avoidance of the tax-filing and -payment obligations discussed above through 
the sale and repurchase of Fund shares. 
 
Part II - 72 


In addition, a Fund that is a USRPHC 
must typically withhold 15% of the amount realized in a redemption by a greater-than-5% foreign shareholder, and that 
shareholder must file a U.S. income tax return for the year of the disposition 
of the USRPI and pay any additional tax due on the gain. No withholding is 
generally required with respect to amounts paid in redemption of shares of a 
Fund if the Fund is a domestically controlled USRPHC or, in certain limited 
cases, if the Fund (whether or not domestically controlled) holds substantial 
investments in regulated investment companies that are domestically controlled 
USRPHCs. 
In order to qualify for any 
exemptions from withholding described above or for lower withholding tax rates 
under income tax treaties, or to establish an exemption from backup withholding, 
the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing 
requirements relating to its non-US 
status (including, in general, furnishing an applicable IRS Form W-8 or substitute form). Foreign investors in 
a Fund should consult their tax advisers in this regard. 
If a shareholder is eligible for the 
benefits of a tax treaty, any effectively connected income or gain will 
generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis only if it is 
also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the shareholder in 
the United States. 
A beneficial holder of shares who is 
a foreign person may be subject to state and local tax and to the U.S. federal 
estate tax in addition to the federal tax on income referred to above. Foreign 
shareholders in a Fund should consult their tax advisors with respect to the 
potential application of the above rules. 
A Fund is required to withhold U.S. 
tax (at a 30% rate) on payments of taxable dividends and (effective 
January 1, 2019) redemption proceeds and certain capital gain dividends 
made to certain non-U.S. entities that 
fail to comply (or be deemed compliant) with extensive new reporting and 
withholding requirements designed to inform the U.S. Department of the Treasury 
of U.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Shareholders may be requested to 
provide additional information to a Fund to enable the Fund to determine whether 
withholding is required. 
Foreign Taxes 
Certain Funds may be subject to 
foreign withholding taxes or other foreign taxes with respect to income 
(possibly including, in some cases, capital gain) received from sources within 
foreign countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may 
reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of a Fund’s assets at year end 
consists of the securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may elect to permit 
shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for 
their pro rata portion of qualified taxes paid by the Fund to foreign countries 
in respect of foreign securities the Fund has held for at least the minimum 
period specified in the Code. In such a case, shareholders will include in gross 
income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes. A shareholder’s 
ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of foreign taxes 
paid by a Fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code and the 
Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, as a result of which a shareholder may 
not get a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes. In particular, 
shareholders must hold their Fund shares (without protection from risk of loss) 
on the ex-dividend date and for at 
least 15 additional days during the 30-day period surrounding the ex-dividend date to be eligible to claim a 
foreign tax credit with respect to a given dividend. Shareholders who do not 
itemize on their federal income tax returns may claim a credit (but no 
deduction) for such foreign taxes. 
If a Fund does not make the above 
election or if more than 50% of its assets at the end of the year do not consist 
of securities of foreign corporations, the Fund’s net income will be reduced by 
the foreign taxes paid or withheld. In such cases, shareholders will not be 
entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to foreign taxes. 

The foregoing is only a general 
description of the treatment of foreign source income or foreign taxes under the 
U.S. federal income tax laws. Because the availability of a credit or deduction 
depends on the particular circumstances of each shareholder, shareholders are 
advised to consult their own tax advisors. 
Exempt-Interest Dividends 
Some of the Funds intend to qualify 
to pay exempt-interest dividends to their respective shareholders. In order to 
qualify to pay exempt-interest dividends, at least 50% of the value of a Fund’s 
total assets must consist of tax-exempt 
municipal bonds at the close of each quarter of the Fund’s taxable year. An 
exempt-interest dividend is that part of a dividend that is properly designated 
as an exempt-interest dividend and that consists of interest received by a Fund 
on such tax-exempt securities. 
Shareholders of Funds that pay exempt-interest dividends would not incur any 
regular federal income tax on the amount of exempt-interest dividends received 
by them from a Fund, but an investment in such a Fund may result in liability 
for federal and state alternative minimum taxation and may be subject to state 
and local taxes. 
 
Part II - 73 


Interest on indebtedness incurred or 
continued by a shareholder, whether a corporation or an individual, to purchase 
or carry shares of a Fund is not deductible to the extent it relates to 
exempt-interest dividends received by the shareholder from that Fund. Any loss 
incurred on the sale or redemption of a Fund’s shares held for six months or 
less may be disallowed to the extent of exempt-interest dividends received with 
respect to such shares. 
Interest on certain tax-exempt bonds that are private activity 
bonds within the meaning of the Code is treated as a tax preference item for 
purposes of the alternative minimum tax, and any such interest received by a 
Fund and distributed to shareholders will be so treated for purposes of any 
alternative minimum tax liability of shareholders to the extent of the 
dividend’s proportionate share of a Fund’s income consisting of such interest. 
All exempt-interest dividends are subject to the corporate alternative minimum 
tax. 
The exemption from federal income 
tax for exempt-interest dividends does not necessarily result in exemption for 
such dividends under the income or other tax laws of any state or local 
authority. Shareholders that receive social security or railroad retirement 
benefits should consult their tax advisors to determine what effect, if any, an 
investment in a Fund may have on the federal taxation of their benefits. 

From time to time legislation may be 
introduced or litigation may arise that would change the tax treatment of 
exempt-interest dividends. Such legislation or litigation may have the effect of 
raising the state or other taxes payable by shareholders on such dividends. 
Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for the current federal, state 
and local law on exempt-interest dividends. 
State and Local Tax Matters 
Depending on the residence of the 
shareholders for tax purposes, distributions may also be subject to state and 
local taxation. Rules of state and local taxation regarding qualified dividend 
income, ordinary income dividends and capital gain dividends from regulated 
investment companies may differ from the rules of U.S. federal income tax in 
many respects. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the 
consequences of these and other state and local tax rules affecting investment 
in the Funds. 
Most states provide that a regulated 
investment company may pass through (without restriction) to its shareholders 
state and local income tax exemptions available to direct owners of certain 
types of U.S. government securities (such as U.S. Treasury obligations). Thus, 
for residents of these states, distributions derived from a Fund’s investment in 
certain types of U.S. government securities should be free from state and local 
income taxation to the extent that the interest income from such investments 
would have been exempt from state and local taxes if such securities had been 
held directly by the respective shareholders. Certain states, however, do not 
allow a regulated investment company to pass through to its shareholders the 
state and local income tax exemptions available to direct owners of certain 
types of U.S. government securities unless a Fund holds at least a required 
amount of U.S. government securities. Accordingly, for residents of these 
states, distributions derived from a Fund’s investment in certain types of U.S. 
government securities may not be entitled to the exemptions from state and local 
income taxes that would be available if the shareholders had purchased U.S. 
government securities directly. The exemption from state and local income taxes 
does not preclude states from asserting other taxes on the ownership of U.S. 
government securities. To the extent that a Fund invests to a substantial degree 
in U.S. government securities which are subject to favorable state and local tax 
treatment, shareholders of the Fund will be notified as to the extent to which 
distributions from the Fund are attributable to interest on such securities. 

Tax 
Shelter Reporting Regulations 
If a shareholder realizes a loss on 
disposition of a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual 
shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder 
must file with the Internal Revenue Service a disclosure statement on Form 8886. 
Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this 
reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a regulated 
investment company are not excepted. Future guidance may extend the current 
exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all 
regulated investment companies. The fact that a loss is reportable under these 
regulations does not affect the legal determination whether the taxpayer’s 
treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisers 
to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual 
circumstances. 
General Considerations 
The federal income tax discussion 
set forth above is for general information only. Prospective investors should 
consult their tax advisers regarding the specific federal tax consequences of 
purchasing, holding, and disposing of shares of each of the Funds, as well as 
the effects of state, local and foreign tax law and any proposed tax law 
changes.

(1)
A Fund Complex means two or more registered investment companies 
      that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of 
      investment and investor services or have a common investment adviser or 
      have an investment adviser that is an affiliated person of the investment 
      adviser of any of the other registered investment companies. The J.P. 
      Morgan Funds Complex for which the Board of Trustees serves currently 
      includes twelve registered investment companies (151 funds). 
  



*
Two members of the Board of Trustees of Northwestern University are 
      executive officers of registered investment advisers (not affiliated with 
      JPMorgan) that are under common control with sub-advisers to certain J.P. 
      Morgan Funds. 



**
In connection with prior employment with JPMorgan Chase, 
      Ms. Pardo was the recipient of non-qualified pension plan payments 
      from JPMorgan Chase in the amount of approximately $2,055 per month, which 
      she irrevocably waived effective January 1, 2013, and deferred 
      compensation payments from JPMorgan Chase in the amount of approximately 
      $7,294 per year, which ended in January 2013. In addition, 
      Ms. Pardo receives payments from a fully-funded qualified plan, which 
      is not an obligation of JPMorgan Chase. 
The Trustees serve for an indefinite 
term, subject to the Trusts’ current retirement policy, which is age 78 for all 
Trustees. The Board of Trustees decides upon general policies and is responsible 
for overseeing the business affairs of the Trusts. 
Qualifications of Trustees 
The Governance Committee and the 
Board considered the commitment that each Trustee has demonstrated in serving on 
the Board including the significant time each Trustee has devoted to preparing 
for meetings and the active engagement and participation of each Trustee at 
Board meetings. The Governance Committee and the Board also considered the 
character of each Trustee noting that each Trustee is committed to executing his 
or her duties as a trustee with diligence, honesty and integrity. The 
Governance Committee and the Board also considered the contributions that each 
Trustee has made to the Board in terms of experience, leadership, independence 
and the ability to work effectively and collaboratively with other Board 
members. 
The Governance Committee also 
considered the significant and relevant experience and knowledge that each 
Trustee has with respect to registered investment companies and asset 
management. The Governance Committee and the Board noted the additional 
experience that each of the Trustees has gained with respect to registered 
investment companies as a result of his or her service on the J.P. Morgan Funds 
Board. The J.P. Morgan Funds overseen by the J.P. Morgan Funds Board represent 
almost every asset class including (1) fixed income funds including 
traditional bond funds, municipal bond funds, high yield funds, government 
funds, and emerging markets debt funds, (2) money market funds, 
(3) international, emerging markets and country/region funds, 
(4) equity funds including small, mid and large capitalization funds and 
value and growth funds, (5) index funds, (6) funds of funds, including 
target date funds, and (7) specialty funds including market neutral funds, 
long/short funds and funds that invest in real estate securities and 
commodity-related securities and derivatives. The Governance Committee and the 
Board also considered the experience that each Trustee had with respect to 
reviewing agreements with the Funds’ service providers in connection with their 
broader service to the J.P. Morgan Funds including the Funds’ investment 
advisers, custodian, and fund accountant. 
The Governance Committee and the 
Board also considered the experience and contribution of each Trustee in the 
context of the Board’s leadership and committee structure. The Board has six 
committees including the Audit and Valuation Committee, the Compliance 
Committee, the Governance Committee, the Equity Committee, the Money Market and 
Alternative Products Committee, and a Fixed Income Committee. Different members 
of the Board serve on these three investment committees with respect to each 
asset type thereby allowing the J.P. Morgan Funds Board to effectively evaluate 
information for the Funds in the complex in a focused, disciplined manner. 

The Governance Committee also 
considered the operational efficiencies achieved by having a single Board for 
the Funds and the other registered investment companies overseen by the Advisers 
and its affiliates as well as the extensive experience of certain Trustees 
in serving on Boards for registered investment companies advised by subsidiaries 
or affiliates of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and/or Bank One Corporation 
(known as “heritage J.P. Morgan Funds” or “heritage One Group Mutual 
Funds”).

Board Leadership Structure and Oversight 

The Board has structured itself in a 
manner that allows it to effectively perform its oversight function. The 
Chairman of the Board is an independent Trustee, which allows him to carry out 
his leadership duties as Chairman with objectivity. 
 
Part II - 80 


The Board has adopted a committee 
structure that allows it to effectively perform its oversight function for all 
of the Funds in the complex. As described under “Qualifications of Trustees” and 
“Standing Committees,” the Board has six committees: the Audit and Valuation 
Committee, the Compliance Committee, the Governance Committee, the Equity 
Committee, the Fixed Income Committee and the Money Market and Alternative 
Products Committee. The Board has determined that the leadership and committee 
structure is appropriate for the Funds and allows the Board to effectively and 
efficiently evaluate issues that impact the Funds as a whole as well as issues 
that are unique to each Fund. 
The Board and the Committees take an 
active role in risk oversight including the risks associated with registered 
investment companies including investment risk, compliance and valuation. The 
Governance Committee oversees and reports to the Board on the risk management 
processes for the Funds. In addition, in connection with its oversight, the 
Board receives regular reports from the Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), the 
Advisers, the Administrator, and the internal audit department of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. The Board also receives periodic reports from the Chief 
Risk Officer of Investment Management Americas and Alternatives of J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management1 (“JPMAM”) including reports 
concerning operational controls that are designed to address market risk, credit 
risk, and liquidity risk among others. The Board also receives regular reports 
from personnel responsible for JPMAM’s business resiliency and disaster 
recovery. 
In addition, the Board and its 
Committees work on an ongoing basis in fulfilling the oversight function. At 
each quarterly meeting, each of the Equity Committee, the Fixed Income 
Committee, and the Money Market and Alternative Products Committee meets with 
representatives of the Advisers as well as an independent consultant to review 
and evaluate the ongoing performance of the Funds. Each of these three 
Committees reports these reviews to the full Board. The Audit and Valuation 
Committee is responsible for oversight of the performance of the Fund’s audit, 
accounting and financial reporting policies, practices and internal controls and 
valuation policies, assisting the Board in its oversight of the valuation of the 
Funds’ securities by the Advisers, overseeing the quality and objectivity of the 
Funds’ independent audit and the financial statements of the Funds, and acting 
as a liaison between the Funds’ independent registered public accounting firm 
and the full Board. The Compliance Committee is responsible for oversight of the 
Funds’ compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and 
compliance with policy and procedures. The Governance Committee is responsible 
for, among other things, oversight of matters relating to the Funds’ corporate 
governance obligations and risk management processes, Fund service providers and 
litigation. At each quarterly meeting, each of the Governance Committee, the 
Audit and Valuation Committee and the Compliance Committee report their 
committee proceedings to the full Board. This Committee structure allows the 
Board to efficiently evaluate a large amount of material and effectively fulfill 
its oversight function. Annually, the Board considers the efficiency of this 
committee structure. 
Additional information about each of 
the Committees is included below in “Standing Committees.”

Audit and Valuation Committee. 
The purposes of the Audit and Valuation Committee are to: 
(i) appoint and determine compensation of the Funds’ independent 
accountants; (ii) evaluate the independence of the Funds’ independent 
accountants; (iii) oversee the performance of the Funds’ audit, accounting 
and financial reporting policies, practices and internal controls and valuation 
policies; (iv) approve non-audit 
services, as required by the statutes and regulations administered by the SEC, 
including the 1940 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; (v) assist the 
Board in its oversight of the valuation of the Funds’ securities by the Adviser, 
as well as any sub-adviser; 
(vi) oversee the quality and objectivity of the Funds’ independent audit 
and the financial statements of the Funds; and (vii) act as a liaison 
between the Funds’ independent registered public accounting firm and the full 
Board. The Audit and Valuation Committee has delegated valuation 
responsibilities to any member of the Committee to respond to inquiries on 
valuation matters and participate in fair valuation determinations when the 
Funds’ valuation procedures require Board action, but it is impracticable or 
impossible to hold a meeting of the entire Board. Prior to November 18, 
2009, the Board of each Trust (other than JPMT III) delegated these valuation 
responsibilities to a Valuation Sub-Committee of the Audit Committee. JPMT 
III was organized on November 14, 2013. 
Compliance Committee. 
The primary purposes of the Compliance Committee are to (i) oversee 
the Funds’ compliance with legal and regulatory and contractual requirements and 
the Funds’ compliance policies and procedures; and (ii) consider the 
appointment, compensation and removal of the Funds’ Chief Compliance Officer. 

Governance Committee. 
The members of the Governance Committee are each Independent Trustees of 
the J.P. Morgan Funds. The duties of the Governance Committee include, but are 
not limited to, (i) selection and nomination of persons for election or 
appointment as Trustees; (ii) periodic review of the compensation payable 
to the non-interested Trustees; 
(iii) establishment of non-interested Trustee expense policies; 
(iv) periodic review and evaluation of the functioning of the Board and its 
committees; (v) with respect to the JPMT II Funds, appointment and removal 
of the Funds’ Senior Officer, and approval of compensation for the Funds’ Senior 
Officer and retention and compensation of the Senior Officer’s staff and 
consultants; (vi) selection of independent legal counsel to the non-interested Trustees and legal counsel to 
the Funds; (vii) oversight of ongoing litigation affecting the Funds, the 

 
Part II - 82 


Adviser or the non-interested Trustees; 
(viii) oversight of regulatory issues or deficiencies affecting the Funds 
(except financial matters considered by the Audit Committee); 
(ix) oversight of the risk management processes for Funds; and 
(x) oversight and review of matters with respect to service providers to 
the Funds (except the Funds’ independent registered public accounting firm). 
When evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as an Independent 
Trustee, the Governance Committee may consider, among other factors, 
(i) whether or not the person is “independent” and whether the person is 
otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a Trustee; 
(ii) whether or not the person is willing to serve, and willing and able to 
commit the time necessary for the performance of the duties of an Independent 
Trustee; (iii) the contribution that the person can make to the Board and 
the J.P. Morgan Funds, with consideration being given to the person’s business 
experience, education and such other factors as the Committee may consider 
relevant; (iv) the character and integrity of the person; (v) the 
desirable personality traits, including independence, leadership and the ability 
to work with the other members of the Board; and (vi) to the extent 
consistent with the 1940 Act, such recommendations from management as are deemed 
appropriate. The process of identifying nominees involves the consideration of 
candidates recommended by one or more of the following: current Independent 
Trustees, officers, shareholders and other sources that the Governance Committee 
deems appropriate. The Governance Committee will review nominees recommended to 
the Board by shareholders and will evaluate such nominees in the same manner as 
it evaluates nominees identified by the Governance Committee. Nominee 
recommendations may be submitted to the Secretary of the Trusts at each Trust’s 
principal business address. 
Equity Committee, Fixed Income 
Committee and Money Market and Alternative Products Committee.
Each member of the Board, other than Dr. Goldstein, serves on one of 
the following committees: the Equity Committee, the Fixed Income Committee and 
Money Market and Alternative Products Committee. These three Committees are 
divided by asset type and different members of the Board serve on each committee 
with respect to each asset type. The function of the Committees is to assist the 
Board in the oversight of the investment management services provided by the 
Adviser to the Funds, as well as any sub-adviser to the Funds. The primary purpose 
of each Committee is to (i) assist the Board in its oversight of the 
investment management services provided by the Adviser to the Funds designated 
for review by each Committee; and (ii) review and make recommendations to 
the Board concerning the approval of proposed new or continued advisory and 
distribution arrangements for the Funds or for new funds. The full Board may 
delegate to the applicable Committee from time to time the authority to make 
Board level decisions on an interim basis when it is impractical to convene a 
meeting of the full Board. Each of the Committees receives reports concerning 
investment management topics, concerns or exceptions with respect to particular 
Funds that the Committee is assigned to oversee, and work to facilitate the 
understanding by the Board of particular issues related to investment management 
of Funds reviewed by the applicable Committee. 
For details of the number of 
times each of the four standing committees met during the most recent fiscal 
year, see “TRUSTEES — Standing Committees” in Part I of this SAI. 

For details of the dollar range 
of equity securities owned by each Trustee in the Funds, see “TRUSTEES — 
Ownership of Securities” in Part I of this SAI. 
Trustee Compensation 
The Trustees instituted a Deferred 
Compensation Plan for Eligible Trustees (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) 
pursuant to which the Trustees are permitted to defer part or all of their 
compensation. Amounts deferred are deemed invested in shares of one or more 
series of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III, JPMT IV, Undiscovered Managers Funds, 
JPMFMFG, and JPMMFIT, as selected by the Trustee from time to time, to be used 
to measure the performance of a Trustee’s deferred compensation account. Amounts 
deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan will be deemed to be invested in 
Select Class Shares of the identified funds, unless Select Class Shares are not 
available, in which case the amounts will be deemed to be invested in 
Class A Shares. A Trustee’s deferred compensation account will be paid at 
such times as elected by the Trustee, subject to certain mandatory payment 
provisions in the Deferred Compensation Plan (e.g., death of a Trustee). 
Deferral and payment elections under the Deferred Compensation Plan are subject 
to strict requirements for modification. 
Each Declaration of Trust provides 
that the Trust will indemnify its Trustees and officers against liabilities and 
expenses incurred in connection with litigation in which they may be involved 
because of their offices with the Trust, unless, as to liability to the Trust or 
its shareholders, it is finally adjudicated that they engaged in willful 
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties 
involved in their offices or with respect to any matter unless it is finally 
adjudicated that they did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that 
their actions were in the best interest of the Trust. In the case of settlement, 
such indemnification will not be provided 
 
Part II - 83 


unless it has been determined by a 
court or other body approving the settlement or disposition, or by a reasonable 
determination based upon a review of readily available facts, by vote of a 
majority of disinterested Trustees or in a written opinion of independent 
counsel, that such officers or Trustees have not engaged in willful misfeasance, 
bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties. 
For details of Trustee 
compensation paid by the Funds, including deferred compensation, see “TRUSTEES — 
Trustee Compensation” in Part I of this SAI.

Part II - 85 


JPMIM is a registered investment 
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. JPMIM is located 
at 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017. 
Under the JPMIM Advisory Agreements, 
JPMIM provides investment advisory services to certain Funds, which include 
managing the purchase, retention and disposition of such Funds’ investments. 
JPMIM may delegate its responsibilities to a sub-adviser. Any subadvisory agreements must 
be approved by the applicable Trust’s Board of Trustees and the applicable 
Fund’s shareholders, to the extent required by the 1940 Act. 
Under separate agreements, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, JPMIM and JPMorgan Distribution Services, Inc. (“JPMDS”) provide 
certain custodial, fund accounting, recordkeeping and administrative services to 
the Trusts and the Funds and shareholder services for the Trusts. JPMDS is the 
shareholder servicing agent and the distributor for certain Funds. JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, JPMIM and JPMDS are each subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase and 
affiliates of the Advisers. See the “Custodian,” “Administrator,” “Shareholder 
Servicing” and “Distributor” sections. 
Under the terms of the JPMIM 
Advisory Agreements, the investment advisory services JPMIM provides to certain 
Funds are not exclusive. JPMIM is free to and does render similar investment 
advisory services to others. JPMIM serves as investment adviser to personal 
investors and other investment companies and acts as fiduciary for trusts, 
estates and employee benefit plans. Certain of the assets of trusts and estates 
under management are invested in common trust funds for which JPMIM serves as 
trustee. The accounts which are managed or advised by JPMIM have varying 
investment objectives, and JPMIM invests assets of such accounts in investments 
substantially similar to, or the same as, those which are expected to constitute 
the principal investments of certain Funds. Such accounts are supervised by 
employees of JPMIM who may also be acting in similar capacities for the Funds. 
See “Portfolio Transactions.” 
The Funds are managed by employees 
of JPMIM who, in acting for their customers, including the Funds, do not discuss 
their investment decisions with any personnel of JPMorgan Chase or any personnel 
of other divisions of JPMIM or with any of their affiliated persons, with the 
exception of certain other investment management affiliates of JPMorgan Chase 
which execute transactions on behalf of the Funds. 
As compensation for the services 
rendered and related expenses, such as salaries of advisory personnel borne by 
JPMIM or a predecessor, under the JPMIM Advisory Agreements, the applicable 
Trusts, on behalf of the Funds, have agreed to pay JPMIM a fee, which is 
computed daily and may be paid monthly, equal to the annual rate of each Fund’s 
average daily net assets as described in the applicable Prospectuses. 

The JPMIM Advisory Agreements 
continue in effect for annual periods beyond October 31 of each year only 
if specifically approved thereafter annually in the same manner as the 
Distribution Agreement; except that for new funds, the initial approval will 
continue for up to two years, after which annual approvals are required. See the 
“Distributor” section. The JPMIM Advisory Agreements will terminate 
automatically if assigned and are terminable at any time without penalty by a 
vote of a majority of the Trustees, or by a vote of the holders of a majority of 
a Fund’s outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act), on 60 days’ 
written notice to JPMIM and by JPMIM on 90 days’ written notice to the Trusts 
(60 days with respect to the International Research Enhanced Equity Fund, Mid 
Cap Value Fund and Growth Advantage Fund). The continuation of the JPMIM 
Advisory Agreements was last approved by the Board of Trustees at its meeting in 
August 2016. 
The JPMIM Advisory Agreements 
provide that the Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or 
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Trust in connection with the 
performance of the respective investment advisory agreement, except a loss 
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence on the part 
of the Adviser in the performance of its duties, or from reckless disregard by 
it of its duties and obligations thereunder, or, with respect to all such Funds 
except the Mid Cap Value Fund, a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty 
with respect to the receipt of compensation for services. 
Prior to January 1, 2010, JPMIA 
served as investment adviser to certain JPMT II Funds pursuant to the Amended 
and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement between JPMIA and JPMT II dated 
August 12, 2004 (the “JPMT II Advisory Agreement”). On July 1, 2004, 
Bank One Corporation, the former indirect corporate parent of JPMIA, merged into 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (now officially known as JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.). On that date, JPMIA became an indirect, wholly-owned 
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase. JPMIA is a registered investment adviser under the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Effective January 1, 2010 (the 
“Effective Date”), the investment advisory business of JPMIA was transferred to 
JPMIM and JPMIM became the investment adviser for the applicable Funds under the 
JPMT II Advisory Agreement. The appointment of JPMIM did not change the 
portfolio management team, the investment strategies, the investment advisory 
fees charged to the Funds or the 
 
Part II - 86 


terms of the JPMT II Advisory 
Agreement (other than the identity of the investment adviser). Shareholder 
approval was not required for the replacement of JPMIA by JPMIM. 
Subject to the supervision of a 
Trust’s Board of Trustees, JPMIM provides or will cause to be provided a 
continuous investment program for certain Funds, including investment research 
and management with respect to all securities and investments and cash 
equivalents in those Funds. JPMIM may delegate its responsibilities to a sub-adviser. Any subadvisory agreements must 
be approved by the Trust’s Board of Trustees and the applicable Funds’ 
shareholders, to the extent required by the 1940 Act. 
The JPMT II Advisory Agreement 
continues in effect for annual periods beyond October 31 of each year, if 
such continuance is approved at least annually by the Trust’s Board of Trustees 
or by vote of a majority of the outstanding Shares of such Fund (as defined 
under “Additional Information” in this SAI), and a majority of the Trustees who 
are not parties to the respective investment advisory agreements or interested 
persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any party to the respective investment 
advisory agreements by votes cast in person at a meeting called for such 
purpose. The continuation of the JPMT II Advisory Agreement was approved by the 
Trust’s Board of Trustees at its meeting held in August 2016. 
The JPMT II Advisory Agreement may 
be terminated as to a particular Fund at any time on 60 days’ written notice 
without penalty by the Trustees, by vote of a majority of the outstanding Shares 
of that Fund, or by the Fund’s Adviser as the case may be. The JPMIA Advisory 
Agreement also terminates automatically in the event of any assignment, as 
defined in the 1940 Act. 
As compensation for the services 
rendered and related expenses, such as salaries of advisory personnel borne by 
JPMIM, under the JPMT II Advisory Agreement, the applicable Trusts, on behalf of 
the Funds, have agreed to pay JPMIM a fee, which is computed daily and may be 
paid monthly, equal to the annual rate of each Fund’s average daily net assets 
as described in the applicable Prospectuses. 
The JPMT II Advisory Agreement 
provides that the Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or 
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Trust in connection with the 
performance of the respective investment advisory agreement, except a loss 
resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of 
compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence on the part of the Adviser in the performance of its 
duties, or from reckless disregard by it of its duties and obligations 
thereunder. 
Security Capital Research & Management 
Incorporated (“SCR&M”). SCR&M serves as investment adviser to the 
U.S. Core Real Estate Securities Fund pursuant to an agreement with JPMT I, on 
behalf of the U.S. Core Real Estate Securities Fund (the “Core Real Estate 
Securities Fund Investment Advisory Agreement”). SCR&M was formed in January 
1995 to provide investment advisory services related to real estate assets to 
various clients. SCR&M is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan 
Asset Management Holdings Inc. 
SCR&M makes the investment 
decisions for the assets of the U.S. Core Real Estate Securities Fund. SCR&M 
also reviews, supervises and administers each such Fund’s investment program, 
subject to the supervision of, and policies established by, the Trustees. 
SCR&M is located at 10 South Dearborn Street, Suite 1400, Chicago, 
IL 60603. 
The Core Real Estate Securities Fund 
Investment Advisory Agreement provides that it will continue in effect for 
successive twelve month periods beyond October 31 of each year if not terminated 
or approved at least annually by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. The Core Real 
Estate Securities Fund Investment Advisory Agreement was initially approved by 
the Trust’s Board of Trustees at their quarterly meeting on May 17, 2011 and may 
be terminated as to the U.S. Core Real Estate Securities Fund at any time on 60 
days’ written notice without penalty by the Trustees, by vote of a majority of 
the outstanding Shares of that Fund, or by the Fund’s Adviser. The Core Real 
Estate Securities Fund Investment Advisory Agreement also terminates 
automatically in the event of any assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act. 

The Core Real Estate Securities Fund 
Investment Advisory Agreement provides that the Adviser shall not be liable for 
any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the 
respective Trust in connection with the performance under the agreement, except 
a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of 
compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad 
faith, or gross negligence on the part of the Adviser in the performance of its 
duties, or from reckless disregard by it of its duties and obligations 
thereunder. 
J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc 
(“JPMAAM”). JPMAAM serves as investment adviser to the Multi-Manager

and JPMT III (the “JPMAAM Advisory Agreement”). 
 
 
Part II - 87 


JPMAAM is a registered investment 
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. JPMAAM is located 
at 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017. 
Under the terms of the JPMAAM 
Advisory Agreement, the investment advisory services JPMAAM provides to the 
Multi-Manager Alternatives Fund is not exclusive. JPMAAM is free to and does 
render similar investment advisory services to others. JPMAAM serves as 
investment adviser to other pooled investment vehicles The accounts which are 
managed or advised by JPMAAM have varying investment objectives, and JPMAAM 
invests or allocates assets of such accounts in investments or to sub-advisers 
who employ investment strategies substantially similar to, or the same as, those 
which are expected to constitute the principal strategies of certain Funds. Such 
accounts are supervised by employees of JPMAAM who may also be acting in similar 
capacities for the Funds. See “Portfolio Transactions.” 
As compensation for the services 
rendered and related expenses, such as salaries of advisory personnel borne by 
JPMAAM, under the JPMAAM Advisory Agreement, JPMT III, on behalf of the 
Multi-Manager Alternatives Fund, has agreed to pay JPMAAM a fee, which is 
computed daily and may be paid monthly, equal to the annual rate of each Fund’s 
average daily net assets as described in the applicable Prospectuses. 

The JPMAAM Advisory Agreement 
continues in effect for annual periods beyond October 31 of each year only if 
specifically approved thereafter annually in the same manner as the Distribution 
Agreement; except that for new funds, the initial approval will continue for up 
to two years, after which annual approvals are required. See the “Distributor” 
section. The JPMAAM Advisory Agreement will terminate automatically if assigned 
and is terminable at any time without penalty by a vote of a majority of the 
Trustees, or by a vote of the holders of a majority of a Fund’s outstanding 
voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act), on 60 days’ written notice to 
JPMAAM and by JPMAAM on 90 days’ written notice to the Trusts. The JPMAAM 
Advisory Agreement was approved by the Board of Trustees at its meeting in 
August 2016. 
The JPMAAM Advisory Agreement 
provides that the Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or 
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Trust in connection with the 
performance of the respective investment advisory agreement, except a loss 
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence on the part 
of the Adviser in the performance of its duties, or from reckless disregard by 
it of its duties and obligations thereunder, or, with respect to all such Funds, 
a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of 
compensation for services. 
Subject to the supervision of a 
Trust’s Board of Trustees, JPMAAM provides or will cause to be provided a 
continuous investment program for Multi-Manager Alternatives Fund. JPMAAM may 
delegate its responsibilities to sub-advisers. Any subadvisory agreements must 
be approved by the Trust’s Board of Trustees and the applicable Funds’ 
shareholders, as required by the 1940 Act. 
JF 
International Management Inc. (“JFIMI”). JPMIM has entered into two 
investment sub-advisory agreements with 
JFIMI, one agreement with respect to the China Region Fund and one with respect 
to the International Discovery Fund (the “JFIMI Sub-Advisory Agreements”) pursuant to which 
JFIMI serves as investment sub-adviser 
to such Funds. JFIMI is registered as a registered investment adviser under the 
Investment Advisers Act and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. 
JFIMI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
J.P. Morgan Asset Management (Asia) Inc., which is wholly-owned by JPMorgan 
Asset Management Holdings Inc. (“JPMAMH”). JFIMI is located at 21F, Charter 
House, 8 Connaught Road, Central Hong Kong. 
JFIMI may, in its discretion, 
provide such services through its own employees or the employees of one or more 
affiliated companies that are qualified to act as an investment adviser to a 
Fund under applicable laws and that are under the common control of JPMIM; 
provided that (i) all persons, when providing services under the JFIMI 
Sub-Advisory Agreements, are 
functioning as part of an organized group of persons, and (ii) such 
organized group of persons is managed at all times by authorized officers of 
JFIMI. This arrangement will not result in the payment of additional fees by a 
Fund. 
Pursuant to the terms of the 
applicable JPMIM Advisory Agreement and the JFIMI Sub-Advisory Agreements, the Adviser and 
Sub-Adviser are permitted to render 
services to others. Each such agreement is terminable without penalty by the 
applicable Trusts, on behalf of the Funds, on not more than 60 days’, nor less 
than 30 days’, written notice when authorized either by a majority vote of a 
Fund’s shareholders or by a vote of a majority of the Boards of Trustees of the 
Trusts, or by JPMIM or JFIMI on not more than 60 days’, nor less than 30 days’, 
written notice, and will automatically terminate in the event of its 
“assignment” (as defined in the 1940 Act). The applicable JPMIM Advisory 
Agreement provides that JPMIM or JFIMI shall not be liable for any error of 
judgment or mistake of law or for any loss arising out of any investment or for 
any act or omission in the execution of portfolio transactions for 
 
Part II - 88 


a Fund, except for willful 
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or 
by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties thereunder. 

As compensation for the services 
rendered and related expenses borne by JFIMI, under the applicable JFIMI 
Sub-Advisory Agreement. JPMIM has agreed to pay JFIMI a fee, which is computed 
daily and may be paid monthly, at the rate of 0.48% per annum on the average 
daily net asset value of the assets of the China Region Fund and at the rate of 
0.60% per annum on the average daily net asset value of the assets of the 
International Discovery Fund managed by JFIMI. 
The JFIMI Sub-Advisory Agreements 
applicable to the China Region Fund and the International Discovery Fund provide 
that they will continue in effect for an initial two year period and shall 
continue in effect thereafter only as long as such continuance is specifically 
approved at least annually in conformity with the requirements of the 1940 Act. 

Each JFIMI Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that the 
Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any 
error of judgment or for any loss suffered by the Trust in connection with the 
performance under the agreement, except a loss resulting from willful 
misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence on the part of the Sub-Adviser in the performance of its duties, 
or from reckless disregard by it of its duties and obligations thereunder. 

J.P. 
Morgan Private Investments, Inc. (“JPMPI”). JPMPI has been engaged by JPMIM 
to serve as investment sub-adviser to 
the JPMorgan Access Balanced Fund and JPMorgan Access Growth Fund (the “JPMPI 
Sub-Advisory Agreement”). JPMPI is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMPI is located at 270 
Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017. 
JPMPI is paid monthly by JPMIM a fee 
equal to a percentage of the average daily net assets of the JPMorgan Access 
Balanced Fund and JPMorgan Access Growth Fund. The aggregate annual rate of the 
fees payable by JPMIM to JPMPI is 0.95% of the portion of each of the JPMorgan 
Access Balanced Fund’s and JPMorgan Access Growth Fund’s average daily net 
assets managed by JPMPI. 
The JPMPI Sub-Advisory Agreement will continue in 
effect for a period of two years from the date of its execution, unless 
terminated sooner. It may be renewed from year to year thereafter, so long as 
continuance is specifically approved at least annually in accordance with the 
requirements of the 1940 Act. 
The JPMPI Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that it will 
terminate in the event of an “assignment” (as defined in the 1940 Act), and may 
be terminated without penalty at any time by either party upon 60 days’ written 
notice, or upon termination of the JPMIM Advisory Agreement. Under the terms of 
the JPMPI Sub-Advisory Agreement, JPMPI 
is not liable to JPMIM, the JPMorgan Access Balanced Fund or the JPMorgan Access 
Growth Fund, or their shareholders, for any error of judgment or mistake of law 
or for any losses sustained by JPMIM, the JPMorgan Access Balanced Fund or the 
JPMorgan Access Growth Fund or their shareholders, except in the case of JPMPI’s 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of 
obligations or duties under the JPMPI Sub-Advisory Agreement. 
 
Part II - 89 


POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
JPMIM1

JPMIM and/or its affiliates (the 
“Affiliates” and, together, “JPMorgan”) provide an array of discretionary and 
non-discretionary investment management services and products to institutional 
clients and individual investors. In addition, JPMorgan is a diversified 
financial services firm that provides a broad range of services and products to 
its clients and is a major participant in the global currency, equity, 
commodity, fixed-income and other markets in which a Fund invests or will 
invest. Investors should carefully review the following, which describes 
potential and actual conflicts of interest that JPMorgan can face in the 
operation of its investment management services. JPMorgan and the Funds have 
adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to appropriately prevent, 
limit or mitigate the conflicts of interest described below. In addition, many 
of the activities that create these conflicts of interest are limited and/or 
prohibited by law, unless an exception is available. 
This section is not, and is not 
intended to be, a complete enumeration or explanation of all of the potential 
conflicts of interest that may arise. Additional information about potential 
conflicts of interest regarding JPMIM and JPMorgan is set forth in JPMIM’s Form 
ADV. A copy of Part 1 and Part 2A of JPMIM’s and each other Adviser’s or 
Sub-Adviser’s Form ADV is available on the SEC’s website 
(www.adviserinfo.sec.gov). 
Acting for Multiple Clients. 
In general, JPMIM faces conflicts of interest when it renders investment 
advisory services to several clients and, from time to time, provides dissimilar 
investment advice to different clients. For example, when funds or accounts 
managed by JPMIM (“Other Accounts”) engage in short sales of the same securities 
held by a Fund, JPMIM could be seen as harming the performance of a Fund for the 
benefit of the Other Accounts engaging in short sales, if the short sales cause 
the market value of the securities to fall. In addition, a conflict could arise 
when one or more Other Accounts invest in different instruments or classes of 
securities of the same issuer than those in which a Fund invests. In certain 
circumstances, Other Accounts have different investment objectives or could 
pursue or enforce rights with respect to a particular issuer in which a Fund has 
also invested and these activities could have an adverse effect on the Fund. For 
example, if a Fund holds debt instruments of an issuer and an Other Account 
holds equity securities of the same issuer, then if the issuer experiences 
financial or operational challenges, the Fund (which holds the debt instrument) 
may seek a liquidation of the issuer, whereas the Other Account (which holds the 
equity securities) may prefer a reorganization of the issuer. In addition, an 
issuer in which the Fund invests may use the proceeds of the Fund’s investment 
to refinance or reorganize its capital structure which could result in repayment 
of debt held by JPMorgan or an Other Account. If the issuer performs poorly 
following such refinancing or reorganization, the Fund’s results will suffer 
whereas the Other Account’s performance will not be affected because the Other 
Account no longer has an investment in the issuer. Conflicts are magnified with 
respect to issuers that become insolvent. It is possible that in connection with 
an insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or similar proceeding, a Fund will be 
limited (by applicable law, courts or otherwise) in the positions or actions it 
will be permitted to take due to other interests held or actions or positions 
taken by JPMorgan or Other Accounts. 
Positions taken by Other Accounts 
may also dilute or otherwise negatively affect the values, prices or investment 
strategies associated with positions held by a Fund. For example, this may occur 
when investment decisions for the Fund are based on research or other 
information that is also used to support portfolio decisions by JPMIM for Other 
Accounts following different investment strategies or by Affiliates in managing 
their clients’ accounts. When an Other Account or an account managed by an 
Affiliate implements a portfolio decision or strategy ahead of, or 
contemporaneously with, similar portfolio decisions or strategies for a Fund 
(whether or not the portfolio decisions emanate from the same research analysis 
or other information), market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors 
could result in the Fund receiving less favorable investment results, and the 
costs of implementing such portfolio decisions or strategies could be increased 
or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. 
Investment opportunities that are 
appropriate for a Fund may also be appropriate for Other Accounts and there is 
no assurance the Fund will receive an allocation of all or a portion of those 
investments it wishes to pursue. JPMIM’s management of an Other Account that 
pays it a performance fee or a higher management fee and follows the same or 
similar strategy as a Fund or invests in substantially similar assets as a Fund, 
creates an incentive for JPMIM to favor the account paying it the potentially 
higher fee, e.g., in placing securities trades.

The 
      affiliates of JPMIM that act as Adviser or Sub-Adviser to a Fund – 
      Security Capital Research & Management Incorporated, J.P. Morgan 
      Alternative Asset Management, Inc., JF International Management, Inc. and 
      J.P. Morgan Private Investments Inc.—will also face some or all of the 
      conflicts of interest described in this section. References to JPMIM 
      should be read to apply to these other advisers for a Fund advised or 
      sub-advised by such other adviser. 
 
Part II - 90 


JPMIM and its Affiliates, and any of 
their directors, officers or employees, also buy, sell, or trade securities for 
their own accounts or the proprietary accounts of JPMIM and/or an Affiliate. 
JPMIM or its Affiliates, within their discretion, may make different investment 
decisions and take other actions with respect to their own proprietary accounts 
than those made for client accounts, including the timing or nature of such 
investment decisions or actions. Further, JPMIM is not required to purchase or 
sell for any client account securities that it, an Affiliate or any of its or 
their employees may purchase or sell for their own accounts or the proprietary 
accounts of JPMIM or an Affiliate or its clients. JPMIM, its Affiliates and 
their respective directors, officers and employees face a conflict of interest 
as they will have income or other incentives to favor their own accounts or 
proprietary accounts. 
The portfolio managers of certain 
Funds-of-Funds have access to the holdings and may have knowledge of the 
investment strategies and techniques of certain underlying Funds because they 
are portfolio managers of separately managed accounts following similar 
strategies as a Fund-of-Funds. They therefore face conflicts of interest in the 
timing and amount of allocations to an underlying Fund, as well as in the choice 
of an underlying fund. JPMorgan also faces conflicts of interest when waiving 
certain fees if those waivers enhance performance. 
The chart in Part I of this SAI 
entitled “Portfolio Managers’ Other Accounts Managed” shows the number, type and 
market value as of a specified date of the accounts and other Funds managed by 
each Fund’s (excluding the Money Market Funds’) portfolio managers. 
Acting in Multiple Commercial 
Capacities. JPMorgan is a diversified financial services firm that provides 
a broad range of services and products to its clients and is a major participant 
in the global currency, equity, commodity, fixed-income and other markets in 
which a Fund invests or may invest. JPMorgan is typically entitled to 
compensation in connection with these activities and the Funds will not be 
entitled to any such compensation. In providing services and products to clients 
other than the Funds, JPMorgan, from time to time, faces conflicts of interest 
with respect to activities recommended to or performed for a Fund on one hand 
and for JPMorgan’s other clients on the other hand. For example, JPMorgan has, 
and continues to seek to develop, banking and other financial and advisory 
relationships with numerous U.S. and non-U.S. persons and governments. JPMorgan 
also advises and represents potential buyers and sellers of businesses 
worldwide. The Funds have invested in, or may wish to invest in, such entities 
represented by JPMorgan or with which JPMorgan has a banking or other financial 
relationship. In addition, certain clients of JPMorgan may invest in entities in 
which JPMorgan holds an interest, including a Fund. In providing services to its 
clients, JPMorgan from time to time recommends activities that compete with or 
otherwise adversely affect a Fund or the Fund’s investments. It should be 
recognized that such relationships may also preclude the Fund from engaging in 
certain transactions and may constrain the Fund’s investment flexibility. For 
example, Affiliates that are broker dealers cannot deal with the Funds as 
principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless an exemptive order 
allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Certain of the Funds have 
received exemptive orders permitting the Funds to engage in principal 
transactions with Affiliates involving taxable and tax exempt money market 
instruments. However, for the purchase and sale of longer term fixed income 
securities, which are generally principal transactions, the Funds cannot use 
broker dealer Affiliates. Or, if an Affiliate is the sole underwriter of an 
initial or secondary offering, the Funds could not purchase in the offering. In 
both cases the number of securities and counterparties available to the Funds 
will be fewer than are available to mutual funds that are not affiliated with 
major broker dealers. 
JPMorgan derives ancillary benefits 
from providing investment advisory, custody, administration, fund accounting and 
shareholder servicing and other services to the Funds, and providing such 
services to the Funds may enhance JPMorgan’s relationships with various parties, 
facilitate additional business development and enable JPMorgan to obtain 
additional business and generate additional revenue. 
Participations Adverse to the 
Funds. JPMorgan’s participation in certain markets or its actions for 
certain clients may also restrict or affect a Fund’s ability to transact in 
those markets and JPMorgan may face conflicts with respect to the interests 
involved. For example, when a Fund and another JPMorgan client invest in 
different parts of an issuer’s capital structure, decisions over whether to 
trigger an event of default, over the terms of any workout, or how to exit an 
investment implicate conflicts of interest. See also “Acting for Multiple 
Clients”. 
Preferential Treatment. JPMIM 
receives more compensation with respect to certain Funds or Other Accounts than 
it receives with respect to a Fund, or receives compensation based in part on 
the performance of certain accounts. This creates a conflict of interest for 
JPMIM and its portfolio managers by providing an incentive to favor those 
accounts. Actual or potential conflicts of interest also arise when a portfolio 
manager has management responsibilities to more than one account or Fund, such 
as devotion of unequal time and attention to the management of the Funds or 
accounts. 
 
Part II - 91 


Allocation and Aggregation. 
Potential conflicts of interest also arise with both the aggregation of trade 
orders and allocation of securities transactions or investment opportunities. 
Allocations of aggregated trades, particularly trade orders that were only 
partially filled due to limited availability, and allocation of investment 
opportunities raise a potential conflict of interest because JPMorgan has an 
incentive to allocate trades or investment opportunities to certain accounts or 
Funds. For example, JPMorgan has an incentive to cause accounts it manages to 
participate in an offering where such participation could increase JPMorgan’s 
overall allocation of securities in that offering. When JPMorgan serves as 
adviser to the Funds, as well as certain Funds-of-Funds, it faces certain 
potential conflicts of interest when allocating the assets of the Funds-of-Funds 
among its underlying Funds. For example, JPMorgan has an incentive to allocate 
assets of the Fund-of-Funds to seed a new Fund or to allocate to an underlying 
Fund that is small, pays higher fees to JPMorgan or to which JPMorgan has 
provided seed capital. 
Overall Position Limits. 
Potential conflicts of interest also exist when JPMorgan maintains certain 
overall investment limitations on positions in securities or other financial 
instruments due to, among other things, investment restrictions imposed upon 
JPMorgan by law, regulation, contract or internal policies. These limitations 
have precluded and, in the future could preclude, a Fund from purchasing 
particular securities or financial instruments, even if the securities or 
financial instruments would otherwise meet the Fund’s objectives. For example, 
there are limits on the aggregate amount of investments by affiliated investors 
in certain types of securities that may not be exceeded without additional 
regulatory or corporate consent. There also are limits on the writing of options 
by a Fund that could be triggered based on the number of options written by 
JPMIM on behalf of other investment advisory clients. If certain aggregate 
ownership thresholds are reached or certain transactions are undertaken, the 
ability of a Fund to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or 
undertake business transactions, will be restricted. 
Soft Dollars. JPMIM pays 
certain broker-dealers with “soft” or commission dollars generated by client 
brokerage transactions in exchange for access to statistical information and 
other research services. JPMIM faces conflicts of interest because the 
statistical information and other research services may benefit certain other 
clients of JPMIM more than a Fund and can be used in connection with the 
management of accounts other than the accounts whose trades generated the 
commissions. 
Additionally, when JPMIM uses client 
brokerage commissions to obtain statistical information and other research 
services, JPMIM receives a benefit because it does not have to produce or pay 
for the information or other research services itself. As a result, JPMIM may 
have an incentive to select a particular broker-dealer in order to obtain such 
information and other research services from that broker-dealer, rather than to 
obtain the lowest price for execution. 
Redemptions. JPMorgan, as a 
seed investor, JPMorgan Funds of Funds and JPMorgan on behalf of its 
discretionary clients have significant ownership in certain Funds. JPMorgan 
faces conflicts of interest when considering the effect of redemptions on such 
Funds and on other shareholders in deciding whether and when to redeem its 
shares. A large redemption of shares by JPMorgan, by a JPMorgan Fund of Funds or 
by JPMorgan acting on behalf of its discretionary clients could result in the 
Fund selling securities when it otherwise would not have done so, accelerating 
the realization of capital gains and increasing transaction costs. A large 
redemption could significantly reduce the assets of a Fund, causing decreased 
liquidity and, depending on any applicable expense caps, a higher expense ratio. 

Affiliated Transactions. The 
Funds are subject to conflicts of interest if they engage in principal or agency 
transactions with other Funds or with JPMorgan. To the extent permitted by law, 
the Funds can enter into transactions in which JPMorgan acts as principal on its 
own behalf (principal transactions), advises both sides of a transaction (cross 
transactions) and acts as broker for, and receives a commission from, the Funds 
(agency transactions). Principal and agency transactions create the opportunity 
for JPMorgan to engage in self-dealing. JPMorgan faces a conflict of interest 
when it engages in a principal or agency transaction on behalf of a Fund, 
because such transactions result in additional compensation to JPMorgan. 
JPMorgan faces a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and 
responsibilities to the parties in these transactions. 
In addition, Affiliates of JPMIM 
have direct or indirect interests in electronic communication networks and 
alternative trading systems (collectively “ECNs”). JPMIM, in accordance with its 
fiduciary obligation to seek to obtain best execution, from time to time 
executes client trades through ECNs in which an Affiliate has, or may acquire, 
an interest. In such case, the Affiliate will be indirectly compensated based 
upon its ownership percentage in relation to the transaction fees charged by the 
ECNs. 
JPMorgan also faces conflicts of 
interest if a Fund purchases securities during the existence of an underwriting 
syndicate for such securities, of which JPMorgan is a member because JPMorgan 
typically receives fees for certain 
 
Part II - 92 


services that it provides to the 
syndicate and, in certain cases, will be relieved directly or indirectly of 
certain financial obligations as a result of a Fund’s purchase of securities. 

Affiliated Service Providers. 
JPMorgan faces conflicts of interest when the Funds use service providers 
affiliated with JPMorgan because JPMorgan receives greater overall fees when 
they are used. Affiliates provide investment advisory, custody, administration, 
fund accounting and shareholder servicing services to the Funds for which they 
are compensated by the Funds. Similarly, JPMIM faces a conflict of interest if 
it decides to use or negotiate the terms of a credit facility for a Fund if the 
facility is provided by an Affiliate. In addition, in selecting actively managed 
underlying funds for JPMorgan Funds of Funds, JPMIM limits its selection to 
Funds in the JPMorgan family of mutual funds. JPMIM does not consider or canvass 
the universe of unaffiliated investment companies available, even though there 
may be unaffiliated investment companies that may be more appropriate for the 
JPMorgan Fund of Funds or that have superior returns. The JPMorgan affiliates 
providing services to the Funds benefit from additional fees when a Fund is 
included as an underlying Fund in a JPMorgan Fund of Funds. 
Proxy Voting. Potential 
conflicts of interest can arise when JPMIM votes proxies for securities held by 
a Fund. A conflict is deemed to exist when the proxy is for JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. stock or for J.P. Morgan Funds, or when the proxy 
administrator has actual knowledge indicating that an Affiliate is an investment 
banker or rendered a fairness opinion with respect to the matter that is the 
subject of the proxy vote. When such conflicts are identified, the proxy will be 
voted by an independent third party either in accordance with JPMIM’s proxy 
voting guidelines or by the third party using its own guidelines. Potential 
conflicts of interest can arise when JPMIM invests Fund assets in securities of 
companies that are also clients of JPMIM or that have material business 
relationships with JPMIM or an Affiliate and a vote against management could 
harm or otherwise affect JPMIM’s or the Affiliate’s business relationship with 
that company. See the Proxy Voting section in this SAI. 
Lending. JPMorgan faces 
conflicts of interest with respect to interfund lending or the JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. credit facility, which could harm the lending or the borrowing Fund 
if JPMorgan favors one Fund’s or JPMorgan’s interests over those of another 
Fund. If a Fund engages in securities lending transactions, JPMIM faces a 
conflict of interest when a JPMIM affiliate operates as a service provider in 
the securities lending transaction or otherwise receives compensation as part of 
the securities lending activities. 
Personal Trading. JPMorgan 
and any of its directors, officers, agents or employees, face conflicts of 
interest when transacting in securities for their own accounts because they 
could benefit by trading in the same securities as a Fund, which could have an 
adverse effect on a Fund. 
Valuation. JPMIM acting in 
its capacity as the Funds’ administrator is the primary valuation agent of the 
Funds. JPMIM values securities and assets in the Funds according to the Funds’ 
valuation policies. From time to time JPMIM will value an asset differently than 
an Affiliate values the identical asset, including because the Affiliate has 
information regarding valuation techniques and models or other information that 
it does not share with JPMIM. This arises particularly in connection with 
securities or other assets for which market quotations are not readily available 
or for which market quotations do not represent the value at the time of pricing 
(e.g., startup companies) and which are fair valued. JPMIM will also face a 
conflict with respect to valuations as they affect the amount of JPMIM’s 
compensation as investment adviser and administrator. 
Information Access. As a 
result of JPMorgan’s various other businesses, Affiliates, from time to time, 
comes into possession of information about certain markets and investments 
which, if known to JPMIM, could cause JPMIM to seek to dispose of, retain or 
increase interests in investments held by a Fund or acquire certain positions on 
behalf of a Fund. However, JPMorgan’s internal information barriers restrict 
JPMIM’s ability to access such information even when it would be relevant to its 
management of the Funds. Such Affiliates can trade differently from the Funds 
potentially based on information not available to JPMIM. If JPMIM acquires or is 
deemed to acquire material non-public information regarding an issuer, JPMIM 
will be restricted from purchasing or selling securities of that issuer for its 
clients, including a Fund, until the information has been publicly disclosed or 
is no longer deemed material. (Such an issuer could include an underlying Fund 
in a Fund-of-Funds.) 
Gifts and Entertainment. From 
time to time, employees of JPMIM receive gifts and/or entertainment from 
clients, intermediaries, or service providers to the Funds or JPMIM, which could 
have the appearance of affecting or may potentially affect the judgment of the 
employees, or the manner in which they conduct business. 
For Funds with Sub-Advisers: 
Additional Potential Conflicts of Interest

The Advisers to certain Funds have 
engaged affiliated and/or unaffiliated sub-advisers. The Adviser compensates 
sub-advisers out of the advisory fees it receives from the Fund, which creates 
an incentive for the 
 
Part II - 93 


Adviser to select sub-advisers with 
lower fee rates or to select affiliated sub-advisers. In addition, the 
sub-advisers have interests and relationships that create actual or potential 
conflicts of interest related to their management of the assets of the Funds 
allocated to such sub-advisers. Such conflicts of interest may be similar to, 
different from or supplement those conflicts described herein relating to 
JPMorgan. For example, in the case of the JPMorgan Multi-Manager Alternatives 
Fund JPMorgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. (“JPMAAM”), its investment 
adviser, primarily acts as a manager of managers in respect of that Fund and 
other funds it advises. Because the sub-advisers engage in direct trading 
strategies for the Fund assets allocated to them, the sub-advisers have 
potential conflicts of interest related to the investment of client assets in 
securities and other instruments that would not apply to JPMAAM unless JPMAAM is 
also engaging in direct trading strategies, or could apply to JPMAAM in a 
different or more limited manner. Such potential conflicts relate to the 
sub-advisers’ trading and investment practices, including, but not limited to, 
their selection of broker-dealers, aggregation of orders for multiple clients or 
netting of orders for the same client and the investment of client assets in 
companies in which they have an interest. Additional information about potential 
conflicts of interest regarding the sub-advisers is set forth in each 
sub-adviser’s Form ADV. A copy of Part 1 and Part 2 of each sub-adviser’s Form 
ADV is available on the SEC’s website (www.adviserinfo.sec.gov). 
For details of the dollar range 
of shares of each Fund (excluding the Money Market Funds) beneficially owned by 
the portfolio managers, see “PORTFOLIO MANAGERS — Ownership of Securities” in 
Part I of this SAI. 
PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION 
JPMorgan’s portfolio managers 
participate in a competitive compensation program that is designed to attract, 
retain and motivate talented people and closely link the performance of 
investment professionals to client investment objectives. JPMorgan manages 
compensation on a total compensation basis, the components being base salary 
fixed from year to year and a variable discretionary incentive award. Base 
salaries are reviewed annually and awarded based on individual performance and 
business results taking into account level and scope of position, experience and 
market competitiveness. The variable discretionary performance based incentive 
award consists of cash incentives and deferred compensation which includes 
mandatory notional investments (as described below) in selected mutual funds 
advised by JPMorgan or its affiliates (“Mandatory Investment Plan”). These 
elements reflect individual performance and the performance of JPMorgan’s 
business as a whole. Each portfolio manager’s performance is formally evaluated 
annually based on a variety of factors including the aggregate size and blended 
performance of the portfolios such portfolio manager manages, individual 
contribution relative to client risk and return objectives, and adherence with 
JPMorgan’s compliance, risk and regulatory procedures. In evaluating each 
portfolio manager’s performance with respect to the mutual funds he or she 
manages, the pre-tax performance of the funds (or the portion of the funds 
managed by the portfolio manager) is compared to the appropriate market peer 
group and to competitive indices JPMorgan has identified for the investment 
strategy over one, three and five year periods (or such shorter time as the 
portfolio manager has managed the funds). Investment performance is generally 
more heavily weighted to the long-term. 
Deferred compensation granted as 
part of an employee’s annual incentive compensation comprises from 0% to 60% of 
a portfolio manager’s total performance based incentive. As the level of 
incentive compensation increases, the percentage of compensation awarded in 
deferred incentives also increases. JPMorgan’s portfolio managers are required 
to notionally invest a certain percentage of their deferred compensation 
(typically 20% to 50% depending on the level of compensation) into the selected 
funds they manage. The remaining portion of the non-cash incentive is elective 
and may be notionally invested in any of the other mutual funds available in the 
Mandatory Investment Plan or will take the form of a JPMorgan in restricted 
stock unit award. When these awards vest over time, the portfolio manager 
receives cash equal to the market value of the notional investment in the 
selected mutual funds or shares of JPMorgan common stock. 
CODES OF ETHICS 
The Trusts, the Advisers and JPMDS 
have each adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act (and pursuant to 
Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act with 
respect to the Advisers). 
The Trusts’ code of ethics includes 
policies which require “access persons” (as defined in Rule 17j-1) to: (i) place the interest of 
Trust shareholders first; (ii) conduct personal securities transactions in 
a manner that avoids any actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse 
of a position of trust and responsibility; and (iii) refrain from taking 
inappropriate advantage of his or her position with the Trusts or a Fund. The 
Trusts’ code of ethics prohibits any access person from: (i) employing any 
device, scheme or artifice to defraud the Trusts or a Fund; (ii) making to 

 
Part II - 94 


the Trusts or a Fund any untrue 
statement of a material fact or omit to state to the Trusts or a Fund a material 
fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the 
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; (iii) engaging in 
any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a 
fraud or deceit upon the Trusts or a Fund; or (iv) engaging in any 
manipulative practice with respect to the Trusts or a Fund. The Trusts’ code of 
ethics permits personnel subject to the code to invest in securities, including 
securities that may be purchased or held by a Fund so long as such investment 
transactions are not in contravention of the above noted policies and 
prohibitions. 
The code of ethics adopted by the 
Advisers requires that all employees must: (i) place the interest of the 
accounts which are managed by the Adviser first; (ii) conduct all personal 
securities transactions in a manner that is consistent with the code of ethics 
and the individual employee’s position of trust and responsibility; and 
(iii) refrain from taking inappropriate advantage of their position. 
Employees of each Adviser are also prohibited from certain mutual fund trading 
activity including excessive trading of shares of a mutual fund as described in 
the applicable Fund’s Prospectuses or SAI and effecting or facilitating a mutual 
fund transaction to engage in market timing. The Advisers’ code of ethics 
permits personnel subject to the code to invest in securities, including 
securities that may be purchased or held by a Fund subject to certain 
restrictions. However, all employees are required to preclear securities trades 
(except for certain types of securities such as non-proprietary mutual fund shares and U.S. 
government securities). Each of the Adviser’s affiliated sub-advisers has also adopted the code of 
ethics described above. 
JPMDS’s code of ethics requires that 
all employees of JPMDS must: (i) place the interest of the accounts which 
are managed by affiliates of JPMDS first; (ii) conduct all personal 
securities transactions in a manner that is consistent with the code of ethics 
and the individual employee’s position of trust and responsibility; and 
(iii) refrain from taking inappropriate advantage of their positions. 
Employees of JPMDS are also prohibited from certain mutual fund trading 
activity, including excessive trading of shares of a mutual fund as such term is 
defined in the applicable Fund’s Prospectuses or SAI, or effecting or 
facilitating a mutual fund transaction to engage in market timing. JPMDS’s code 
of ethics permits personnel subject to the code to invest in securities, 
including securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds subject to the 
policies and restrictions in such code of ethics. 
PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 
Investment Decisions and Portfolio Transactions. 
Pursuant to the Advisory and sub-advisory Agreements, the Advisers 
determine, subject to the general supervision of the Board of Trustees of the 
Trusts and in accordance with each Fund’s investment objective and restrictions, 
which securities are to be purchased and sold by each such Fund and which 
brokers are to be eligible to execute its portfolio transactions. The Advisers 
operate independently in providing services to their respective clients. 
Investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic 
suitability for the particular client involved. Thus, for example, a particular 
security may be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have 
been bought or sold for other clients at the same time. Likewise, a particular 
security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients 
are selling the security. In some instances, one client may sell a particular 
security to another client. It also happens that two or more clients may 
simultaneously buy or sell the same security, in which event each day’s 
transactions in such security are, insofar as possible, averaged as to price and 
allocated between such clients in a manner which in the opinion of the Adviser 
is equitable to each and in accordance with the amount being purchased or sold 
by each. There may be circumstances when purchases or sales of portfolio 
securities for one or more clients will have an adverse effect on other clients. 

Brokerage and Research Services. On behalf of the 
Funds, a Fund’s Adviser places orders for all purchases and sales of portfolio 
securities, enters into repurchase agreements, and may enter into reverse 
repurchase agreements and execute loans of portfolio securities on behalf of a 
Fund unless otherwise prohibited. See “Investment Strategies and Policies.” 

Fixed income and debt securities and 
municipal bonds and notes are generally traded at a net price with dealers 
acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The 
price of the security usually includes profit to the dealers. In underwritten 
offerings, securities are purchased at a fixed price, which includes an amount 
of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s 
concession or discount. Transactions on stock exchanges (other than foreign 
stock exchanges) involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions. Such 
commissions vary among different brokers. Also, a particular broker may charge 
different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of 
the transaction. Transactions in foreign securities generally involve payment of 
fixed brokerage commissions, which are generally higher than those in the U.S. 
On occasion, certain securities may be purchased directly from an issuer, in 
which case no commissions or discounts are paid. 
 
Part II - 95 


In connection with portfolio 
transactions, the overriding objective is to obtain the best execution of 
purchase and sales orders. In making this determination, the Adviser considers a 
number of factors including, but not limited to: the price per unit of the 
security, the broker’s execution capabilities, the commissions charged, the 
broker’s reliability for prompt, accurate confirmations and on-time delivery of securities, the 
broker-dealer firm’s financial condition, the broker’s ability to provide access 
to public offerings, as well as the quality of research services provided. As 
permitted by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, the Adviser may 
cause the Funds to pay a broker-dealer 
which provides brokerage and research services to the Adviser, or the Funds 
and/or other accounts for which the Adviser exercises investment discretion an 
amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for a Fund in excess 
of the amount other broker-dealers would have charged for the transaction if the 
Adviser determines in good faith that the greater commission is reasonable in 
relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the 
executing broker-dealer viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or 
the Adviser’s overall responsibilities to accounts over which it exercises 
investment discretion. Not all such services are useful or of value in advising 
the Funds. The Adviser reports to the Board of Trustees regarding overall 
commissions paid by the Funds and their reasonableness in relation to the 
benefits to the Funds. In accordance with Section 28(e) of the Securities 
Exchange Act and consistent with applicable SEC guidance and interpretation, the 
term “brokerage and research services” includes (i) advice as to the value 
of securities; (ii) the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling 
securities; (iii) the availability of securities or of purchasers or 
sellers of securities; (iv) furnishing analyses and reports concerning 
issues, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy 
and the performance of accounts; and (v) effecting securities transactions 
and performing functions incidental thereto (such as clearance, settlement, and 
custody) or required by rule or regulation in connection with such transactions. 

Brokerage and research services 
received from such broker-dealers will be in addition to, and not in lieu of, 
the services required to be performed by an Adviser under the Advisory Agreement 
(or with respect to a Sub-Adviser, 
under the sub-advisory agreement). The 
fees that the Funds pay to the Adviser are not reduced as a consequence of the 
Adviser’s receipt of brokerage and research services. To the extent the Funds’ 
portfolio transactions are used to obtain such services, the brokerage 
commissions paid by the Funds may exceed those that might otherwise be paid by 
an amount that cannot be presently determined. Such services generally would be 
useful and of value to the Adviser in serving one or more of its other clients 
and, conversely, such services obtained by the placement of brokerage business 
of other clients generally would be useful to the Adviser in carrying out its 
obligations to the Funds. While such services are not expected to reduce the 
expenses of the Adviser, the Adviser would, through use of the services, avoid 
the additional expenses that would be incurred if it should attempt to develop 
comparable information through its own staff. 
Subject to the overriding objective 
of obtaining the best execution of orders, the Adviser may allocate a portion of 
a Fund’s brokerage transactions to affiliates of the Adviser. Under the 1940 
Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such 
persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase 
and sale of securities unless an exemptive order allowing such transactions is 
obtained from the SEC. The SEC has granted exemptive orders permitting each Fund 
to engage in principal transactions with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an 
affiliated broker, involving taxable and tax exempt money market instruments 
(including commercial paper, banker acceptances and medium term notes) and 
repurchase agreements. The orders are subject to certain conditions. An 
affiliated person of a Fund may serve as its broker in listed or over-the-counter transactions 
conducted on an agency basis provided that, among other things, the fee or 
commission received by such affiliated broker is reasonable and fair compared to 
the fee or commission received by non-affiliated brokers in connection with 
comparable transactions. 
In addition, a Fund may not purchase 
securities during the existence of any underwriting syndicate for such 
securities of which JPMorgan Chase Bank or an affiliate is a member or in a 
private placement in which JPMorgan Chase Bank or an affiliate serves as 
placement agent, except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees 
that either comply with rules adopted by the SEC or with interpretations of the 
SEC’s staff. Each Fund expects to purchase securities from underwriting 
syndicates of which certain affiliates of JPMorgan Chase act as a member or 
manager. Such purchases will be effected in accordance with the conditions set 
forth in Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act 
and related procedures adopted by the Trustees, including a majority of the 
Trustees who are not “interested persons” of a Fund. Among the conditions are 
that the issuer of any purchased securities will have been in operation for at 
least three years, that not more than 25% of the underwriting will be purchased 
by a Fund and all other accounts over which the same investment adviser has 
discretion, and that no shares will be purchased from JPMDS or any of its 
affiliates. 
 
 
Part II - 96 


On those occasions when the Adviser 
deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interests of a Fund 
as well as other customers, including other Funds, the Adviser, to the extent 
permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may, but is not obligated to, 
aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a Fund with those to be 
sold or purchased for other customers in order to obtain best execution, 
including lower brokerage commissions if appropriate. In such event, allocation 
of the securities so purchased or sold as well as any expenses incurred in the 
transaction will be made by the Adviser in the manner it considers to be most 
equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to its customers, 
including the Funds. In some instances, the allocation procedure might not 
permit a Fund to participate in the benefits of the aggregated trade. 

If a Fund that writes options 
effects a closing purchase transaction with respect to an option written by it, 
normally such transaction will be executed by the same broker-dealer who 
executed the sale of the option. The writing of options by a Fund will be 
subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges governing the 
maximum number of options in each class which may be written by a single 
investor or group of investors acting in concert, regardless of whether the 
options are written on the same or different exchanges or are held or written in 
one or more accounts or through one or more brokers. The number of options that 
a Fund may write may be affected by options written by the Adviser for other 
investment advisory clients. An exchange may order the liquidation of positions 
found to be in excess of these limits, and it may impose certain other 
sanctions. 
Allocation of transactions, 
including their frequency, to various broker-dealers is determined by a Fund’s 
Adviser based on its best judgment and in a manner deemed fair and reasonable to 
Shareholders and consistent with the Adviser’s obligation to obtain the best 
execution of purchase and sales orders. In making this determination, the 
Adviser considers the same factors for the best execution of purchase and sales 
orders listed above. Accordingly, in selecting broker-dealers to execute a 
particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, a 
Fund’s Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as 
those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) 
provided to the Funds and/or other accounts over which a Fund’s Adviser 
exercises investment discretion. A Fund’s Adviser may cause a Fund to pay a 
broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission 
than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same 
transaction, provided that a Fund’s Adviser determines in good faith that such 
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research 
services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the 
particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of a Fund’s Adviser to 
the Funds. To the extent such services are permissible under the safe harbor 
requirements of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act and consistent 
with applicable SEC guidance and interpretation, such brokerage and research 
services might consist of advice as to the value of securities, the advisability 
of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, the availability of 
securities or purchasers or sellers of securities; analyses and reports 
concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, 
portfolio strategy, and the performance of accounts, market data, stock quotes, 
last sale prices, and trading volumes. Shareholders of the Funds should 
understand that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to a Fund’s 
Adviser in connection with its services to other clients and not all the 
services may be used by the Adviser in connection with the Fund. 
Under the policy for JPMIM, “soft 
dollar” services refer to arrangements that fall within the safe harbor 
requirements of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, 
which allow JPMIM to allocate client brokerage transactions to a broker-dealer 
in exchange for products or services that are research and brokerage-related and 
provide lawful and appropriate assistance in the performance of the investment 
decision-making process. These services include third party research, market 
data services, and proprietary broker-dealer research. The Funds receive 
proprietary research where broker-dealers typically incorporate the cost of such 
research into their commission structure. Many brokers do not assign a hard 
dollar value to the research they provide, but rather bundle the cost of such 
research into their commission structure. It is noted in this regard that some 
research that is available only under a bundled commission structure is 
particularly important to the investment process. However, the Funds, other than 
the U.S. Equity Funds (except the JPMorgan Equity Index Fund), JPMorgan Research 
Market Neutral Fund, JPMorgan Realty Income Fund, JPMorgan Research Equity 
Long/Short Fund, and JPMorgan Tax Aware Equity Fund, do not participate in soft 
dollar arrangements for market data services and third-party research. 

The U.S. Equity Funds (except the 
JPMorgan Equity Index Fund), JPMorgan Research Market Neutral Fund, JPMorgan 
Realty Income Fund, JPMorgan Research Equity Long/Short Fund, and JPMorgan Tax 
Aware Equity Fund participate in soft dollar arrangements whereby a 
broker-dealer provides market data services and third-party research in addition 
to proprietary research. In order to obtain such research, the Adviser may 
utilize a Client Commission Arrangement (“CCA”). CCAs are agreements between an 
investment adviser and executing broker whereby the investment adviser and the 
broker agree to allocate a portion of commissions to a pool of credits 
maintained by the broker that are used to pay for eligible brokerage and 
research services. The Adviser will only 
 
Part II - 97 


enter into and utilize CCAs to the 
extent permitted by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act. As 
required by interpretive guidance issued by the SEC, any CCAs entered into by 
the Adviser with respect to commissions generated by the U.S. Equity Funds will 
provide that: (1) the broker-dealer pay the research preparer directly; and 
(2) the broker-dealer take steps to assure itself that the client 
commissions that the Adviser directs it to use to pay for such services are only 
for eligible research under Section 28(e). 
SCR&M does not enter into soft 
dollar arrangements whereby a broker pays for research services such as 
Bloomberg, Reuters or Factset. From time to time, SCR&M may receive or have 
access to research generally provided by a broker to the broker’s institutional 
clients that trade with the broker in the sector of the securities markets in 
which SCR&M is active, namely in the case of real estate securities. In 
addition, SCR&M may consider the value-added quality of proprietary broker 
research received from brokers in allocating trades to brokers subject always to 
the objective of obtaining best execution. 
JPMAAM itself generally does not 
execute individual securities trading but instead allocates client assets to 
sub-advisers who execute securities trading or to underlying funds. JPMAAM 
performs due diligence prior to allocating client assets to sub-advisers or to 
underlying funds and that due diligence includes a review of the sub-advisers’ 
and/or underlying funds’ trading practices. Periodically thereafter, such due 
diligence includes a review of the best execution policies of the sub-advisers 
and the underlying funds’ investment advisers. JPMAAM does not engage in any 
soft dollar arrangements at this time, although it will review and perform 
diligence on the soft dollar policies and practices of any sub-advisers it 
allocates assets to and of underlying fund in which it invests client assets. 

Investment decisions for each Fund 
are made independently from those for the other Funds or any other investment 
company or account managed by an Adviser. Any such other investment company or 
account may also invest in the same securities as the Trusts. When a purchase or 
sale of the same security is made at substantially the same time on behalf of a 
given Fund and another Fund, investment company or account, the transaction will 
be averaged as to price, and available investments allocated as to amount, in a 
manner which the Adviser of the given Fund believes to be equitable to the 
Fund(s) and such other investment company or account. In some instances, this 
procedure may adversely affect the price paid or received by a Fund or the size 
of the position obtained by a Fund. To the extent permitted by law, the Adviser 
may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased by it for a Fund with those 
to be sold or purchased by it for other Funds or for other investment companies 
or accounts in order to obtain best execution. In making investment 
recommendations for the Trusts, the Adviser will not inquire or take into 
consideration whether an issuer of securities proposed for purchase or sale by 
the Trusts is a customer of the Adviser or their parents or subsidiaries or 
affiliates and in dealing with its commercial customers, the Adviser and their 
respective parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates will not inquire or take into 
consideration whether securities of such customers are held by the Trusts. 

Sub-Advisers 
Sub-Adviser may place orders for the 
purchase and sale of securities that are held in the Fund. In executing 
portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or dealers, it is the policy and 
principal objective of each Sub-Adviser to seek best execution. Each Sub-Adviser 
is required to consider all factors that it deems relevant when assessing best 
execution for the Fund, including, for example, the breadth of the market in the 
security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution 
capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if 
any (for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis). 
In addition, when selecting brokers 
to execute transactions and in evaluating the best execution, each Sub-Adviser 
is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as defined in 
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), provided by 
the broker. Each Sub-Adviser is also authorized to cause the Fund to pay a 
commission to a broker who provides such brokerage and research services for 
executing a portfolio transaction which is in excess of the amount of commission 
another broker would have charged for effecting that transaction. Each 
Sub-Adviser must determine in good faith, however, that such commission was 
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services 
provided viewed in terms of that particular transaction or in terms of all the 
accounts over which each Sub-Adviser exercises investment discretion. Brokerage 
and research services received from such brokers will be in addition to, and not 
in lieu of, the services required to be performed by each Sub-Adviser. The Fund 
may purchase and sell portfolio securities through brokers who provide a 
Sub-Adviser with brokerage and research services. 
The fees of each Sub-Adviser are not 
reduced by reason of its receipt of such brokerage and research services. 
Generally, a Sub-Adviser does not provide any services to the Fund except 
portfolio investment management and related record-keeping services. The Adviser 
may request that a Sub-Adviser employ certain specific brokers who 
 
Part II - 98 


have agreed to pay certain Fund 
expenses. The use of such brokers is subject to best execution, and there is no 
specific amount of brokerage that is required to be placed through such brokers. 

It is possible that certain of the 
services received by a Sub-Adviser attributable to a particular transaction will 
primarily benefit one or more other accounts for which investment discretion is 
exercised by the Sub-Adviser.

commissions paid by the Funds, see “BROKERAGE AND RESEARCH SERVICES — Brokerage 
Commissions” in Part I of this SAI.

OVERVIEW OF SERVICE PROVIDER AGREEMENTS 

The following sections provide an 
overview of the J.P. Morgan Funds’ agreements with various service providers 
including the Administrator, Distributor, Securities Lending Agent, Custodian, 
Transfer Agent, and Shareholder Servicing Agent. As indicated below, some of the 
service agreements for the JPMorgan SmartRetirement Blend Funds and other J.P. 
Morgan Funds are different than the services agreements for the other JPMorgan 
SmartRetirement Funds. For purposes of distinguishing between the agreements and 
expenses, the JPMorgan SmartRetirement Funds other than the JPMorgan 
SmartRetirement Blend Funds are referred to in the following as the “JPMorgan SR 
Funds.” 
ADMINISTRATOR 
JPMIM (the 
“Administrator”)1 serves as the administrator to the 
Funds, pursuant to an Administration Agreement dated February 19, 2005 (the 
“Administration Agreement”), between the Trusts, on behalf of the Funds, and 
JPMIM. Additionally, JPMIM serves as the administrator to the JPMorgan SR Funds 
pursuant to an agreement effective May 5, 2006 (the “SR Administration 
Agreement”), between JPMT I, on behalf of the JPMorgan SR Funds, and JPMIM. 
JPMDS and JPMorgan Chase Bank and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of 
JPMorgan Chase. 
Pursuant to the Administration 
Agreement and the SR Administration Agreement, JPMIM performs or supervises all 
operations of each Fund for which it serves (other than those performed under 
the advisory agreement, any sub-advisory agreements, the custodian and 
fund accounting agreement, and the transfer agency agreement for that Fund). 
Under the Administration Agreement and the SR Administration Agreement, JPMIM 
has agreed to maintain the necessary office space for the Funds, and to furnish 
certain other services required by the Funds with respect to each Fund. The 
Administrator prepares annual and semi-annual reports to the SEC, prepares 
federal and state tax returns and generally assists in all aspects of the Funds’ 
operations other than those performed under the advisory agreement, any sub-advisory agreements, the custodian and 
fund accounting agreement, and the transfer agency agreement. JPMIM may, at its 
expense, subcontract with any entity or person concerning the provision of 
services under the Administration Agreement and the SR Administration Agreement. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank serves as the Funds’ sub-administrator (the “Sub-administrator”). 
The Administrator pays JPMorgan Chase Bank a fee for its services as the Funds’ 
Sub-administrator. 
If not terminated, the 
Administration Agreement and the SR Administration Agreement continue in effect 
for annual periods beyond October 31 of each year, provided that such 
continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of a majority 
of those members of the Board of Trustees who are not parties to the 
Administration Agreement or SR Administration Agreement or interested persons of 
any such party. The Administration Agreement and the SR Administration Agreement 
may be terminated without penalty, on not less than 60 days’ prior written 
notice, by the Board of Trustees of each Trust or by JPMIM. The termination of 
the Administration Agreement or the SR Administration Agreement with respect to 
one Fund will not result in the termination of the Administration Agreement with 
respect to any other Fund. 
The Administration Agreement and the 
SR Administration Agreement provide that JPMIM shall not be liable for any error 
of judgment or mistake of law or any loss suffered by the Funds in connection 
with the matters to which the Administration Agreement relates, except a loss 
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance 
of its duties, or from the reckless disregard by it of its obligations and 
duties thereunder.

JPMorgan Funds Management, Inc. (“JPMFM”), the former Administrator, was merged 
with and into JPMIM effective April 1, 2016. 
 
Part II - 99 


In consideration of the services to 
be provided by JPMIM pursuant to the Administration Agreement, JPMIM receives 
from each Fund a pro rata portion of a fee computed daily and paid monthly at an 
annual rate equal to 0.15% of the first $25 billion of average daily net assets 
of all funds in the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex (excluding certain funds of funds 
and the series of J.P. Morgan Funds Complex that operate as money market funds 
(each a “Money Market Fund”)) and 0.075% of average daily net assets of all 
funds in the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex (excluding certain funds of funds and the 
Money Market Funds) over $25 billion of such assets. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the “J.P. Morgan Funds Complex” includes most of the open-end investment companies in the J.P. 
Morgan Funds Complex, including the series of the former One Group Mutual Funds. 

With respect to the Money Market 
Funds, in consideration of the services provided by JPMIM pursuant to the 
Administration Agreement, JPMIM will receive from each Fund a pro-rata portion of a fee computed daily and 
paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.10% on the first $100 billion of the average 
daily net assets of all the money market funds in the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex 
and 0.05% of the average daily net assets of the money market funds in the J.P. 
Morgan Funds Complex over $100 billion. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
“J.P. Morgan Funds Complex” includes most of the open-end investment companies in the J.P. 
Morgan Funds Complex including the series of the former One Group Mutual Funds. 

With respect to the Investor Funds 
and JPMorgan Diversified Real Return Fund, in consideration of the services 
provided by JPMIM pursuant to the Administration Agreement, JPMIM will receive 
from each Fund a pro rata portion of a fee computed daily and paid monthly at an 
annual rate of 0.10% of the first $500 million of average daily net assets of 
all the Investor Funds and JPMorgan Diversified Real Return Fund in the 
J.P. Morgan Funds Complex, 0.075% of certain Funds of Funds’ average daily 
net assets between $500 million and $1 billion and 0.05% of certain Funds of 
Funds’ average daily net assets in excess of $1 billion. 
JPMIM does not charge a fee for 
providing administrative services to the JPMorgan SR Funds under the 
SR Administration Agreement, but does receive fees for its services to the 
acquired funds. 
For details of the administration 
and administrative services fees paid or accrued, see “ADMINISTRATOR — 
Administration Fees” in Part I of this SAI. 
DISTRIBUTOR 
JPMDS serves as the distributor for 
all the Trusts and holds itself available to receive purchase orders for shares 
of each of the Funds. In that capacity, JPMDS has been granted the right, as 
agent of each Trust, to solicit and accept orders for the purchase of shares of 
each of the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement 
between each Trust and JPMDS. JPMDS began serving as JPMT II’s distributor 
pursuant to a Distribution Agreement dated as of April 1, 2002. JPMDS is an 
affiliate of the Advisers, the Administrator and JPMorgan Chase Bank and is a 
direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase. The principal offices of 
JPMDS are located at 1111 Polaris Parkway, Columbus, OH 43240. 
Unless otherwise terminated, the 
Distribution Agreement with JPMDS will continue in effect for successive 
one-year terms if approved at least annually by: (a) the vote of the Board 
of Trustees, including the vote of a majority of those members of the Board of 
Trustees who are not parties to the Distribution Agreement or interested persons 
of any such party, cast in person at a meeting for the purpose of voting on such 
approval, or (b) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting 
securities of the Fund. The Distribution Agreement may be terminated without 
penalty on not less than 60 days’ prior written notice by the Board of Trustees, 
by vote of majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by 
JPMDS. The termination of the Distribution Agreement with respect to one Fund 
will not result in the termination of the Distribution Agreement with respect to 
any other Fund. The Distribution Agreement may also be terminated in the event 
of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act. JPMDS is a broker-dealer 
registered with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (“FINRA”). 
For details of the compensation 
paid to the principal underwriter, JPMDS, see “DISTRIBUTOR — Compensation paid 
to JPMDS” in Part I of this SAI. 
DISTRIBUTION PLAN 
Certain Funds have adopted a plan of 
distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act (the “Distribution Plan”) 
on behalf of the Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class R2 Shares, Cash 
Management Shares, Morgan Shares, Reserve Shares, Service Shares, Eagle Shares 
and E*TRADE Class Shares of the applicable Funds, which provides that each of 
such classes shall pay for distribution services a distribution fee (the 
“Distribution Fee”) to JPMDS, at annual rates not to exceed the amounts set 
forth in each applicable Fund’s prospectuses. The Class L 
 
Part II - 100 


Shares (formerly Institutional Class 
Shares), Select Class Shares, Class R5 Shares, Investor Shares, Class R6 Shares, 
IM Shares, Premier Shares, Capital Shares, Direct Shares and Agency Shares of 
the Funds have no Distribution Plan. Effective June 19, 2015, Class B Shares 
were converted into Class A Shares (Morgan Shares for the Money Market Funds). 

The Distribution Fees are paid by 
the Funds to JPMDS as compensation for its services and expenses in connection 
with the sale and distribution of Fund shares. JPMDS in turn pays all or part of 
these Distribution Fees to Financial Intermediaries that have agreements with 
JPMDS to sell shares of the Funds. In addition, JPMDS may use the Distribution 
Fees payable under the Distribution Plan to finance any other activity that is 
primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited 
to, (i) the development, formulation and implementation of marketing and 
promotional activities, including direct mail promotions and television, radio, 
magazine, newspaper, electronic and media advertising; (ii) the 
preparation, printing and distribution of prospectuses, statements of additional 
information and reports and any supplements thereto (other than prospectuses, 
statements of additional information and reports and any supplements thereto 
used for regulatory purposes or distributed to existing shareholders of each 
Fund); (iii) the preparation, printing and distribution of sales and 
promotional materials and sales literature which is provided to various entities 
and individuals, including brokers, dealers, financial institutions, financial 
intermediaries, shareholders, and prospective investors in each Fund; 
(iv) expenditures for sales or distribution support services, including 
meetings with and assistance to brokers, dealers, financial institutions, and 
financial intermediaries and in-house telemarketing support services and 
expenses; (v) preparation of information, analyses, surveys, and opinions 
with respect to marketing and promotional activities, including those based on 
meetings with and feedback from JPMDS’s sales force and others including 
potential investors, shareholders and financial intermediaries; 
(vi) commissions, incentive compensation, finders’ fees, or other 
compensation paid to, and expenses of employees of JPMDS, brokers, dealers, and 
other financial institutions and financial intermediaries that are attributable 
to any distribution and/or sales support activities, including interest expenses 
and other costs associated with financing of such commissions, incentive 
compensation, other compensation, fees, and expenses; (vii) travel, 
promotional materials, equipment, printing, delivery and mailing costs, overhead 
and other office expenses of JPMDS and its sales force attributable to any 
distribution and/or sales support activities, including meetings with brokers, 
dealers, financial institutions and financial intermediaries in order to provide 
them with information regarding the Funds and their investment process and 
management; (viii) the costs of administering the Distribution Plan; 
(ix) expenses of organizing and conducting sales seminars; and (x) any 
other costs and expenses relating to any distribution and/or sales support 
activities. Activities intended to promote one class of shares of a Fund may 
also benefit the Fund’s other shares and other Funds. Anticipated benefits to 
the Funds that may result from the adoption of the Distribution Plan are 
economic advantages achieved through economies of scale and enhanced viability 
if the Funds accumulate a critical mass. 
Class A, Class C and Class 
R2 Shares. Class A Shares of the Funds pay a Distribution Fee of 0.25% 
of average daily net assets. Class R2 Shares of the Funds pay a Distribution Fee 
of 0.50% of average daily net assets. Class C Shares of the Funds pay a 
Distribution Fee of 0.75% of average daily nets assets. JPMDS currently expects 
to pay sales commissions to a dealer at the time of sale of Class C Shares of 
the Funds of up to 1.00% of the purchase price of the shares sold by such 
dealer. JPMDS will use its own funds (which may be borrowed or otherwise 
financed) to pay such commissions and generally recoups such amounts through 
collection of the Distribution and Shareholder Servicing Fee and any contingent 
deferred sales charge (“CDSC”) for the first year following the purchase of such 
shares. Distribution Fees paid to JPMDS under the Distribution Plan may be paid 
by JPMDS to broker-dealers as distribution fees in an amount not to exceed 0.25% 
annualized of the average daily net asset value of the Class A Shares or 
0.75% annualized of the average daily net asset value of the Class C Shares or 
0.50% annualized of the average daily net asset value of the Class R2 Shares 
maintained in a Fund by such broker-dealers’ customers. Such payments on 
Class A and Class R2 Shares will be paid to broker- dealers promptly after 
the shares are purchased. Such payments on Class C Shares will be paid to 
broker-dealers beginning in the 13th month following the purchase of such 
shares, except certain broker/dealers who have sold Class C Shares to certain 
defined contribution plans and who have waived the 1.00% sales commission shall 
be paid distribution and shareholder servicing fees promptly after the shares 
are purchased. 
Since the Distribution Fee is not 
directly tied to expenses, the amount of Distribution Fees paid by a class of a 
Fund during any year may be more or less than actual expenses incurred pursuant 
to the Distribution Plan. For this reason, this type of distribution fee 
arrangement is characterized by the staff of the SEC as being of the 
“compensation” variety (in contrast to “reimbursement” arrangements by which a 
distributor’s payments are directly linked to its expenses). With respect to 
Class C Shares of the Funds, because of the 0.75% annual limitation on the 
compensation paid to JPMDS during a fiscal year, compensation relating to a 
large portion of the commissions attributable to sales of Class C Shares 

 
Part II - 101 


in any one year will be accrued and 
paid by a Fund to JPMDS in fiscal years subsequent. However, the shares are not 
liable for any distribution expenses incurred in excess of the Distribution Fee 
paid. 
Money Market Funds. 
Distribution Fees paid to JPMDS under the Distribution Plans adopted by the 
Money Market Funds may be paid by JPMDS to broker-dealers as distributions fees 
in an amount not to exceed 0.75% annualized of the average daily net asset value 
of the Class C Shares, 0.50% annualized of the average daily net asset value of 
the Cash Management Shares, 0.25% annualized of the average daily net asset 
value of the Reserve and Eagle Shares, 0.10% annualized of the average daily net 
asset value of the Morgan Shares (except for Morgan Shares of the Prime Money 
Market Fund), 0.60% annualized of the average daily net asset value of the 
E*TRADE and Service Shares, maintained in a Fund by such broker-dealers’ 
customers. For Class C Shares, distribution fees will be paid to 
broker-dealers beginning in the 13th month following the purchase of such 
shares. Since the distribution fees are not directly tied to expenses, the 
amount of Distribution Fees paid by a class of a Fund during any year may be 
more or less than actual expenses incurred pursuant to the Distribution Plan. 
For this reason, this type of distribution fee arrangement is characterized by 
the staff of the SEC as being of the “compensation variety” (in contrast to 
“reimbursement” arrangements by which a distributor’s payments are directly 
linked to its expenses). No class of shares of a Fund will make payments or be 
liable for any distribution expenses incurred by other classes of shares of any 
Fund. 
JPMDS, JPMIM or their affiliates may 
from time to time, at its or their own expense, out of compensation retained by 
them from the Funds or from other sources available to them, make additional 
payments to certain Financial Intermediaries for their marketing support 
services. Such compensation does not represent an additional expense to the 
Funds or to their shareholders, since it will be paid by JPMDS, JPMIM or their 
affiliates. See “ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION TO FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES” 
below.” 
The Distribution Plan provides that 
it will continue in effect indefinitely if such continuance is specifically 
approved at least annually by a vote of both a majority of the Trustees and a 
majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 
1940 Act) of the Trusts and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in 
the operation of the Distribution Plan or in any agreement related to such plan 
(“Qualified Trustees”). The Distribution Plan may be terminated, with respect to 
any class of a Fund, at any time by a vote of a majority of the Qualified 
Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of the class 
of such Fund to which it applies (as defined in the 1940 Act and the rules 
thereunder). The Distribution Plan may not be amended to increase materially the 
amount of permitted expenses thereunder without the approval of the affected 
shareholders and may not be materially amended in any case without a vote of the 
majority of both the Trustees and the Qualified Trustees. Each of the Funds will 
preserve copies of any plan, agreement or report made pursuant to Rule 12b-1 for 
a period of not less than six years from the date of such plan, agreement or 
report, and for the first two years such copies will be preserved in an easily 
accessible place. The Board of Trustees will review at least on a quarterly 
basis written reports of the amounts expended under the Distribution Plan 
indicating the purposes for which such expenditures were made. The selection and 
nomination of Qualified Trustees shall be committed to the discretion of the 
disinterested Trustees (as defined in the 1940 Act) then in office. 
For details of the Distribution 
Fees that the Funds paid to or that were accrued by JPMDS, see “DISTRIBUTOR — 
Distribution Fees” in Part I of this SAI. 
SECURITIES LENDING AGENT 
To generate additional income, 
certain Funds may lend up to 33 1/3% of their total assets pursuant to 
agreements (“Borrower Agreements”) requiring that the loan be continuously 
secured by cash or U.S. Treasury securities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, an affiliate 
of the Funds, and Goldman Sachs serve as lending agents pursuant to the JPMorgan 
Agreement and the Goldman Sachs Agreement, respectively. 
Under the Goldman Sachs Agreement 
and the JPMorgan Agreement, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase Bank, respectively, 
acting as agents for certain of the Funds, loan securities to approved borrowers 
pursuant to Borrower Agreements substantially in the form approved by the Board 
of Trustees in exchange for collateral. During the term of the loan, the Fund 
receives payments from borrowers equivalent to the dividends and interest that 
would have been earned on securities lent while simultaneously seeking to earn 
income on the investment of cash collateral in accordance with investment 
guidelines contained in the JPMorgan Agreement or the Goldman Sachs Agreement. 
The Fund retains the interest on cash collateral investments but is required to 
pay the borrower a rebate for the use of cash collateral. The net income earned 
on the securities lending (after payment of rebates and the lending agent’s fee) 
is included in the Statement of Operations as income from securities lending 
(net in the 
 
Part II - 102 


Fund’s financial statements). 
Information on the investment of cash collateral is shown in the Schedule of 
Portfolio Investments (in the Fund’s financial statements). 
Under the Goldman Sachs Agreement, 
Goldman Sachs is entitled to a fee equal to a percentage of the earnings on 
loans of securities. For purposes of this calculation, earnings shall mean: 
(a) the earnings on investments of cash collateral including waivers and 
reimbursements made by the Fund’s adviser or its affiliates for the benefit of 
the Fund that are related solely to investments of cash collateral less 
(b) the cash collateral fees paid to borrowers in connection with cash 
collateral. Pursuant to the Third Party Securities Lending Agreement, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank’s compensation is paid by Goldman Sachs. Under the JPMorgan 
Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank is entitled to a fee, monthly in arrears, equal 
to (i) 0.03% of the average dollar value of loans of U.S. securities 
outstanding during a given month; and (ii) 0.09% of the average dollar 
value of loans of non-U.S. securities 
outstanding during a given month. The purpose of these fees under the JPMorgan 
Agreement is to cover the custodial, administrative and related costs of 
securities lending including securities movement, settlement of trades involving 
cash received as collateral, custody of collateral and marking to market loans. 

CUSTODIAN 
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated 
Global Custody and Fund Accounting Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, 270 Park 
Avenue, New York, New York 10017 (the “JPMorgan Custody Agreement”), JPMorgan 
Chase Bank serves as the custodian and fund accounting agent for each of the 
Funds, other than the JPMorgan SR Funds. Pursuant to the JPMorgan Custody 
Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank is responsible for holding portfolio securities 
and cash and maintaining the books of account and records of portfolio 
transactions. JPMorgan Chase Bank is an affiliate of the Advisers, the 
Administrator and JPMDS. 
With respect to the JPMorgan SR 
Funds, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Global Custody and Fund Accounting 
Agreement between the Administrator, JPMT I on behalf of the JPMorgan SR Funds, 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017, effective 
September 1, 2010 (the “SR Custody Agreement”), JPMorgan Chase Bank serves 
as the custodian and funds accounting agent and is responsible for holding 
portfolio securities and cash and maintaining the books of account and records 
of portfolio transactions. The fees and expenses under the SR Custody Agreement 
for custody and fund accounting are paid by JPMIM. 
CUSTODY AND FUND ACCOUNTING FEES AND EXPENSES 

For custodian services, each Fund 
(other than the JPMorgan SR Funds, as defined below) pays to JPMorgan Chase Bank 
annual safekeeping fees of between 0.0006% and 0.35% of assets held by JPMorgan 
Chase Bank (depending on the domicile in which the asset is held), calculated 
monthly in arrears and fees between $2.50 and $80 for securities trades 
(depending on the domicile in which the trade is settled), as well as 
transaction fees on certain activities of $2.50 to $20 per transaction. JPMorgan 
Chase Bank is also reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket or incidental 
expenses, including, but not limited to, registration and transfer fees and 
related legal fees. 
For custodian services for the 
JPMorgan SmartRetirement Funds other than the JPMorgan SmartRetirement Blend 
Funds (the “JPMorgan SR Funds”), JPMIM1 pays to JPMorgan Chase Bank annual 
safekeeping fees of between 0.0006% and 0.35% of assets held by JPMorgan Chase 
Bank (depending on the domicile in which the asset is held) calculated monthly 
in arrears. JPMIM also pays JPMorgan Chase Bank fees between $2.50 and $80 for 
securities trades (depending on the domicile in which the trade is settled), as 
well as transaction fees on certain activities of $2.50 to $20 per transaction. 
JPMIM shall also pay JPMorgan Chase Bank’s reasonable out-of-pocket or 
incidental expenses including, but not limited to, registration and transfer 
fees and related legal fees. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank may also be paid 
$15, $35 or $60 per proxy (depending on the country where the issuer is located) 
for its service which helps facilitate the voting of proxies throughout the 
world. For securities in the U.S. market, this fee is waived if the Adviser 
votes the proxies directly. 
With respect to fund accounting 
services, the following schedule shall be employed in the calculation of the 
fees payable for the services provided under the JPMorgan Custody Agreement and 
the SR Custody Agreement. For purposes of determining the asset levels at which 
a tier applies, assets for that fund type across the entire J.P. Morgan Funds 
Complex shall be used.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank 
provides derivative servicing, including, with respect to swaps, swaptions and 
bond and currency options. The fees for these services include a transaction fee 
of $25 or $150 per new contract (depending on whether the transaction is 
electronic or manual), a fee of up to $25 or $150 per contract amendment 
(including transactions such as trade amendments, cancellations, terminations,

daily fee of $0.40 per contract for position management services. In addition a 
Fund will pay a fee of $2.00 to $5.30 per day for the valuation of the 
derivative positions covered by these services. 
Pursuant to an arrangement with 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, custodian fees may be reduced by amounts calculated as a 
percentage of uninvested balances for certain Funds. 
The Fund and/or its Cayman 
subsidiary, as applicable, may at times hold some of their assets in cash, which 
may subject the Fund and/or the Cayman subsidiary, as applicable, to additional 
risks and costs, such as increased credit exposure to the custodian bank and 
fees imposed for cash balances. Cash positions may also hurt the Fund’s and/or 
the Cayman subsidiary’s performance. 
TRANSFER AGENT 
Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. 
(“BFDS” or “Transfer Agent”), 2000 Crown Colony Drive, Quincy, MA 02169, serves 
as each Fund’s transfer and dividend disbursing agent. As transfer agent and 
dividend disbursing agent, BFDS is responsible for maintaining account records, 
detailing the ownership of Fund shares and for crediting income, capital gains 
and other changes in share ownership to shareholder accounts. 
SHAREHOLDER SERVICING 
The Trusts, on behalf of the Funds, 
have entered into a shareholder servicing agreement, effective February 19, 
2005, with JPMDS (“Shareholder Servicing Agreement”). Under the Shareholder 
Servicing Agreement, JPMDS will provide, or cause its agents to provide, any 
combination of the (i) personal shareholder liaison services and 
shareholder account information services (“Shareholder Services”) described

For details of fees paid by the 
Funds to JPMDS for Shareholder Services and Other Related Services under the 
Shareholder Servicing Agreement, see “SHAREHOLDER SERVICING — Shareholder 
Services Fees” in Part I of this SAI. 
To the extent it is not otherwise 
required by its contractual agreement to limit a Fund’s expenses as described in 
the Prospectuses for the Funds, JPMDS may voluntarily agree from time to time to 
waive a portion of the fees payable to it under the Shareholder Servicing 
Agreement with respect to each Fund on a month-to-month basis. 
If not terminated, the Shareholder 
Servicing Agreement will continue for successive one year terms beyond 
October 31 of each year, provided that such continuance is specifically 
approved at least annually by the vote of a majority of those members of the 
Board of Trustees of the Trusts who are not parties to the Shareholder Servicing 
Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party. 
The Shareholder Servicing Agreement may be terminated without penalty, on not 
less than 60 days’ prior written notice, by the Board of Trustees of the Trusts 
or by JPMDS. The Shareholder Servicing Agreement will also terminate 
automatically in the event of its assignment. 
JPMDS may enter into service 
agreements with Financial Intermediaries under which it will pay all or a 
portion of such fees received from the Funds to such entities for performing 
Shareholder Services and/or Other Related Services, as described above, for 
shareholders. Such Financial Intermediaries may include affiliates of JPMDS. 

JPMDS, JPMIM or their affiliates may 
from time to time, at its or their own expense, out of compensation retained by 
them from the Funds or from other sources available to them, make additional 
payments to certain Financial Intermediaries for performing “Other Related 
Services” for their customers. These services include the services listed in 
paragraph beginning “Other Related Services” above. Such compensation does not 
represent an additional expense to the Funds or to their shareholders, since it 
will be paid by JPMDS, JPMIM or their affiliates. 
For shareholders that bank with 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank may aggregate investments in the Funds 
with balances held in JPMorgan Chase Bank accounts for purposes of determining 
eligibility for certain bank privileges that are based on specified minimum 
balance requirements, such as reduced or no fees for certain banking services or 
preferred rates on loans and deposits. 
JPMDS, the Funds and their 
affiliates, agents and subagents may share certain information about 
shareholders and their accounts, as permitted by law and as described in the 
J.P. Morgan Funds Privacy Policy provided with your shareholder report, and also 
available on the J.P. Morgan Funds website at www.jpmorganfunds.com. 
EXPENSES 
Except for the JPMorgan SR Funds, 
the Funds pay the expenses incurred in their operations, including their pro-rata share of expenses of the Trusts. 
These expenses include: investment advisory and administrative fees; the 
compensation of the Trustees; registration fees; interest charges; taxes; 
expenses connected with the execution, 
 
Part II - 105 


recording and settlement of security 
transactions; fees and expenses of the Funds’ custodian for all services to the 
Funds, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required 
books and accounts; expenses of preparing and mailing reports to investors and 
to government offices and commissions; expenses of meetings of investors; fees 
and expenses of independent accountants, legal counsel and any transfer agent, 
registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trusts; insurance premiums; and 
expenses of calculating the NAV of, and the net income on, shares of the Funds. 
Shareholder servicing and distribution fees are all allocated to specific 
classes of the Funds. In addition, the Funds may allocate transfer agency and 
certain other expenses by class. Service providers to a Fund may, from time to 
time, voluntarily waive all or a portion of any fees to which they are entitled 
and/or reimburse certain expenses as they may determine from time to time. A 
Fund’s service providers may discontinue or modify these voluntary actions at 
any time without notice. Performance for certain Funds reflects the voluntary 
waiver of fees and/or the reimbursement of expenses. Without these voluntary 
waivers and/or expense reimbursements, performance would have been less 
favorable. 
With respect to the JPMorgan SR 
Funds, the Administrator pays many of the ordinary expenses incurred by the 
Funds in their operations including organization costs, taxes, ordinary fees and 
expenses for legal and auditing services, fees and expenses of pricing services, 
the expenses of preparing (including typesetting), printing and mailing reports, 
prospectuses, statements of additional information, proxy solicitation material 
and notices to existing shareholders, all expenses incurred in connection with 
issuing and redeeming shares, the cost of custodial and fund accounting 
services, and the cost of initial and ongoing registration of the shares under 
Federal and state securities laws. The Funds pay the following fees and 
expenses, including their pro-rata 
share of the following fees and expenses of the Trust: (1) transfer agency, 
(2) shareholder servicing, (3) distribution fees, (4) brokerage 
costs, (5) all fees and expenses of Trustees, (6) the portion of the 
compensation of the Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) attributable to the 
Funds on the basis of relative net assets, (7) costs of the Trust’s CCO 
Program, (8) insurance, including fidelity bond and D&O insurance, 
(9) interest, (10) litigation and (11) other extraordinary or 
nonrecurring expenses. Shareholder servicing and distribution fees are allocated 
to specific classes of the Funds. Service providers to the Funds may, from time 
to time, voluntarily waive all or a portion of any fees to which they are 
entitled. 
JPMIM, JPMAAM and JPMDS have agreed 
that they will waive fees or reimburse the Funds, as applicable, as described in 
the Prospectuses. 
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES 
As described in “SHAREHOLDER 
SERVICING” in this SAI, JPMDS may enter into service agreements with 
Financial Intermediaries under which it will pay all or a portion of the 
shareholder servicing fees it receives from the Funds to such Financial 
Intermediaries for performing Shareholder Services and/or Other Related Services 
for Financial Intermediaries’ customers who are shareholders of the Funds. In 
addition, as described in “DISTRIBUTION PLAN” in this SAI, JPMDS may 
enter into Mutual Fund Sales Agreements with Financial Intermediaries under 
which it will pay all or a portion of the Distribution Fees it receives from the 
Funds to such Financial Intermediaries for providing distribution services and 
marketing support. 
In addition, the Funds may enter 
into agreements with Financial Intermediaries pursuant to which the Funds will 
pay the Financial Intermediary for services such as networking, or sub-transfer 
agency and/or omnibus sub-accounting (collectively, “Omnibus Sub-Accounting”) or 
networking. Payments made pursuant to such agreements are generally based on 
either (1) a percentage of the average daily net assets of clients serviced 
by such Financial Intermediary up to a set maximum dollar amount per shareholder 
account serviced, or (2) the number of accounts serviced by such Financial 
Intermediary. Any payments made pursuant to such agreements are in addition to, 
rather than in lieu of, Rule 12b-1 fees and shareholder servicing fees the 
Financial Intermediary may also be receiving pursuant to agreements with the 
Distributor and shareholder servicing agent, respectively. From time to time, 
JPMDS, JPMIM or their affiliates may pay a portion of the fees for networking or 
Omnibus Sub-Accounting at its or their own expense out of its or their own 
legitimate profits. 
Financial Intermediaries may offer 
additional services to their customers, including specialized procedures and 
payment for the purchase and redemption of Fund shares, such as pre-authorized 
or systematic purchase and redemption programs, “sweep” programs, cash advances 
and redemption checks. Certain Financial Intermediaries may (although they are 
not required by the Trusts to do so) credit to the accounts of their customers 
from whom they are already receiving other fees amounts not exceeding such other 
fees or the fees for their services as Financial Intermediaries. 
 
Part II - 106 


Financial Intermediaries may 
establish their own terms and conditions for providing their services and may 
charge investors a transaction-based or other fee for their services. Such 
charges may vary among Financial Intermediaries, but in all cases will be 
retained by the Financial Intermediary and will not be remitted to a Fund or 
JPMDS. 
Certain Funds have authorized one or 
more Financial Intermediaries to accept purchase and redemption orders on their 
behalf. Such Financial Intermediaries are authorized to designate other 
intermediaries to accept purchase and redemption orders on a Fund’s behalf. Such 
Funds will be deemed to have received a purchase or redemption order when a 
Financial Intermediary or, if applicable, that Financial Intermediary’s 
authorized designee accepts the order. These orders will be priced at the Fund’s 
NAV next calculated after they are so accepted. 
Effective April 3, 2017, the Funds 
will cease making direct payments to Financial Intermediaries for any applicable 
sub-transfer agency services. After this date, payments to Financial 
Intermediaries for sub-transfer agency services will be made by JPMDS from the 
service fee (formerly known as “shareholder service fee”). From time to time, 
JPMIM or its affiliates may pay a portion of the sub-transfer agency fees at its 
or their own expense and out of its or their legitimate profits. 
ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION TO FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES 

JPMDS, JPMIM and JPMAAM at their own 
expense out of their own legitimate profits, may provide additional compensation 
(“Additional Compensation”) to Financial Intermediaries. Additional Compensation 
may also be paid by other affiliates of JPMDS, JPMIM and JPMAAM from time to 
time. These Additional Compensation payments are over and above any sales 
charges (including Rule 12b-1 fees), shareholder servicing, Omnibus 
Sub-Accounting or networking fees which are charged directly to the Funds and 
which are disclosed elsewhere in the Funds’ prospectuses or in this SAI. The 
categories of Additional Compensation are described below. These categories are 
not mutually exclusive and JPMDS, JPMIM, JPMAAM and/or their affiliates may pay 
additional types of Additional Compensation in the future. The same Financial 
Intermediaries may receive payments under more than one or all categories. Not 
all Financial Intermediaries receive Additional Compensation payments and such 
payments may be different for different Financial Intermediaries or different 
types of funds (e.g., equity fund or fixed income fund). These payments may be 
significant to a Financial Intermediary and may be an important factor in a 
Financial Intermediary’s willingness to support the sale of the Funds through 
its distribution system. Additional Compensation payments are always made only 
to the firm, never to individuals other than occasional gifts and entertainment 
that are permitted by FINRA rules. 
JPMIM, JPMDS, JPMAAM and/or their 
affiliates may be motivated to pay Additional Compensation to promote the sale 
of Fund shares to clients of Financial Intermediaries and the retention of those 
investments by those clients. To the extent Financial Intermediaries sell more 
shares of the Funds or retain shares of the Funds in their clients’ accounts, 
JPMIM, JPMDS and JPMAAM benefit from the incremental management and other fees 
paid by the Funds with respect to those assets. 
The provision of Additional 
Compensation, the varying fee structure and the basis on which a Financial 
Intermediary compensates its registered representatives or salespersons may 
create an incentive for a particular Financial Intermediary, registered 
representative or salesperson to highlight, feature or recommend funds, 
including the Funds, or other investments based, at least in part, on the level 
of compensation paid. Additionally, if one mutual fund sponsor makes greater 
distribution payments than another, a Financial Intermediary may have an 
incentive to recommend that sponsor’s mutual fund over other mutual funds. 
Similarly, if a Financial Intermediary receives greater compensation for one 
share class versus another, that Financial Intermediary may have an incentive to 
recommend that share class. Shareholders should consider whether such incentives 
exist when evaluating any recommendations from a Financial Intermediary to 
purchase or sell shares of the Funds and when considering which share class is 
most appropriate. Shareholders should ask their salesperson or visit their 
Financial Intermediary’s website for more information. 
Sales and Marketing 
Support. Additional Compensation may be paid to Financial 
Intermediaries for sales and marketing support. Marketing support may include 
access to a Financial Intermediary’s sales representatives and management 
representatives. Additional Compensation may also be paid to Financial 
Intermediaries for inclusion of the Funds on a firm’s list of offered products 
including a preferred or select sales list, in other sales programs or as an 
expense reimbursement. Additional Compensation may be calculated in basis points 
based on average net Fund assets attributable to the Financial Intermediary or 
sales of the Funds by the Financial Intermediary. Additional Compensation may 
also be fixed dollar amounts. 
From time to time, JPMIM, JPMDS, 
JPMAAM and their affiliates may provide, out of their own legitimate profits, 
financial assistance to Financial Intermediaries that enable JPMDS, JPMIM and 
JPMAAM to sponsor and/or 
 
Part II - 107 


participate in and/or present at 
meeting, conferences or seminars, sales, training or educational programs, 
client and investor events, client prospecting retention, and due diligence 
events and other firm-sponsored events or other programs for the Financial 
Intermediaries’ registered representatives and employees. These payments may 
vary depending upon the nature of the event, and may include travel expenses, 
such as lodging incurred by registered representatives of the Financial 
Intermediaries. In addition, JPMIM, JPMDS, JPMAAM and their affiliates may pay 
or reimburse sales representatives of Financial Intermediaries in the form of 
occasional gifts and occasional meals or entertainment events that JPMIM, JPMDS, 
JPMAAM or their affiliates deem appropriate, subject to applicable law and 
regulations. Other compensation may be offered to the extent not prohibited by 
federal or state laws or any self-regulatory agency, such as FINRA. These 
payments may vary depending upon the nature of the event or the relationship. 

Administrative and Processing 
Support. JPMIM, JPMDS and/or JPMAAM may also pay Additional Compensation 
to Financial Intermediaries for their administrative and processing support, 
including (i) record keeping, Omnibus Sub-Accounting and networking, to the extent 
that the Funds do not pay for these costs directly; (ii) reimbursement for 
ticket processing charges applied to Fund shares and (iii) one time 
payments for ancillary services such as setting up Funds on the Financial 
Intermediary’s mutual fund trading system/platform. 
Identification of Financial 
Intermediaries 
The following is a list of FINRA 
member firms that received Additional Compensation for the period ending 
September 30, 2016. This list includes FINRA members: (1) who have entered 
into to written agreements with the Funds’ Adviser to receive Additional 
Compensation (excluding payments made for Omnibus Sub-Accounting services); 
and/or (2) who have received Additional Compensation for events and 
meetings that were sponsored in whole or in part by JPMDS.

TRUST COUNSEL 
The law firm of Dechert LLP, 1095 
Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036-6797, is counsel to the Trusts. 

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The independent registered public 
accounting firm for the Trusts and the Funds is PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 
Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP conducts an 
annual audit of the financial statements of each of the Funds and assists in the 
preparation and/or review of each Fund’s federal and state income tax returns. 

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
Each Fund declares and pays 
dividends and distributions as described under “Distribution and Tax Matters” in 
the Prospectuses. Dividends may differ between classes as a result of 
differences in distribution expenses or other class-specific expenses. 

Dividends and capital gains 
distributions paid by a Fund are automatically reinvested in additional shares 
of the Fund unless the shareholder has elected to have them paid in cash. 
Dividends and distributions to be paid in cash are credited to the shareholder’s 
pre-assigned bank account or are mailed 
by check in accordance with the customer’s instructions. The Funds reserve the 
right to discontinue, alter or limit the automatic reinvestment privilege at any 
time. 
If a shareholder has elected to 
receive dividends and/or capital gain distributions in cash and the postal or 
other delivery service is unable to deliver checks to the shareholder’s address 
of record, such shareholder’s distribution option will automatically be 
converted to having all dividend and other distributions reinvested in 
additional shares. No interest will accrue on amounts represented by uncashed 
distribution or redemption checks. With regard to Funds that accrue dividends 
daily, dividends will only begin to accrue after a Fund receives payment for 
shares. 
 
Part II - 110 


NET 
ASSET VALUE 
Shares are sold at NAV per share, 
plus a sales charge, if any. This is also known as the offering price. Shares 
are also redeemed at NAV, minus any applicable deferred sales charges. Each 
class of shares in each Fund has a different NAV. This is primarily because each 
class has class specific expenses such as distribution and shareholder servicing 
fees. 
The NAV per share of a class of a 
Fund is equal to the value of all the assets attributable to that class, minus 
the liabilities attributable to that class, divided by the number of outstanding 
shares of that class. The Money Market Funds, excluding Prime Money Market Fund, 
will continue to value their portfolio of securities using the amortized cost 
method provided that certain conditions are met, including that the Fund’s Board 
of Trustees continues to believe that the amortized cost valuation fairly 
reflects the market-based NAV per share of the Fund. The purpose of this method 
of calculation is to attempt to maintain a constant NAV per share of each Fund 
of $1.00. No assurances can be given that this goal can be attained. The 
amortized cost method of valuation values a security at its cost at the time of 
purchase and thereafter assumes an amortization that would produce a constant 
yield to maturity of any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of 
fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument. The Board of 
Trustees has established procedures and directed certain officers of the Funds 
to monitor the differences between the NAVs calculated based on amortized cost 
and market value at predetermined intervals but no less frequently than weekly, 
and to report to the Board of Trustees such differences. If a difference of more 
than 1/2 of 1% occurs between valuation based on the amortized cost method and 
valuation based on market value, the Board of Trustees may take steps necessary 
to reduce such deviation if it believes that such deviation will result in 
material dilution or any unfair results to investors or existing shareholders. 
Actions that may be taken by the Board of Trustees include (i) redeeming 
shares in kind, (ii) selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to 
realize capital gains or losses or to shorten the average maturity of portfolio 
securities, (iii) withholding or supplementing dividends 
(iv) utilizing a net asset value per share as determined by using available 
market quotations, or (v) reducing the number of outstanding Fund shares. 
Any reduction of outstanding shares will be accomplished by having each 
shareholder contribute to a Fund’s capital the necessary shares on a pro rata 
basis. Each shareholder will be deemed to have agreed to such contribution in 
these circumstances by his or her investment in the Funds. In its discretion, 
the Board of Trustees of the Money Market Funds may elect to calculate the price 
of a Fund’s shares once per day. Further, with regard to the Money Market Funds, 
the Board of Trustees has empowered management to temporarily suspend one or 
more cut-off times for a Fund, other than the last cut-off time of the day. 

The NAV of each class of shares of 
the Prime Money Market Fund is calculated using market-based values. The 
following is a discussion of the procedures used by the Funds in valuing their 
assets for market-based NAVs. 
Securities for which market 
quotations are readily available are generally valued at their current market 
value. Other securities and assets, including securities for which market 
quotations are not readily available; market quotations are determined not to be 
reliable; or, their value has been materially affected by events occurring after 
the close of trading on the exchange or market on which the security is 
principally traded (for example, a natural disaster affecting an entire country 
or region, or an event that affects an individual company) but before a Fund’s 
NAV is calculated, may be valued at its fair value in accordance with policies 
and procedures adopted by the J.P. Morgan Funds’ Board of Trustees. Fair value 
represents a good faith determination of the value of a security or other asset 
based upon specifically applied procedures. Fair valuation determinations may 
require subjective determinations. There can be no assurance that the fair value 
of an asset is the price at which the asset could have been sold during the 
period in which the particular fair value was used in determining the Fund’s 
NAV. 
Equity securities listed on a North 
American, Central American, South American or Caribbean (“Americas”) securities 
exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which 
the security is principally traded that is reported before the time when the net 
assets of the Funds are valued. The value of securities listed on the NASDAQ 
Stock Market, Inc. is generally the NASDAQ official closing price. 
Generally, trading of foreign equity 
securities on most foreign markets (i.e., non-Western hemisphere) is completed 
before the close in trading in U.S. markets. The Funds have implemented fair 
value pricing on a daily basis for all foreign equity securities and investments 
with foreign equity reference obligations. The fair value pricing utilizes the 
quotations of an independent pricing service. Trading on foreign markets may 
also take place on days on which the U.S. markets and the Funds are closed. 

Shares of exchange-traded funds 
(ETFs) are generally valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which the 
ETF is principally traded. Shares of open-end mutual funds are valued at their 
respective NAVs. 
 
Part II - 111 


Fixed income securities are valued 
using market quotations supplied by approved independent third party pricing 
services, affiliated pricing services or broker/dealers. In determining security 
prices, pricing services and broker/dealers may consider a variety of inputs and 
factors, including, but not limited to proprietary models that may take into 
account market transactions in securities with comparable characteristics, yield 
curves, option-adjusted spreads, credit spreads, estimated default rates, coupon 
rates, underlying collateral and estimated cash flows. 
Assets and liabilities initially 
expressed in foreign currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the 
prevailing market rates from an approved independent pricing service as of 4:00 
PM ET. 
Options (e.g., on stock indices or 
equity securities) traded on U.S. equity securities exchanges are valued at the 
composite mean price, using the National Best Bid and Offer quotes at the close 
of options trading on such exchanges. 
Options traded on foreign exchanges 
or U.S. commodity exchanges are valued at the settled price, or if no settled 
price is available, at the last sale price available prior to the calculation of 
a Fund’s NAV. 
Exchange traded futures (e.g., on 
stock indices, debt securities or commodities) are valued at the settled price, 
or if no settled price is available, at the last sale price as of the close of 
the exchanges on which they trade. 
Non-listed over-the-counter options 
and futures are valued at the evaluated price provided by a counterparty or 
broker/dealer. 
Swaps and structured notes are 
priced generally by an approved independent third party or affiliated pricing 
service or at an evaluated price provided by a counterparty or broker/dealer. 

Certain fixed income securities and 
swaps may be valued using market quotations or valuations provided by pricing 
services affiliated with the Adviser. Valuations received by the Funds from 
affiliated pricing services are the same as those provided to other affiliated 
and unaffiliated entities by these affiliated pricing services. 
With respect to all Funds, 
securities or other assets for which market quotations are not readily available 
or for which market quotations do not represent the value at the time of pricing 
(including certain illiquid securities) are fair valued in accordance with 
policies and procedures (“Policies”) established by and under the supervision 
and responsibility of the Trustees. The Board of Trustees has established an 
Audit and Valuation Committee to assist the Board of Trustees in its oversight 
of the valuation of the Funds’ securities and delegated to J.P. Morgan 
Investment Management Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. (the “Administrator” or “JPMIM”), the responsibility for 
implementing the day-to-day operational aspects of the valuation process. The 
Administrator has created the J.P. Morgan Asset Management (“JPMAM”) Americas 
Valuation Committee (“VC”) to oversee and carry out the Policies for the 
valuation of investments held in the Funds. The VC is comprised of senior 
representatives from JPMIM, JPMAM Legal, Compliance and Risk Management and the 
Funds’ Chief Compliance Officer. Fair value situations could include, but are 
not limited to: (1) a significant event that affects the value of a Fund’s 
securities (e.g., news relating to natural disasters affecting an issuer’s 
operations or earnings announcements); (2) illiquid securities; 
(3) securities that may be defaulted or de-listed from an exchange and are 
no longer trading; or (4) any other circumstance in which the VC believes 
that market quotations do not accurately reflect the value of a security. 

From time to time, there may be 
errors in the calculation of the NAV of a Fund or the processing of purchases 
and redemptions. Shareholders will generally not be notified of the occurrence 
of an error or the resolution thereof. 
DELAWARE TRUSTS 
JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and 
JPMT IV. JPMT I and JPMT II were each formed as Delaware statutory trusts on 
November 12, 2004 pursuant to separate Declarations of Trust dated 
November 5, 2004. JPMT I assumed JPMMFS’ registration pursuant to the 1933 
Act and the 1940 Act effective after the close of business on February 18, 
2005, and JPMT II assumed One Group Mutual Funds’ registration pursuant to 
the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act effective after the close of business on 
February 18, 2005. JPMT III was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on 
November 14, 2013 pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated November 13, 
2013. JPMT IV was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on November 11, 2015 
pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated November 11, 2015. 
Under Delaware law, shareholders of 
a statutory trust shall have the same limitation of personal liability that is 
extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under 
Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the trust’s governing trust 
instrument. JPMT I’s, JPMT II’s, JPMT III’s, and JPMT IV’s Declarations of Trust 
each provides that shareholders of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV shall 
not be personally liable for the 
 
Part II - 112 


debts, liabilities, obligations and 
expenses incurred by, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to JPMT 
I, JPMT II, JPMT III, and JPMT IV or any series or class thereof. In 
addition, the Declarations of Trust each provides that neither JPMT I, JPMT II, 
JPMT III, JPMT IV, nor the Trustees, officers, employees, nor agents thereof 
shall have any power to bind personally any shareholders nor to call upon any 
shareholder for payment of any sum of money or assessment other than such as the 
shareholder may personally agree to pay. Moreover, Declarations of Trust for 
JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV each expressly provide that the 
shareholders shall have the same limitation of personal liability that is 
extended to shareholders of a private corporation for profit incorporated in the 
State of Delaware. 
The Declarations of Trust of JPMT I 
and JPMT II each provides for the indemnification out of the assets held with 
respect to a particular series of shares of any shareholder or former 
shareholder held personally liable solely by reason of a claim or demand 
relating to the person being or having been a shareholder and not because of the 
shareholder’s acts or omissions. The Declarations of Trust of JPMT I and JPMT II 
each also provide that JPMT I and JPMT II, on behalf of the applicable series, 
may, at its option with prior written notice, assume the defense of any claim 
made against a shareholder. 
JPMT I’s, JPMT II’s, JPMT III’s, and 
JPMT IV’s Declarations of Trust each provides that JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and 
JPMT IV will indemnify their respective Trustees and officers against 
liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in which 
they may be involved because of their offices with JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III or 
JPMT IV, unless, as to liability to JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III or JPMT IV, or the 
shareholders thereof, the Trustees engaged in willful misfeasance, bad faith, 
gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of 
their offices. In addition, the Declarations of Trust each provides that any 
Trustee who has been determined to be an “audit committee financial expert” 
shall not be subject to a greater liability or duty of care because of such 
determination. 
JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT 
IV shall continue without limitation of time subject to the provisions in the 
Declarations of Trust concerning termination by action of the shareholders or by 
action of the Trustees upon written notice to the shareholders. 
JPMT I is party to an Agreement and 
Plan of Investment and Transfer of Assets dated January 17, 2006 pursuant 
to which it has agreed, out of the assets and property of certain Funds, to 
indemnify and hold harmless JPMorgan Chase Bank, in its corporate capacity and 
as trustee of certain common trust funds, and each of its directors and 
officers, for any breach by JPMT I of its representations, warranties, covenants 
or agreements under such Agreement or any act, error, omission, neglect, 
misstatement, materially misleading statement, breach of duty or other act 
wrongfully done or attempted to be committed by JPMT I or its Board of Trustees 
or officers, related to the transfer of assets from certain common trust funds 
to the respective Funds and other related transactions. 
MASSACHUSETTS TRUST 
JPMMFIT. JPMMFIT is organized 
as a Massachusetts business trust. The Growth Advantage Fund is a separate and 
distinct series of JPMMFIT. Copies of the Declarations of Trust of JPMMFIT is on 
file in the office of the Secretary of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The 
Declarations of Trust and By-laws of 
JPMMFIT is designed to make JPMMFIT similar in most respects to a Massachusetts 
business corporation. The principal distinction between the two forms concerns 
shareholder liability as described below. 
Under Massachusetts law, 
shareholders of such a trust may, under certain circumstances, be held 
personally liable as partners for the obligations of the trust, which is not the 
case for a corporation. However, JPMMFIT’s Declarations of Trust provide that 
the shareholders shall not be subject to any personal liability for the acts or 
obligations of the Fund and that every written agreement, obligation, instrument 
or undertaking made on behalf of the Fund shall contain a provision to the 
effect that the shareholders are not personally liable thereunder. 
No personal liability will attach to 
the shareholders under any undertaking containing such provision when adequate 
notice of such provision is given, except possibly in a few jurisdictions. With 
respect to all types of claims in the latter jurisdictions, (i) tort 
claims, (ii) contract claims where the provision referred to is omitted 
from the undertaking, (iii) claims for taxes, and (iv) certain 
statutory liabilities in other jurisdictions, a shareholder may be held 
personally liable to the extent that claims are not satisfied by the Funds. 
However, upon payment of such liability, the shareholder will be entitled to 
reimbursement from the general assets of the Funds. The Boards of Trustees 
intend to conduct the operations of JPMMFIT in such a way so as to avoid, as far 
as possible, ultimate liability of the shareholders for liabilities of the 
Funds. 
JPMMIT’s Declarations of Trust 
provides that JPMMFIT will indemnify their Trustees and officers against 
liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with litigation in which they 
may be involved because of their offices 
 
Part II - 113 


with JPMMFIT, unless, as to 
liability to JPMMFIT or their shareholders, it is finally adjudicated that the 
Trustees engaged in willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless 
disregard of the duties involved in their offices or with respect to any matter 
unless it is finally adjudicated that they did not act in good faith in the 
reasonable belief that their actions were in the best interests of JPMMFIT. In 
the case of settlement, such indemnification will not be provided unless it has 
been determined by a court or other body approving the settlement or other 
disposition, or by a reasonable determination based upon a review of readily 
available facts, by vote of a majority of disinterested Trustees or in a written 
opinion of independent counsel, that such officers or Trustees have not engaged 
in willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of 
their duties. 
JPMMFIT shall continue without 
limitation of time subject to the provisions in its Declarations of Trust 
concerning termination by action of the shareholders or by action of the 
Trustees upon notice to the shareholders. 
MARYLAND CORPORATION 
JPMFMFG. JPMFMFG is a diversified open-end management investment company which 
was organized as a Maryland corporation, on August 19, 1997. Effective 
April 30, 2003, the name of JPMFMFG was changed from Fleming Mutual Fund 
Group, Inc. to J.P. Morgan Fleming Mutual Fund Group, Inc. 
The Articles of Incorporation of 
JPMFMFG provide that a Director shall be liable only for his own willful 
defaults and, if reasonable care has been exercised in the selection of 
officers, agents, employees or investment advisers, shall not be liable for any 
neglect or wrongdoing of any such person. The Articles of Incorporation also 
provide that JPMFMFG will indemnify its Directors and officers against 
liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with actual or threatened 
litigation in which they may be involved because of their offices with JPMFMFG 
to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, nothing in the Articles of 
Incorporation shall protect or indemnify a Director against any liability for 
his willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of 
his duties. 
DESCRIPTION OF SHARES 
Shares of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV. 
JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV are open-end, management investment 
companies organized as Delaware statutory trusts. Each Fund represents a 
separate series of shares of beneficial interest. See “Delaware Trusts.” 

The Declarations of Trust of JPMT I, 
JPMT II JPMT III and JPMT IV each permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited 
number of full and fractional shares ($0.0001 par value) of one or more series 
and classes within any series and to divide or combine the shares of any series 
or class without materially changing the proportionate beneficial interest of 
such shares of such series or class in the assets held with respect to that 
series. Each share represents an equal beneficial interest in the net assets of 
a Fund with each other share of that Fund. The Trustees of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT 
III and JPMT IV may authorize the issuance of shares of additional series and 
the creation of classes of shares within any series with such preferences, 
voting powers, rights, duties and privileges as the Trustees may determine; 
however, the Trustees may not classify or change outstanding shares in a manner 
materially adverse to shareholders of each share. Upon liquidation of a Fund, 
shareholders are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets of a Fund 
available for distribution to such shareholders. The rights of redemption and 
exchange are described in the Prospectuses and elsewhere in this SAI. 

The shareholders of each Fund are 
entitled to one vote for each dollar of NAV (or a proportionate fractional vote 
with respect to the remainder of the NAV of shares, if any), on matters on which 
shares of a Fund shall be entitled to vote. Subject to the 1940 Act, the 
Trustees themselves have the power to alter the number and the terms of office 
of the Trustees, to lengthen their own terms, or to make their terms of 
unlimited duration subject to certain removal procedures, and appoint their own 
successors, provided, however, that immediately after such appointment the 
requisite majority of the Trustees have been elected by the shareholders of JPMT 
I, JPMT II, JPMT III or JPMT IV respectively. The voting rights of 
shareholders are not cumulative with respect to the election of Trustees. It is 
the intention of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV not to hold meetings of 
shareholders annually. The Trustees may call meetings of shareholders for action 
by shareholder vote as may be required by either the 1940 Act or the 
Declarations of Trust of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV. 
Each share of a series or class 
represents an equal proportionate interest in the assets in that series or class 
with each other share of that series or class. The shares of each series or 
class participate equally in the earnings, dividends and assets of the 
particular series or class. Expenses of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III and JPMT IV 
which are not attributable to a specific series or class are allocated among all 
of their series in a manner deemed by the Trustees to be 
 
Part II - 114 


fair and equitable. Shares have no 
pre-emptive or conversion rights, and 
when issued, are fully paid and non-assessable. Shares of each series or 
class generally vote together, except when required under federal securities 
laws to vote separately on matters that may affect a particular class, such as 
the approval of distribution plans for a particular class. 
The Trustees of JPMT I, JPMT II, 
JPMT III and JPMT IV may, without shareholder approval (unless otherwise 
required by applicable law): (i) cause JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III or JPMT 
IV, to merge or consolidate with or into one or more trusts (or series thereof 
to the extent permitted by law, partnerships, associations, corporations or 
other business entities (including trusts, partnerships, associations, 
corporations, or other business entities created by the Trustees to accomplish 
such merger or consolidation) so long as the surviving or resulting entity is an 
investment company as defined in the 1940 Act, or is a series thereof, that will 
succeed to or assume JPMT I’s, JPMT II’s, JPMT III’s or JPMT IV’s registration 
under the 1940 Act and that is formed, organized, or existing under the laws of 
the U.S. or of a state, commonwealth, possession or territory of the U.S., 
unless otherwise permitted under the 1940 Act; (ii) cause any one or more 
series or classes of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III or JPMT IV to merge or 
consolidate with or into any one or more other series or classes of JPMT I, JPMT 
II, JPMT III or JPMT IV one or more trusts (or series or classes thereof to the 
extent permitted by law), partnerships, associations, corporations; 
(iii) cause the shares to be exchanged under or pursuant to any state or 
federal statute to the extent permitted by law; or (iv) cause JPMT I, JPMT 
II, JPMT III or JPMT IV to reorganize as a corporation, limited liability 
company or limited liability partnership under the laws of Delaware or any other 
state or jurisdiction. However, the exercise of such authority may be subject to 
certain restrictions under the 1940 Act. 
The Trustees may, without 
shareholder vote, generally restate, amend or otherwise supplement JPMT I’s, 
JPMT II’s, JPMT III’s or JPMT IV’s governing instruments, including the 
Declarations of Trust and the By-Laws, 
without the approval of shareholders, subject to limited exceptions, such as the 
right to elect Trustees. 
The Trustees, without obtaining any 
authorization or vote of shareholders, may change the name of any series or 
class or dissolve or terminate any series or class of shares. 
Shares have no subscription or 
preemptive rights and only such conversion or exchange rights as the Board may 
grant in its discretion. When issued for payment as described in the Prospectus 
and this SAI, JPMT I’s, JPMT II’s, JPMT III’s or JPMT IV’s Shares will be 
fully paid and non-assessable. In the 
event of a liquidation or dissolution of JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III or JPMT IV 
Shares of a Fund are entitled to receive the assets available for distribution 
belonging to the Fund, and a proportionate distribution, based upon the relative 
asset values of the respective Funds, of any general assets not belonging to any 
particular Fund which are available for distribution. 
Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act provides that any 
matter required to be submitted to the holders of the outstanding voting 
securities of an investment company such as JPMT I, JPMT II, JPMT III or JPMT IV 
shall not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the 
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares of each Fund affected by the 
matter. For purposes of determining whether the approval of a majority of the 
outstanding Shares of a Fund will be required in connection with a matter, a 
Fund will be deemed to be affected by a matter unless it is clear that the 
interests of each Fund in the matter are identical, or that the matter does not 
affect any interest of the Fund. Under Rule 18f-2, the approval of an investment advisory 
agreement or any change in investment policy would be effectively acted upon 
with respect to a Fund only if approved by a majority of the outstanding Shares 
of such Fund. However, Rule 18f-2 also 
provides that the ratification of independent public accountants, the approval 
of principal underwriting contracts, and the election of Trustees may be 
effectively acted upon by Shareholders of the Trust voting without regard to 
series. 
Each share class of a Fund has 
exclusive voting rights with respect to matters pertaining to the Fund’s 
Distribution and Shareholder Services Plans, Distribution Plans or Shareholder 
Services Plan applicable to those classes. 
Shares of JPMMFIT. JPMMFIT is an open-end, 
management investment company which is organized as a Massachusetts business 
trust. The Growth Advantage Fund represents a separate series of shares of 
beneficial interest of JPMMFIT. See “Massachusetts Trust.” 
The Declaration of Trust of JPMMFIT 
permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares 
($0.001 par value) of one or more series and classes within any series and to 
divide or combine the shares (of any series, if applicable) without changing the 
proportionate beneficial interest of each shareholder in the Fund (or in the 
assets of other series, if applicable). Each share represents an equal 
proportional interest in the Fund with each other share. Upon liquidation of the 
Fund, holders are entitled to share pro-rata in the net assets of the Fund 
available for distribution to such shareholders. See “Massachusetts Trusts.” The 
rights of redemption and exchange are described in the Prospectuses and 
elsewhere in this SAI. 
 
Part II - 115 


The shareholders of the Fund are 
entitled to one vote for each whole share (with fractional shares entitled to a 
proportionate fractional vote) on matters on which shares of the Fund shall be 
entitled to vote. Subject to the 1940 Act, the Trustees themselves have the 
power to alter the number and the terms of office of the Trustees, to lengthen 
their own terms, or to make their terms of unlimited duration subject to certain 
removal procedures, and appoint their own successors, provided, however, that 
immediately after such appointment the requisite majority of the Trustees have 
been elected by the shareholders of JPMMFIT. The voting rights of shareholders 
are not cumulative so that holders of more than 50% of the shares voting can, if 
they choose, elect all Trustees being selected while the shareholders of the 
remaining shares would be unable to elect any Trustees. It is the intention of 
JPMMFIT not to hold meetings of shareholders annually. The Trustees may call 
meetings of shareholders for action by shareholder vote as may be required by 
either the 1940 Act or the Declarations of Trust. 
Each share of a series or class 
represents an equal proportionate interest in that series or class with each 
other share of that series or class. The shares of each series or class 
participate equally in the earnings, dividends and assets of the particular 
series or class. Expenses of JPMMFIT which are not attributable to a specific 
series or class are allocated among all of its series in a manner believed by 
management of JPMMFIT to be fair and equitable. Shares have no pre-emptive or conversion rights. Shares when 
issued are fully paid and non-assessable, except as set forth below. 
Shares of each series or class generally vote together, except when required 
under federal securities laws to vote separately on matters that may affect a 
particular class, such as the approval of distribution plans for a particular 
class. 
The Trustees may, however, authorize 
the issuance of shares of additional series and the creation of classes of 
shares within any series with such preferences, privileges, limitations and 
voting and dividend rights as the Trustees may determine. The proceeds from the 
issuance of any additional series would be invested in separate, independently 
managed Funds with distinct investment objectives, policies and restrictions, 
and share purchase, redemption and net asset valuation procedures. Any 
additional classes would be used to distinguish among the rights of different 
categories of shareholders, as might be required by future regulations or other 
unforeseen circumstances. All consideration received by the Fund for shares of 
any additional series or class, and all assets in which such consideration is 
invested, would belong to that series or class, subject only to the rights of 
creditors of the Fund and would be subject to the liabilities related thereto. 
Shareholders of any additional series or class will approve the adoption of any 
management contract or distribution plan relating to such series or class and of 
any changes in the investment policies related thereto, to the extent required 
by the 1940 Act. 
Shareholders of the Fund have the 
right, upon the declaration in writing or vote of more than two-thirds of its outstanding shares, to 
remove a Trustee. The Trustees will call a meeting of shareholders to vote on 
removal of a Trustee upon the written request of the record holders of 10% of 
the Fund’s shares. In addition, whenever ten or more shareholders of record who 
have been such for at least six months preceding the date of application, and 
who hold in the aggregate either shares having a NAV of at least $25,000 or at 
least 1% of JPMMFIT’s outstanding shares, whichever is less, shall apply to the 
Trustees in writing, stating that they wish to communicate with other 
shareholders with a view to obtaining signatures to request a meeting for the 
purpose of voting upon the question of removal of the Trustee or Trustees and 
accompanied by a form of communication and request which they wish to transmit, 
the Trustees shall within five business days after receipt of such application 
either: (1) afford to such applicants access to a list of the names and 
addresses of all shareholders as recorded on the books of the Trust; or 
(2) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of shareholders of 
record, and the approximate cost of mailing to them the proposed communication 
and form of request. If the Trustees elect to follow the latter course, the 
Trustees, upon the written request of such applicants, accompanied by a tender 
of the material to be mailed and of the reasonable expenses of mailing, shall, 
with reasonable promptness, mail such material to all shareholders of record at 
their addresses as recorded on the books, unless within five business days after 
such tender the Trustees shall mail to such applicants and file with the SEC, 
together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement signed by 
at least a majority of the Trustees to the effect that in their opinion either 
such material contains untrue statements of fact or omits to state facts 
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, or would be 
in violation of applicable law, and specifying the basis of such opinion. After 
opportunity for hearing upon the objections specified in the written statements 
filed, the SEC may, and if demanded by the Trustees or by such applicants shall, 
enter an order either sustaining one or more of such objections or refusing to 
sustain any of them. If the SEC shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of 
such objections, or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of 
such objections, the SEC shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, 
that all objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so 
declaring, the Trustees shall mail copies of such material to all shareholders 
with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such 
tender. 
 
 
Part II - 116 


For information relating to 
mandatory redemption of Fund shares or their redemption at the option of JPMMFIT 
under certain circumstances, see “Purchases, Redemptions and Exchanges”. 

Shares of JPMFMFG. The Articles of Incorporation 
of JPMFMFG, as supplemented, permit the classes of JPMFMFG to offer 
1,262,500,000 shares of common stock, with $.001 par value per share. Pursuant 
to JPMFMFG’s Articles of Incorporation, the Board may increase the number of 
shares that the classes of JPMFMFG are authorized to issue without the approval 
of the shareholders of each class of JPMFMFG. The Board of Directors has the 
power to designate and redesignate any authorized but unissued shares of capital 
stock into one or more classes of shares and separate series within each such 
class, to fix the number of shares in any such class or series and to classify 
or reclassify any unissued shares with respect to such class or series. 

Each share of a series in JPMFMFG 
represents an equal proportionate interest in that series with each other share. 
Shares are entitled upon liquidation to a pro rata share in the net assets of 
the series. Shareholders have no preemptive rights. All consideration received 
by JPMFMFG for shares of any series and all assets in which such consideration 
is invested would belong to that series and would be subject to the liabilities 
related thereto. Share certificates representing shares will not be issued. 

Under Maryland law, JPMFMFG is not 
required to hold an annual meeting of its shareholders unless required to do so 
under the 1940 Act. 
Each share in each series of the 
Fund represents an equal proportionate interest in that series of the Fund with 
each other share of that series of the Fund. The shares of each series and class 
participate equally in the earnings, dividends and assets of the particular 
series or class. Expenses of JPMFMFG which are not attributable to a specific 
series or class are allocated among all the series and classes in a manner 
believed by management of JPMFMFG to be fair and equitable. Shares of each 
series or class generally vote together, except when required by federal 
securities laws to vote separately on matters that may affect a particular 
series or class differently, such as approval of a distribution plan. 

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS DISCLOSURE 
As described in the Prospectuses and 
pursuant to the procedures approved by the Trustees, each business day, a Fund 
will make available to the public upon request to J.P. Morgan Funds Services or 
the J.P. Morgan Institutional Funds Service Center (1-800-480-4111 or 1-800-766-7722, as applicable) 
a complete, uncertified schedule of its portfolio holdings as of the prior 
business day for the Money Market Funds and as of the last day of that prior 
month for all other Funds. In addition, from time to time, each Fund may post 
portfolio holdings on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website on a more timely basis. 

The Funds’ publicly available 
uncertified, complete list of portfolio holdings information, as described 
above, may also be provided regularly pursuant to a standing request, such as on 
a monthly or quarterly basis, to (i) third party service providers, rating 
and ranking agencies, financial intermediaries, and affiliated persons of the 
Funds and (ii) clients of the Fund’s Adviser or its affiliates that invest 
in the Funds or such clients’ consultants. No compensation or other 
consideration is received by a Fund or the Fund’s Adviser, or any other person 
for these disclosures. 
For a list of the entities that 
receive the Funds’ portfolio holdings information, the frequency with which it 
is provided and the length of the lag between the date of the information and 
the date it is disclosed, see “PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS DISCLOSURE” in Part I of this 
SAI. 
In addition, certain service 
providers to the Funds or the Adviser, Administrator, Shareholder Servicing 
Agent or Distributor may for legitimate business purposes receive the Funds’ 
portfolio holdings information earlier than the time period specified in the 
applicable prospectus, such as sub-advisers, rating and ranking agencies, 
pricing services, proxy voting service providers, accountants, attorneys, 
custodians, securities lending agents, consultants retained to assist in the 
drafting of management discussion of fund performance in shareholder reports, 
brokers in connection with Fund transactions and in providing pricing 
quotations, transfer agents and entities providing CDSC financing (released 
weekly one day after trade date). When a Fund redeems a shareholder in kind, the 
shareholder generally receives its proportionate share of the Fund’s portfolio 
holdings and, therefore, the shareholder and its agent may receive such 
information earlier than the time period specified in the Prospectuses. Such 
holdings are released on conditions of confidentiality, which include 
appropriate trading prohibitions. “Conditions of confidentiality” include 
confidentiality terms included in written agreements, implied by the nature of 
the relationship (e.g., attorney–client relationship), or required by fiduciary 
or regulatory principles (e.g., custody services provided by financial 
institutions). 
 
Part II - 117 


Disclosure of a Fund’s portfolio 
securities as an exception to the Funds’ normal business practice requires the 
business unit proposing such exception to identify a legitimate business purpose 
for the disclosure and to submit the proposal to the Fund’s Treasurer for 
approval following business and legal review. Additionally, no compensation or 
other consideration is received by a Fund or the Fund’s Adviser, or any other 
person for these disclosures. The Funds’ Trustees will review annually a list of 
such entities that have received such information, the frequency of such 
disclosures and the business purpose therefor. These procedures are designed to 
address conflicts of interest between the Funds’ shareholders on the one hand 
and the Fund’s Adviser or any affiliated person of the Fund or such entities on 
the other hand by creating a structured review and approval process which seeks 
to ensure that disclosure of information about the Fund’s portfolio securities 
is in the best interests of the Fund’s shareholders. There can be no assurance, 
however, that a Fund’s policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of 
portfolio holdings information will prevent the misuse of such information by 
individuals or firms in possession of such information. 
In addition to the foregoing, the 
portfolio holdings of certain of the Adviser’s separately managed account 
investment strategies and other vehicles advised or sub-advised by the Adviser 
or its affiliates, which are the same or substantially similar to certain of the 
J.P. Morgan Funds, are made available on a more timely basis than the time 
period specified in the applicable prospectus. It is possible that any such 
recipient of these holdings could trade ahead of or against a Fund based on the 
information received. 
Finally, the Funds release 
information concerning any and all portfolio holdings when required by law. Such 
releases may include providing information concerning holdings of a specific 
security to the issuer of such security. With regard to the Money Market Funds, 
not later than five business days after the end of each calendar month, each 
Fund will post detailed information regarding its portfolio holdings, as well as 
its dollar-weighted average maturity and dollar-weighted average life, as of the 
last day of that month on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website and provide a link to 
the SEC website where the most recent twelve months of publicly available 
information filed by the Fund may be obtained. In addition, not later than five 
business days after the end of each calendar month, each Money Market Fund will 
file a schedule of detailed information regarding its portfolio holdings as of 
the last day of that month with the SEC. These filings will be publicly 
available on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website at www.jpmorganfunds.com and the 
SEC’s website. Each business day, each money market will make available upon 
request an uncertified complete schedule of its portfolio holdings as of the 
prior business day. In addition, each money market fund may post portfolio 
holdings on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website or on other external websites. In 
addition, on each business day, all money market funds will post their level of 
weekly liquid assets, net flows and market-based NAV per shares as of the prior 
business day, with a rolling six month history, and the money market funds 
(other than tax free and municipal money market funds) will post their level of 
daily liquid assets, with a rolling six month history, as of the prior business 
day on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website at www.jpmorganfunds.com. In addition to 
information on portfolio holdings, no sooner than 10 days after month end, the 
Funds may post a portfolio characteristics summary to the J.P. Morgan Funds’ 
website at www.jpmorganfunds.com. In addition, other fund statistical 
information may be found on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website from time to time. 

PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES 
The Board of Trustees has delegated 
to the Advisers and their affiliated advisers, proxy voting authority with 
respect to the Funds’ portfolio securities. To ensure that the proxies of 
portfolio companies are voted in the best interests of the Funds, the Funds’ 
Board of Trustees has adopted the Adviser’s detailed proxy voting procedures 
(the “Procedures”) that incorporate guidelines (“Guidelines”) for voting proxies 
on specific types of issues. 
The Adviser and its affiliated 
advisers are part of a global asset management organization with the capability 
to invest in securities of issuers located around the globe. Because the 
regulatory framework and the business cultures and practices vary from region to 
region, the Guidelines are customized for each region to take into account such 
variations. Separate Guidelines cover the regions of (1) North America, 
(2) Europe, Middle East, Africa, Central America and South America, 
(3) Asia (ex-Japan) and 
(4) Japan, respectively. In addition, SCR&M has adopted its own 
Guidelines and Procedures, effective December 1, 2016 specific to the Fund(s) 
and accounts it manages. 
Notwithstanding the variations among 
the Guidelines, all of the Guidelines have been designed with the uniform 
objective of encouraging corporate action that enhances shareholder value. As a 
general rule, in voting proxies of a particular security, the Adviser and its 
affiliated advisers will apply the Guidelines of the region in which the issuer 
of such security is organized. Except as noted below, proxy voting decisions 
will be made in accordance with the Guidelines covering a multitude of both 
routine and non-routine matters that 
the Adviser and its affiliated advisers have encountered globally, based on many 
years of collective investment management experience. 
 
Part II - 118 


To oversee and monitor the 
proxy-voting process, the Adviser has established a proxy committee and 
appointed a proxy administrator in each global location where proxies are voted. 
Effective December 1, 2016, SCR&M has established a separate proxy committee 
and appointed a separate proxy administrator. The primary function of each proxy 
committee is to review periodically general proxy-voting matters, review and 
approve the Guidelines annually, and provide advice and recommendations on 
general proxy-voting matters as well as on specific voting issues. The 
procedures permit an independent voting service to perform certain services 
otherwise carried out or coordinated by the proxy administrator. 
Although for many matters the 
Guidelines specify the votes to be cast, for many others, the Guidelines 
contemplate case-by-case determinations. In 
addition, there will undoubtedly be proxy matters that are not contemplated by 
the Guidelines. For both of these categories of matters and to override the 
Guidelines, the Procedures require a certification and review process to be 
completed before the vote is cast. That process is designed to identify actual 
or potential material conflicts of interest (between the Fund on the one hand, 
and the Fund’s investment adviser, principal underwriter or an affiliate of any 
of the foregoing, on the other hand) and ensure that the proxy vote is cast in 
the best interests of the Fund. A conflict is deemed to exist when the proxy is 
for JPMorgan Chase & Co. stock or for J.P. Morgan Funds, or when the proxy 
administrator has actual knowledge indicating that a JPMorgan affiliate is an 
investment banker or rendered a fairness opinion with respect to the matter that 
is the subject of the proxy vote. When such conflicts are identified, the proxy 
will be voted by an independent third party either in accordance with JPMorgan 
proxy voting guidelines or by the third party using its own guidelines. 

When other types of potential 
material conflicts of interest are identified, the applicable proxy 
administrator and, as necessary and applicable, a legal representative from the 
applicable proxy committee will evaluate the potential conflict of interest and 
determine whether such conflict actually exists, and if so, will recommend how 
the Adviser will vote the proxy. In addressing any material conflict, the 
Adviser may take one or more of the following measures (or other appropriate 
action): removing or “walling off” from the proxy voting process certain Adviser 
personnel with knowledge of the conflict, voting in accordance with any 
applicable Guideline if the application of the Guideline would objectively 
result in the casting of a proxy vote in a predetermined manner, or deferring 
the vote to or obtaining a recommendation from an third independent party, in 
which case the proxy will be voted by, or in accordance with the recommendation 
of, the independent third party. 
The following summarizes some of the 
more noteworthy types of proxy voting policies of the non-U.S. Guidelines: 
 



 
•
 

Corporate 
      governance procedures differ among the countries. Because of time 
      constraints and local customs, it is not always possible for the Adviser 
      to receive and review all proxy materials in connection with each item 
      submitted for a vote. Many proxy statements are in foreign languages. 
      Proxy materials are generally mailed by the issuer to the sub-custodian which holds the 
      securities for the client in the country where the portfolio company is 
      organized, and there may not be sufficient time for such materials to be 
      transmitted to the Adviser in time for a vote to be cast. In some 
      countries, proxy statements are not mailed at all, and in some locations, 
      the deadline for voting is two to four days after the initial announcement 
      that a vote is to be solicited and it may not always be possible to obtain 
      sufficient information to make an informed decision in good time to vote. 
      
 



 
•
 

Certain 
      markets require that shares being tendered for voting purposes are 
      temporarily immobilized from trading until after the shareholder meeting 
      has taken place. Elsewhere, notably emerging markets, it may not always be 
      possible to obtain sufficient information to make an informed decision in 
      good time to vote. Some markets require a local representative to be hired 
      in order to attend the meeting and vote in person on our behalf, which can 
      result in considerable cost. The Adviser also considers 
      the cost of voting in light of the expected benefit of the vote. In 
      certain instances, it may sometimes be in the Fund’s best interests to 
      intentionally refrain from voting in certain overseas markets from time to 
      time. 
 



 
•
 

Where 
      proxy issues concern corporate governance, takeover defense measures, 
      compensation plans, capital structure changes and so forth, the Adviser 
      pays particular attention to management’s arguments for promoting the 
      prospective change. The Adviser’s sole criterion in determining its voting 
      stance is whether such changes will be to the economic benefit of the 
      beneficial owners of the shares. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser is in favor of a unitary board structure of the type found in the 
      United Kingdom as opposed to tiered board structures. Thus, the Adviser 
      will generally vote to encourage the gradual phasing out of tiered board 
      structures, in favor of unitary boards. However, since tiered boards are 
      still very prevalent in markets outside of the United Kingdom, local 
      market practice will always be taken into account. 
  
 
Part II - 119 





 
•
 

The 
      Adviser will use its voting powers to encourage appropriate levels of 
      board independence, taking into account local market practice. 
    
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser will usually vote against discharging the board from 
      responsibility in cases of pending litigation, or if there is evidence of 
      wrongdoing for which the board must be held accountable. 
  
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser will vote in favor of increases in capital which enhance a 
      company’s long-term prospects. The Adviser will also vote in favor of the 
      partial suspension of preemptive rights if they are for purely technical 
      reasons (e.g., rights offers which may not be legally offered to 
      shareholders in certain jurisdictions). However, the Adviser will vote 
      against increases in capital which would allow the company to adopt 
      “poison pill” takeover defense tactics, or where the increase in 
      authorized capital would dilute shareholder value in the long term. 
      
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser will vote in favor of proposals which will enhance a company’s 
      long-term prospects. The Adviser will vote against an increase in bank 
      borrowing powers which would result in the company reaching an 
      unacceptable level of financial leverage, where such borrowing is 
      expressly intended as part of a takeover defense, or where there is a 
      material reduction in shareholder value. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser will generally vote against anti-takeover devices. 
  
 



 
•
 

Where 
      social or environmental issues are the subject of a proxy vote, the 
      Adviser will consider the issue on a case-by-case basis, keeping in 
      mind at all times the best economic interests of its clients. 
    
The following summarizes some of the 
more noteworthy types of proxy voting policies of the U.S. Guidelines: 

 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser considers votes on director nominees on a case-by-case basis. Votes 
      generally will be withheld from directors who: (a) attend less than 
      75% of board and committee meetings without a valid excuse; 
      (b) implement or renew a dead-hand poison pill; (c) are 
      affiliated directors who serve on audit, compensation or nominating 
      committees or are affiliated directors and the full board serves on such 
      committees or the company does not have such committees; (d) ignore a 
      shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of either the shares 
      outstanding or the votes cast based on a review over a consecutive two 
      year time frame; (e) are insiders and affiliated outsiders on boards that 
      are not at least majority independent; or (f) are CEOs of 
      publically-traded companies who serve on more than three public boards or 
      serve on more than four public company boards. In addition, votes are 
      generally withheld for directors who serve on committees in certain cases. 
      For example, the Adviser generally withholds votes from audit committee 
      members in circumstances in which there is evidence that there exists 
      material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls. 
  
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser votes proposals to classify boards on a case-by-case basis, but normally 
      will vote in favor of such proposal if the issuer’s governing documents 
      contain each of eight enumerated safeguards (for example, a majority of 
      the board is composed of independent directors and the nominating 
      committee is composed solely of such directors). 

 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser also considers management poison pill proposals on a case-by-case basis, looking for 
      shareholder-friendly provisions before voting in favor. 
  
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser votes against proposals for a super-majority vote to approve a 
      merger. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser considers proposals to increase common and/or preferred shares and 
      to issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan on a case-by-case basis, taking into 
      account such factors as the extent of dilution and whether the transaction 
      will result in a change in control. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser considers vote proposals with respect to compensation plans on a 
      case-by-case basis. The analysis of compensation plans focuses primarily 
      on the transfer of shareholder wealth (the dollar cost of pay plans to 
      shareholders) and includes an analysis of the structure of the plan and 
      pay practices of other companies in the relevant industry and peer 
      companies. Other matters included in the analysis are the amount of the 
      company’s outstanding stock to be reserved for the award of stock options, 
      whether the exercise price of an option is less than the stock’s fair 
      market value at the date of the grant of the options, and whether the plan 
      provides for the exchange of outstanding options for new ones at lower 
      exercise prices. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser also considers on a case-by-case basis proposals to 
      change an issuer’s state of incorporation, mergers and acquisitions and 
      other corporate restructuring proposals and certain social issue 
      proposals. 
 
Part II - 120 





 
•
 

The 
      Adviser generally votes for management proposals which seek shareholder 
      approval to make the state of incorporation the exclusive forum for 
      disputes if the company is a Delaware corporation; otherwise, the Adviser 
      votes on a case by case basis. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser generally supports management disclosure practices for 
      environmental issues except for those companies that have been involved in 
      significant controversies, fines or litigation related to environmental 
      issues. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      Adviser reviews Say on Pay proposals on a case by case basis with 
      additional review of proposals where the issuer’s previous year’s proposal 
      received a low level of support. 
In accordance with regulations of 
the SEC, the Funds’ proxy voting records for the most recent 12-month period ended June 30 are on 
file with the SEC and are available on the J.P. Morgan Funds’ website at 
www.jpmorganfunds.com and are on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
A Trust is not required to hold a 
meeting of Shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees except that 
(i) a Trust is required to hold a Shareholders’ meeting for the election of 
Trustees at such time as less than a majority of the Trustees holding office 
have been elected by Shareholders and (ii) if, as a result of a vacancy on 
the Board of Trustees, less than two-thirds of the Trustees holding office 
have been elected by the Shareholders, that vacancy may only be filled by a vote 
of the Shareholders. In addition, Trustees may be removed from office by a 
written consent signed by the holders of Shares representing two-thirds of the outstanding Shares of a 
Trust at a meeting duly called for the purpose, which meeting shall be called 
and held in accordance with the bylaws of the applicable Trust. Except as set 
forth above, the Trustees may continue to hold office and may appoint successor 
Trustees. 
As used in a Trust’s Prospectuses 
and in this SAI, “assets belonging to a Fund” means the consideration received 
by a Trust upon the issuance or sale of Shares in that Fund, together with all 
income, earnings, profits, and proceeds derived from the investment thereof, 
including any proceeds from the sale, exchange, or liquidation of such 
investments, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such 
proceeds, and any general assets of a Trust not readily identified as belonging 
to a particular Fund that are allocated to that Fund by a Trust’s Board of 
Trustees. The Board of Trustees may allocate such general assets in any manner 
it deems fair and equitable. It is anticipated that the factor that will be used 
by the Board of Trustees in making allocations of general assets to particular 
Funds will be the relative net asset values of the respective Funds at the time 
of allocation. Assets belonging to a particular Fund are charged with the direct 
liabilities and expenses in respect of that Fund, and with a share of the 
general liabilities and expenses of a Trust not readily identified as belonging 
to a particular Fund that are allocated to that Fund in proportion to the 
relative net asset values of the respective Funds at the time of allocation. The 
timing of allocations of general assets and general liabilities and expenses of 
a Trust to particular Funds will be determined by the Board of Trustees of a 
Trust and will be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Determinations by the Board of Trustees of a Trust as to the timing of the 
allocation of general liabilities and expenses and as to the timing and 
allocable portion of any general assets with respect to a particular Fund are 
conclusive. 
As used in this SAI and the 
Prospectuses, the term “majority of the outstanding voting securities” of the 
Trust, a particular Fund or a particular class of a Fund means the following 
when the 1940 Act governs the required approval: the affirmative vote of the 
lesser of (a) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Trust, such 
Fund or such class of such Fund, or (b) 67% or more of the shares of the 
Trust, such Fund or such class of such Fund present at a meeting at which the 
holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Trust, such Fund or 
such class of such Fund are represented in person or by proxy. Otherwise, the 
declaration of trust, articles of incorporation or by-laws usually govern the needed approval 
and generally require that if a quorum is present at a meeting, the vote of a 
majority of the shares of the Trust, such Fund or such class of such Fund, as 
applicable, shall decide the question. 
Telephone calls to the Funds, the 
Funds’ service providers or a Financial Intermediary as Financial Intermediary 
may be recorded. With respect to the securities offered hereby, this SAI and the 
Prospectuses do not contain all the information included in the Registration 
Statements of the Trusts filed with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act. 
Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, certain portions have been 
omitted. The Registration Statement including the exhibits filed therewith may 
be examined at the office of the SEC in Washington, D.C.

it is unlawful for the Funds or JPMDS to make such offer in such jurisdictions. 

 
Part II - 122 


APPENDIX A — PURCHASES, REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES 

The Funds have established certain 
procedures and restrictions, subject to change from time to time, for purchase, 
redemption, and exchange orders, including procedures for accepting telephone 
instructions and effecting automatic investments and redemptions. The Funds may 
defer acting on a shareholder’s instructions until it has received them in 
proper form and in accordance with the requirements described in the 
Prospectuses. 
Subject to the terms of a Fund’s 
prospectus, an investor may buy (or redeem) shares in certain Funds: 
(i) through a Financial Intermediary; or (ii) through JPMDS by calling 
J.P. Morgan Funds Services. Financial Intermediaries may include financial 
advisors, investment advisers, brokers, financial planners, banks, insurance 
companies, retirement or 401(k) plan administrators and others, including 
affiliates of JPMorgan Chase that have entered into an agreement with the 
Distributor, or, if applicable, an authorized designee of a Financial 
Intermediary. Upon receipt of any instructions or inquiries by telephone from a 
shareholder or, if held in a joint account, from either party, or from any 
person claiming to be the shareholder, and confirmation that the account 
registration and address given by such person match those on record, a Fund or 
its agent is authorized, without notifying the shareholder or joint account 
parties, to carry out the instructions or to respond to the inquiries, 
consistent with the service options chosen by the shareholder or joint 
shareholders in his or their latest account application or other written request 
for services, including purchasing, exchanging, or redeeming shares of such Fund 
and depositing and withdrawing monies from the bank account specified in the 
“Bank Account Registration” section of the shareholder’s latest account 
application or as otherwise properly specified to such Fund in writing. 
Investors may incur a fee if they effect transactions through a Financial 
Intermediary. 
The Funds may, at their own option, 
accept securities in payment for shares. The securities delivered in such a 
transaction are valued in the same manner as they would be valued for purposes 
of computing a Fund’s NAV, as described in the section entitled “Net Asset 
Value”. This is a taxable transaction to the shareholder. Purchases by means of 
in-kind contributions of securities 
will only be accepted if a variety of conditions are satisfied, in accordance 
with policies and procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. 
Except as provided in a Fund’s 
prospectus, and subject to compliance with applicable regulations, each Fund has 
reserved the right to pay the redemption price of its shares, either totally or 
partially, by a distribution in-kind of 
readily marketable portfolio securities (instead of cash). The securities so 
distributed would be valued at the same amount as that assigned to them in 
calculating the NAV of the shares being sold. If a shareholder received a 
distribution in-kind, the shareholder 
could incur brokerage or other charges in converting the securities to cash. 
JPMFMFG has filed an election under 18f-1 under the 1940 Act. The other Trusts 
have not filed an election under Rule 18f-1. However, the following Funds have 
previously filed Rule 18f-1 elections: 
(i) JPMorgan California Tax Free Bond Fund (formerly, J.P. Morgan 
California Bond Fund), (ii) JPMorgan Tax Aware Equity Fund, 
(iii) JPMorgan Intermediate Tax Free Bond Fund and JPMorgan New York Tax 
Free Bond Fund (as former series of Mutual Fund Select Trust), and 
(iv) JPMorgan International Equity Fund (as former series of Mutual Fund 
Select Group). These elections carry over and commit these Funds to paying 
redemptions by a shareholder of record in cash, limited during any 90 day period 
to the lesser of: (i) $250,000 or (ii) one percent of the net asset 
value of the Fund at the beginning of such period. 
The Money Market Funds reserve the 
right to waive any investment minimum. With respect to Agency, Capital, 
Institutional Class and Premier Shares, examples of when, in the Money Market 
Funds’ discretion, exceptions to the minimum requirements may be made include, 
but are not limited to, the following: (1) accounts of a parent corporation 
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries may be aggregated together to meet the minimum 
requirement; (2) accounts held by an institutional investor in any of the 
Money Market Funds in JPMT I or JPMT II may be aggregated together to meet the 
minimum requirement; and (3) an institutional investor may be given a 
reasonable amount of time to reach the investment minimum for a class. For 
Agency, Institutional Class and Premier Shares, investors must purchase the 
Shares directly from the J.P. Morgan Funds through JPMDS to potentially be 
eligible. In each case, the investors must inform the J.P. Morgan Funds (or 
their Financial Intermediary in the case of Capital Shares) that they have 
accounts that they may be eligible for an exception to the investment minimum. 

 
A-1 


Exchange Privilege. 
Shareholders may exchange their shares in a Fund for shares of any other 
J.P. Morgan Fund as indicated in the Prospectuses that offers such share class. 
The shareholder will not pay a sales charge for such exchange. The Funds reserve 
the right to limit the number of exchanges or to refuse an exchange. The Funds 
may discontinue this exchange privilege at any time. 
Shares of a Fund may only be 
exchanged into another Fund if the account registrations are identical. All 
exchanges are subject to meeting any investment minimum or eligibility 
requirements. With respect to exchanges from any Money Market Fund, shareholders 
must have acquired their shares in such money market fund by exchange from one 
of the J.P. Morgan non-money market 
funds or the exchange will be done at relative NAV plus the appropriate sales 
charge. Any such exchange may create a gain or loss to be recognized for federal 
income tax purposes. All exchanges are based upon the NAV that is next 
calculated after the Fund receives your order, provided the exchange out of one 
Fund must occur before the exchange into the other Fund. The redemption of your 
shares will be processed at the next calculated net asset value by the Fund 
whose shares you are redeeming, and your purchase will be processed as of the 
same time if the Fund into which you wish to exchange also calculates a net 
asset value at such time or if not, as of such Fund’s next calculated net asset 
value. The exchange might not be completed on the date on which the order is 
submitted and, in such case, the proceeds of the redemption may remain 
uninvested until the exchange is completed. A shareholder that exchanges out of 
shares of a Fund that accrues a daily dividend, including a money market fund, 
will accrue a dividend on the day of the redemption. A shareholder that 
exchanges into shares of a Fund that accrues dividends daily will not accrue a 
dividend on the day of the purchase. Normally, shares of the Fund to be acquired 
are purchased on the redemption date, but such purchase may be delayed by either 
Fund for up to five business days if a Fund determines that it would be 
disadvantaged by an immediate transfer of the proceeds. 
With regard to a Money Market Fund, 
when a fee or a gate is in place, shareholders will not be permitted to exchange 
into or out of a Money Market Fund. 
Redemptions. In general, 
shares of a Fund may be exchanged or redeemed at net asset value, less any 
applicable CDSC. The Trust may suspend the right of redemption or postpone the 
date of payment for Shares for more than seven days (more than one day for the 
Prime Money Market Fund, U.S. Treasury Plus Money Market Fund, and U.S. 
Government Money Market Fund when: 
 



 
(a)
trading on the Exchange is broadly restricted by the applicable 
      rules and regulations of the SEC; 
 



 
(b)
the Exchange is closed for other than customary weekend and holiday 
      closing; 
 



 
(c)
the SEC has by order permitted such suspension; or 
  
 



 
(d)
the SEC has declared a market emergency. 

With regard to Money Market Funds 
that do not qualify as Government Money Market Funds, if a Fund’s weekly liquid 
assets fall below 30% of its total assets, the Fund’s board, in its discretion, 
may impose liquidity fees of up to 2% of the value of the shares redeemed and/or 
gates on redemptions. In addition, if a Money Market Fund’s weekly liquid assets 
fall below 10% of its total assets at the end of any business day, the Fund must 
impose a 1% liquidity fee on shareholder redemptions unless the Fund’s Board of 
Trustees determines that not doing so is in the best interests of the Fund. 

The Board may, in its discretion, 
terminate a liquidity fee or redemption gate at any time if it believes such 
action to be in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. Also, 
liquidity fees and redemption gates will automatically terminate at the 
beginning of the next business day once a Fund’s weekly liquid assets reach at 
least 30% of its total assets. Redemption gates may only last up to 10 business 
days in any 90-day period. When a fee or a gate is in place, the Fund may elect 
not to permit the purchase of shares or to subject the purchase of shares to 
certain conditions, which may include affirmation of the purchaser’s knowledge 
that a fee or a gate is in effect. When a fee or a gate is in place, 
shareholders will not be permitted to exchange into or out of a Money Market 
Fund. 
With regard to the Money Market 
Funds, the Board may, in its discretion, permanently suspend redemptions and 
liquidate if, among other things, a Fund, at the end of a business day, has less 
than 10% of its total assets invested in weekly liquid assets. The Board of the 
Retail and Government Money Market Funds may suspend redemptions and liquidate 
if the Board determines that the deviation between its amortized cost price per 
share and its market-based NAV per share may result in material dilution or 
other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders. 
 
A-2 


Excessive Trading Limits. 
Market timers may disrupt portfolio management and harm Fund performance. To the 
extent that a Fund is unable to effectively identify market timers or a Fund 
does not seek to identify market timers, long-term investors may be adversely 
affected. The Funds do not authorize market timing and, except for the Funds 
identified in the Prospectuses, use reasonable efforts to identify market 
timers. There is no assurance, however, that the Funds will be able to identify 
and eliminate all market timers. For example, certain accounts include multiple 
investors and such accounts typically provide the Funds with a net purchase or 
redemption request on any given day where purchasers of Fund shares and 
redeemers of Fund shares are netted against one another and the identity of 
individual purchasers and redeemers whose orders are aggregated are not known by 
the Funds. For purposes of the application of the excessive trading limitations, 
J.P. Morgan Funds that invest in other J.P. Morgan Funds will be considered 
asset allocation programs within the stated exceptions to the excessive trading 
limits in the Prospectuses. 
Additional Information About 
Class C Shares. The Distributor pays a commission of 1.00% of the offering 
price on sales of Class C Shares. The Distributor keeps the entire amount of any 
CDSC the investor pays for Class C Shares. 
If an investor redeems Class C 
Shares and then uses that money to buy Class C Shares of a J.P. Morgan Fund 
within 90 days of that redemption, the second purchase will be free of a CDSC. 
Also, the 12b-1 aging will include the 
investor’s prior months’ holdings, so that the Financial Intermediary will 
receive the trail sooner. 
On June 19, 2015, the Funds’ Class B 
Shares were converted into Class A Shares (into Morgan Shares for the Money 
Market Funds) of the same Fund, notwithstanding the prior conversion schedule 
that indicated a later date. No contingent deferred sales charges were assessed 
in connection with this automatic conversion. 
Systematic Withdrawal Plan. 
Systematic withdrawals may be made on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
The applicable Class C CDSC will be deducted from those payments unless such 
payments are made: 
(i) monthly and constitute no more 
than 1/12 of 10% of your then-current balance in a Fund each month; or 

(ii) quarterly and constitute no 
more than 1/4 of 10% of your then-current balance in a Fund each quarter. 

If you withdraw more than the limits 
stated above in any given systematic withdrawal payment, you will be charged a 
CDSC for the amount of the withdrawal over the limit for that month or quarter. 

For accounts that allow systematic 
withdrawals only as a fixed dollar amount per month or quarter, the applicable 
Class C CDSC is waived provided that, on the date of the systematic withdrawal, 
the fixed dollar amount to be withdrawn, when multiplied by 12 in the case of 
monthly payments or by four in the case of quarterly payments, does not exceed 
10% of your then-current balance in the Fund. If on any given systematic 
withdrawal date that amount would exceed 10%, you will be charged a CDSC on the 
entire amount of that systematic withdrawal payment. This calculation is 
repeated on each systematic withdrawal date. 
For accounts that allow systematic 
withdrawals on a percentage basis, a Class C CDSC will be charged only on that 
amount of a systematic payment that exceeds the limits set forth above for that 
month or quarter. 
Your current balance in a Fund for 
purposes of these calculations will be determined by multiplying the number of 
shares held by the then-current net asset value for shares of the applicable 
class. 
Cut-Off Times for Purchase, Redemption and 
Exchange Orders. Orders to purchase, exchange or redeem shares accepted by 
the Funds (or by a Financial Intermediary authorized to accept such orders on 
behalf of the Funds) by the cut-off times indicated in the Funds’ Prospectuses 
will be processed at the NAV next calculated after the order is accepted by the 
Fund or the Financial Intermediary. Under a variety of different types of 
servicing agreements, if a Financial Intermediary that is authorized to accept 
purchase, exchange and/or redemption orders from investors on behalf of the 
Funds accepts orders prior to the cut-off time for orders stated in the Funds’ 
Prospectuses, the Financial Intermediary may transmit the orders to the Funds by 
the deadlines stated in the servicing agreements. The deadlines in the servicing 
agreements are generally later than the order cut-off times stated in the Funds’ 
Prospectuses.

Additional Information 

A Fund may require medallion 
signature guarantees for changes that shareholders request be made in Fund 
records with respect to their accounts, including but not limited to, changes in 
bank accounts, for any written requests for additional account services made 
after a shareholder has submitted an initial account application to a Fund, and 
in certain other circumstances described in the Prospectuses. A Fund may also 
refuse to accept or carry out any transaction that does not satisfy any 
restrictions then in effect. A medallion signature guarantee may be obtained 
from an approved bank, broker, savings and loan association or credit union 
under Rule 17Ad-15 of the Securities 
Exchange Act. 
The Funds reserve the right to 
change any of these policies at any time and may reject any request to purchase 
shares at a reduced sales charge. 
Investors may incur a fee if they 
effect transactions through a Financial Intermediary.

APPENDIX B — DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS 
The following is a summary of 
published ratings by major credit rating agencies. Credit ratings evaluate only 
the safety of principal and interest payments, not the market value risk of 
lower quality securities. Credit rating agencies may fail to change credit 
ratings to reflect subsequent events on a timely basis. Although the investment 
adviser considers security ratings when making investment decisions, it also 
performs its own investment analysis and does not rely solely on the ratings 
assigned by credit agencies. 
Unrated securities will be treated 
as non-investment grade securities 
unless the investment adviser determines that such securities are the equivalent 
of investment grade securities. Securities that have received different ratings 
from more than one agency are considered investment grade if at least one agency 
has rated the security investment grade, unless otherwise indicated in a Fund’s 
prospectus or SAI. 
Certain Funds are rated by NRSROs. 
In order to maintain a rating from a rating organization, the Funds may be 
subject to additional investment restrictions. 
DESCRIPTION OF SHORT-TERM CREDIT 
RATINGS 
Standard & Poor’s 
Corporation (“S&P”) 
A S&P’s issue credit rating is a 
forward-looking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to 
a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a 
specific financial program (including ratings on medium-term note programs and 
commercial paper programs). It takes into consideration the creditworthiness of 
guarantors, insurers, or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and 
takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated. The 
opinion reflects S&P’s view of the obligor’s capacity and willingness to 
meet its financial commitments as they come due, and may assess terms, such as 
collateral security and subordination, which could affect ultimate payment in 
the event of default. 
Issuer credit ratings can be either 
long term or short term. Short-term ratings are generally assigned to those 
obligations considered short-term in the relevant market. In the U.S., for 
example, that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than 365 
days–including commercial paper. Short-term ratings are also used to indicate 
the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on long-term 
obligations. The result is a dual rating, in which the short-term rating 
addresses the put feature, in addition to the usual long-term rating. 
Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings. 
 




A-1 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘A-1’ is rated 
      in the highest category by Standard & Poor’s. The obligor’s capacity 
      to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this 
      category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This 
      indicates that the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on 
      these obligations is extremely strong. 



 




 

 




A-2 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘A-2’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects 
      of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in 
      higher rating categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its 
      financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory. 
  
 




A-3 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘A-3’ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, 
      adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to 
      lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial 
      commitment on the obligation. 
 




B 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘B’ is regarded as having significant speculative 
      characteristics. Ratings of ‘B-1’, ‘B-2’, and ‘B-3’ may be assigned to 
      indicate finer distinctions within the ‘B’ category. The obligor currently 
      has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation; 
      however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the 
      obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
      obligation. 
 




B-1 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘B-1’ is regarded as having significant speculative 
      characteristics, but the obligor has a relatively stronger capacity to 
      meet its financial commitments over the short-term compared to other 
      speculative-grade obligors. 
 




B-2 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘B-2’ is regarded as having significant speculative 
      characteristics, and the obligor has an average speculative-grade capacity 
      to meet its financial commitments over the short-term compared to other 
      speculative-grade obligors. 



 

 
B-1 






B-3 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘B-3’ is regarded as having significant speculative 
      characteristics, and the obligor has a relatively weaker capacity to meet 
      its financial commitments over the short-term compared to other 
      speculative-grade obligors. 
 




C 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘C’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is 
      dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for 
      the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
  
 




D 
A short-term 
      obligation rated ‘D’ is in payment default. The ‘D’ rating category is 
      used when payments on an obligation, including a regulatory capital 
      instrument, are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace 
      period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor’s believes that such 
      payments will be made during such grace period. The ‘D’ rating also will 
      be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a 
      similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized. 
  
Dual Ratings 
S&P assigns “dual” ratings to 
all debt issues that have a put option or demand feature as part of their 
structure. The first rating addresses the likelihood of repayment of principal 
and interest as due, and the second rating addresses only the demand feature. 
The long-term rating symbols are used for bonds to denote the long-term maturity 
and the short-term rating symbols for the put option (for example, ‘AAA/A-1+’). 
With U.S. municipal short-term demand debt, note rating symbols are used with 
the short-term issue credit rating symbols (for example, ‘SP-1+/A-1+’). 

Active Qualifiers (Currently 
applied and/or outstanding) 
i: This subscript is used for issues 
in which the credit factors, terms, or both, that determine the likelihood of 
receipt of payment of interest are different from the credit factors, terms or 
both that determine the likelihood of receipt of principal on the obligation. 
The ‘i’ subscript indicates that the rating addresses the interest portion of 
the obligation only. The ‘i’ subscript will always be used in conjunction with 
the ‘p’ subscript, which addresses likelihood of receipt of principal. For 
example, a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of “AAAp NRi” indicating 
that the principal portion is rated “AAA” and the interest portion of the 
obligation is not rated. 
L: Ratings qualified with ‘L’ apply 
only to amounts invested up to federal deposit insurance limits. 
P: This subscript is used for issues 
in which the credit factors, the terms, or both, that determine the likelihood 
of receipt of payment of principal are different from the credit factors, terms 
or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of interest on the obligation. 
The ‘p’ subscript indicates that the rating addresses the principal portion of 
the obligation only. The ‘p’ subscript will always be used in conjunction with 
the ‘i’ subscript, which addresses likelihood of receipt of interest. For 
example, a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of “AAAp NRi” indicating 
that the principal portion is rated “AAA” and the interest portion of the 
obligation is not rated. 
pi: Ratings with a ‘pi’ subscript 
are based on an analysis of an issuer’s published financial information, as well 
as additional information in the public domain. They do not, however, reflect 
in-depth meetings with an issuer’s management and are therefore based on less 
comprehensive information than ratings without a ‘pi’ subscript. Ratings with a 
‘pi’ subscript are reviewed annually based on a new year’s financial statements, 
but may be reviewed on an interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect 
the issuer’s credit quality. 
Preliminary: Preliminary ratings, 
with the “prelim” qualifier, may be assigned to obligors or obligations, 
including financial programs, in the circumstances described below. Assignment 
of a final rating is conditional on the receipt by S&P’s of appropriate 
documentation. S&P’s reserves the right not to issue a final rating. 
Moreover, if a final rating is issued, it may differ from the preliminary 
rating. 
 



 
•
 

Preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations, most commonly 
      structured and project finance issues, pending receipt of final 
      documentation and legal opinions. 
 



 
•
 

Preliminary ratings are assigned to Rule 415 Shelf Registrations. 
      As specific issues, with defined terms, are offered from the master 
      registration, a final rating may be assigned to them in accordance with 
      S&P’s policies. 
 



 
•
 

Preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations that will likely 
      be issued upon the obligor’s emergence from bankruptcy or similar 
      reorganization, based on late-stage reorganization plans, documentation 
      and 
 
B-2 





 

discussions with the 
      obligor. Preliminary ratings may also be assigned to the obligors. These 
      ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality of the reorganized 
      or postbankruptcy issuer as well as attributes of the anticipated 
      obligation(s). 
 



 
•
 

Preliminary ratings may be assigned to entities that are being 
      formed or that are in the process of being independently established when, 
      in S&P’s opinion, documentation is close to final. Preliminary ratings 
      may also be assigned to these entities’ obligations. 
  
 



 
•
 

Preliminary ratings may be assigned when a previously unrated 
      entity is undergoing a well-formulated restructuring, recapitalization, 
      significant financing or other transformative event, generally at the 
      point that investor or lender commitments are invited. The preliminary 
      rating may be assigned to the entity and to its proposed obligation(s). 
      These preliminary ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality 
      of the obligor, as well as attributes of the anticipated obligation(s), 
      assuming successful completion of the transformative event. Should the 
      transformative event not occur, S&P’s would likely withdraw these 
      preliminary ratings. 
 



 
•
 

A 
      preliminary recovery rating may be assigned to an obligation that has a 
      preliminary issue credit rating. 
sf: The (sf) subscript is assigned 
to all issues and issuers to which a regulation, such as the European Union 
Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies, requires the assignment of an additional 
symbol which distinguishes a structured finance instrument or obligor (as 
defined in the regulation) from any other instrument or obligor. The addition of 
this subscript to a credit rating does not change the definition of that rating 
or our opinion about the issue’s or issuer’s creditworthiness. 
t: This symbol indicates termination 
structures that are designed to honor their contracts to full maturity or, 
should certain events occur, to terminate and cash settle all their contracts 
before their final maturity date. 
Unsolicited: Unsolicited ratings are 
those credit ratings assigned at the initiative of S&P’s and not at the 
request of the issuer or its agents. 
Inactive Qualifiers (No longer 
applied or outstanding) 
*: This symbol indicated continuance 
of the ratings is contingent upon S&P’s receipt of an executed copy of the 
escrow agreement or closing documentation confirming investments and cash flows. 
Discontinued use in August 1998. 
c: This qualifier was used to 
provide additional information to investors that the bank may terminate its 
obligation to purchase tendered bonds if the long-term credit rating of the 
issuer is below an investment-grade level and/or the issuer’s bonds are deemed 
taxable. Discontinued use in January 2001. 
pr: The letters ‘pr’ indicate that 
the rating is provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful 
completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that 
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the 
successful, timely completion of the project. This rating, however, while 
addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project, makes no 
comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such 
completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such 
likelihood and risk. 
q: A ‘q’ subscript indicates that 
the rating is based solely on quantitative analysis of publicly available 
information. Discontinued use in April 2001. 
r: The ‘r’ modifier was assigned to 
securities containing extraordinary risks, particularly market risks, that are 
not covered in the credit rating. The absence of an ‘r’ modifier should not be 
taken as an indication that an obligation will not exhibit extraordinary 
non-credit related risks. S&P discontinued the use of the ‘r’ modifier for 
most obligations in June 2000 and for the balance of obligations (mainly 
structured finance transactions) in November 2002. 
Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) 

A short-term issuer or obligation 
rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the 
rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial 
obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant 
obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial 
maturity is viewed as “short term” based on market convention. Typically, this 
means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and 
up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets. 
 
B-3 






F1 
HIGHEST SHORT-TERM 
      CREDIT QUALITY. Indicates the strongest capacity for timely payment of 
      financial commitments; may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally 
      strong credit feature. 
 




F2 
GOOD SHORT-TERM 
      CREDIT QUALITY. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial 
      obligations. 
 




F3 
FAIR SHORT-TERM 
      CREDIT QUALITY. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial 
      commitments is adequate. 
 




B 
SPECULATIVE 
      SHORT-TERM CREDIT QUALITY. Minimal capacity for timely payment of 
      financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse 
      changes in financial and economic conditions. 



 

 




C 
HIGH SHORT-TERM 
      DEFAULT RISK. Default is a real possibility. 
 




RD 
RESTRICTED DEFAULT. 
      Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial 
      commitments, although it continues to meet other obligations. Applicable 
      to entity ratings only. 
 




D 
Indicates a 
      broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a specific 
      short-term obligation. 
Limitations of the Short-Term 
Ratings Scale 
Specific limitations relevant to the 
Short-Term Ratings scale include: 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood over 
      any given time period. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer’s securities or 
      stock, or the likelihood that this value may change. 
  
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer’s securities or stock. 
      
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an obligation should 
      an obligation default. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer or transaction’s 
      profile other that the agency’s opinion on the relative vulnerability to 
      default of the rated issuer or obligation. 
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. 
(“Moody’s”) 
Moody’s short-term ratings are 
opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations. 
Ratings may be assigned to issuers, short-term programs or to individual 
short-term debt instruments. Such obligations generally have an original 
maturity not exceeding thirteen months, unless explicitly noted. 
Moody’s employs the following 
designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers: 

 




P-1 
Issuers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to 
      repay short-term debt obligations. 
 




P-2 
Issuers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay 
      short-term debt obligations. 
 




P-3 
Issuers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay 
      short-term obligations. 
 




NP 
Issuers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the 
      Prime rating categories. 
 




Note: 
Canadian issuers 
      rated P-1 or P-2 have their short-term ratings enhanced by the senior-most 
      long term rating of the issuer, its guarantor or support-provider. 
    
Dominion Bond Rating Service 
(“DBRS”) 
The DBRS short-term debt rating 
scale provides an opinion on the risk that an issuer will not meet its 
short-term financial obligations in a timely manner. Ratings are based on 
quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer and the 
relative ranking of claims. The R-1 and R-2 rating categories are further 
denoted by the subcategories “(high)”, “(middle)”, and “(low)”. 
 
B-4 






R-1 (high) 
Highest credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations 
      as they fall due is exceptionally high. Unlikely to be adversely affected 
      by future events. 
 




R-1 (middle) 
Superior credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations 
      as they fall due is very high. Differs from R-1 (high) by a relatively 
      modest degree. Unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events. 
      
 




R-1 (low) 
Good credit quality. 
      The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations as they 
      fall due is substantial. Overall strength is not as favourable as higher 
      rating categories. May be vulnerable to future events, but qualifying 
      negative factors are considered manageable. 
 




R-2 (high) 
Upper end of 
      adequate credit quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term 
      financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable. May be vulnerable to 
      future events. 
 




R-2 (middle) 
Adequate credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations 
      as they fall due is acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events or may 
      be exposed to other factors that could reduce credit quality. 
  
 




R-2 (low) 
Lower end of 
      adequate credit quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term 
      financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable. May be vulnerable to 
      future events. A number of challenges are present that could affect the 
      issuer’s ability to meet such obligations. 
 




R-3 
Lowest end of 
      adequate credit quality. There is a capacity for the payment of short-term 
      financial obligations as they fall due. May be vulnerable to future events 
      and the certainty of meeting such obligations could be impacted by a 
      variety of developments. 
 




R-4 
Speculative credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of short-term financial obligations 
      as they fall due is uncertain. 
 




R-5 
Highly speculative 
      credit quality. There is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to 
      meet short-term financial obligations as they fall due. 
  
 




D 
A financial 
      obligation has not been met or it is clear that a financial obligation 
      will not be met in the near future, or a debt instrument has been subject 
      to a distressed exchange. A downgrade to D may not immediately follow an 
      insolvency or restructuring filing as grace periods, other procedural 
      considerations, or extenuating circumstance may exist. 
  
DESCRIPTION OF BANK RATINGS 

Moody’s 
Moody’s Bank Financial Strength 
Ratings (BFSRs) represent Moody’s opinion of a bank’s intrinsic safety and 
soundness and, as such, exclude certain external credit risks and credit support 
elements that are addressed by Moody’s Bank Deposit Ratings. In addition to 
commercial banks, Moody’s BFSRs may also be assigned to other types of financial 
institutions such as multilateral development banks, government-sponsored 
financial institutions and national development financial institutions. 

Unlike Moody’s Bank Deposit Ratings, 
BSFRs do not address the probability of timely payment. Instead, BSFRs are a 
measure of the likelihood that a bank will require assistance from third parties 
such as its owners, its industry group, or official institutions. 
BSFRs do not take into account the 
probability that the bank will receive such external support, nor do they 
address risks arising from sovereign actions that may interfere with a bank’s 
ability to honor its domestic or foreign currency obligations. 
Factors considered in the assignment 
of BSFRs include bank-specific elements such as financial fundamentals, 
franchise value, and business and asset diversification. Although BSFRs exclude 
the external factors specified above, they do take into account other risk 
factors in the bank’s operating environment, including the strength and 
prospective performance of the economy, as well as the structure and relative 
fragility of the financial system, and the quality of banking regulation and 
supervision. 
 




A 
Banks rated A 
      possess superior intrinsic financial strength. Typically, they will be 
      institutions with highly valuable and defensible business franchises, 
      strong financial fundamentals, and a very predictable and stable operating 
      environment. 
 




B 
Banks rated B 
      possess strong intrinsic financial strength. Typically, they will be 
      institutions with valuable and defensible business franchises, good 
      financial fundamentals, and a predictable and stable operating 
      environment. 
 
B-5 






C 
Banks rated C 
      possess adequate intrinsic financial strength. Typically, they will be 
      institutions with more limited but still valuable business franchises. 
      These banks will display either acceptable financial fundamentals within a 
      predictable and stable operating environment, or good financial 
      fundamentals within a less predictable and stable operating environment. 
      
 




D 
Banks rated D 
      display modest intrinsic financial strength, potentially requiring some 
      outside support at times. Such institutions may be limited by one or more 
      of the following factors: a weak business franchise; financial 
      fundamentals that are deficient in one or more respects; or an 
      unpredictable and unstable operating environment. 

 




E 
Banks rated E 
      display very modest intrinsic financial strength, with a higher likelihood 
      of periodic outside support or an eventual need for outside assistance. 
      Such institutions may be limited by one or more of the following factors: 
      a weak and limited business franchise; financial fundamentals that are 
      materially deficient in one or more respects; or a highly unpredictable or 
      unstable operating environment. 
Where appropriate, a “+” modifier 
will be appended to ratings below the “A” category and a “-” modifier will be appended to ratings 
above the “E” category to distinguish those banks that fall in the higher and 
lower ends, respectively, of the generic rating category. 
DESCRIPTION OF LONG-TERM CREDIT 
RATINGS 
S&P 
Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings 

Issue credit ratings are based, in 
varying degrees, on Standard & Poor’s analysis of the following 
considerations: 
 



 
•
 

Likelihood 
      of payment — capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial 
      commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the 
      obligation; 
 



 
•
 

Nature of 
      and provisions of the obligation; 
 



 
•
 

Protection 
      afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the event of 
      bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the laws of 
      bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors’ rights. 
  
Issue ratings are an assessment of 
default risk, but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or 
ultimate recovery in the event of default. Junior obligations are typically 
rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in 
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation may apply when an entity has 
both senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or 
operating company and holding company obligations.) 
 




AAA 
An obligation rated 
      ‘AAA’ has the highest rating assigned by S&P. The obligor’s capacity 
      to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong. 
      
 




AA 
An obligation rated 
      ‘AA’ differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. 
      The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
      is very strong. 
 




A 
An obligation rated 
      ‘A’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in 
      circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated 
      categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial 
      commitment on the obligation is still strong. 
 




BBB 
An obligation rated 
      ‘BBB’ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic 
      conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened 
      capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the 
      obligation. 
Obligations rated ‘BB’, ‘B’, ‘CCC’, 
‘CC’, and ‘C’ are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. 
‘BB’ indicates the least degree of speculation and ‘C’ the highest. While such 
obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these 
may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse 
conditions. 
 




BB 
An obligation rated 
      ‘BB’ is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. 
      However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse 
      business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the 
      obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
      obligation. 
 
B-6 






B 
An obligation rated 
      ‘B’ is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated ‘BB’, but the 
      obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
      obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will 
      likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial 
      commitment on the obligation. 
 




CCC 
An obligation rated 
      ‘CCC’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon 
      favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to 
      meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse 
      business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to 
      have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
      
 




CC 
An obligation rated 
      ‘CC’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. 

 




C 
A ‘C’ rating is 
      assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to 
      nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms 
      of the documents, or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a 
      bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment 
      default. Among others, the ‘C’ rating may be assigned to subordinated 
      debt, preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have 
      been suspended in accordance with the instrument’s terms or when preferred 
      stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all 
      of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by 
      other instruments having a total value that is less than par. 
  
 




D 
An obligation rated 
      ‘D’ is in payment default. The ‘D’ rating category is used when payments 
      on an obligation, including a regulatory capital instrument, are not made 
      on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, 
      unless Standard & Poor’s believes that such payments will be made 
      during such grace period. The ‘D’ rating also will be used upon the filing 
      of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action if payments on an 
      obligation are jeopardized. An obligation’s rating is lowered to ‘D’ upon 
      completion of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the 
      issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other 
      instruments having a total value that is less than par. 
  
Plus(+) or Minus (-): The ratings from AA to CCC may be 
modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the 
major rating categories. 
 




NR 
This indicates that 
      no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on 
      which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poor’s does not rate a 
      particular obligation as a matter of policy. 
Moody’s 
Long-Term Obligation Ratings 

Moody’s long-term ratings are 
opinions of the relative credit risk of financial obligations with an original 
maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a financial 
obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings use Moody’s Global 
Scale and reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered 
in the event of default. 
 




Aaa 
Obligations rated 
      Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal credit risk. 
      
 




Aa 
Obligations rated Aa 
      are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk. 
      
 




A 
Obligations rated A 
      are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. 
      
 




Baa 
Obligations rated 
      Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade 
      and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. 
  
 




Ba 
Obligations rated Ba 
      are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial 
      credit risk. 
 




B 
Obligations rated B 
      are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. 
  
 




Caa 
Obligations rated 
      Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit 
      risk. 
 




Ca 
Obligations rated Ca 
      are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some 
      prospect of recovery of principal and interest. 

 




C 
Obligations rated C 
      are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default, with 
      little prospect for recovery of principal or interest. 
  
 
B-7 


Moody’s applies numerical modifiers, 
1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classified from Aa through Caa. The modifier 
1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating 
category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 
indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. 

Fitch 
Rated entities in a number of 
sectors, including financial and non-financial corporations, sovereigns and 
insurance companies, are generally assigned Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs). IDRs 
opine on an entity’s relative vulnerability to default on financial obligations. 
The “threshold” default risk addressed by the IDR is generally that of the 
financial obligations whose non-payment would best reflect the uncured failure 
of that entity. As such, IDRs also address relative vulnerability to bankruptcy, 
administrative receivership or similar concepts, although the agency recognizes 
that issuers may also make pre-emptive and therefore voluntary use of such 
mechanisms. 
In aggregate, IDRs provide an 
ordinal ranking of issuers based on the agency’s view of their relative 
vulnerability to default, rather than a prediction of a specific percentage 
likelihood of default. 
 




AAA 
HIGHEST CREDIT 
      QUALITY. ‘AAA’ ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They 
      are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of 
      financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely 
      affected by foreseeable events. 
 




AA 
VERY HIGH CREDIT 
      QUALITY. ‘AA’ ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They 
      indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This 
      capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. 
  



 

 




A 
HIGH CREDIT QUALITY. 
      ‘A’ ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for 
      payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, 
      nevertheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in 
      economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings. 
  
 




BBB 
GOOD CREDIT QUALITY. 
      ‘BBB’ ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. 
      The capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered 
      adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions 
      are more likely to impair this capacity. 
 




BB 
SPECULATIVE. ‘BB’ 
      ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in 
      the event of adverse economic change over time; however, business or 
      financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to 
      be met. 
 




B 
HIGHLY SPECULATIVE. 
      ‘B’ ratings indicate that material default risk is present, but a limited 
      margin of safety remains. Financial commitments are currently being met; 
      however, capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to deterioration in 
      the business and economic environment. 
 




CCC 
SUBSTANTIAL CREDIT 
      RISK. Default is a real possibility. 
 




CC 
VERY HIGH LEVELS OF 
      CREDIT RISK. Default of some kind appears probable. 

 




C 
EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH 
      LEVELS OF CREDIT RISK. Default is imminent or inevitable, or the issuer is 
      in standstill. Conditions that are indicative of a ‘C’ category rating for 
      an issuer include: 
 



 
•
 

the issuer 
      has entered into a grace or cure period following non-payment of a 
      material financial obligation; 
 



 
•
 

the issuer 
      has entered into a temporary negotiated waiver or standstill agreement 
      following a payment default on a material financial obligation; or 
      
 



 
•
 

Fitch 
      otherwise believes a condition of ‘RD’ or ‘D’ to be imminent or 
      inevitable, including through the formal announcement of a coercive debt 
      exchange. 
 




RD 
RESTRICTED DEFAULT. 
      ‘RD’ ratings indicate an issuer that in Fitch’s opinion has experienced an 
      uncured payment default on a bond, loan or other material financial 
      obligation but which has not entered into bankruptcy filings, 
      administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up 
      procedure, and which has not otherwise ceased business. This would 
      include: 
 



 
•
 

the 
      selective payment default on a specific class or currency of debt; 
      
 
B-8 





 
•
 

the 
      uncured expiry of any applicable grace period, cure period or default 
      forbearance period following a payment default on a bank loan, capital 
      markets security or other material financial obligation; 
  
 



 
•
 

the 
      extension of multiple waivers or forbearance periods upon a payment 
      default on one or more material financial obligations, either in series or 
      in parallel; or 
 



 
•
 

execution 
      of a coercive debt exchange on one or more material financial obligations. 
      
 




D 
DEFAULT. ‘D’ ratings 
      indicate an issuer that in Fitch Ratings’ opinion has entered into 
      bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other 
      formal winding-up procedure, or which has otherwise ceased business. 
      
Default ratings are not assigned 
prospectively to entities or their obligations; within this context, non-payment 
on an instrument that contains a deferral feature or grace period will generally 
not be considered a default until after the expiration of the deferral or grace 
period, unless a default is otherwise driven by bankruptcy or other similar 
circumstance, or by a coercive debt exchange. 
“Imminent” default typically refers 
to the occasion where a payment default has been intimated by the issuer, and is 
all but inevitable. This may, for example, be where an issuer has missed a 
scheduled payment, but (as is typical) has a grace period during which it may 
cure the payment default. Another alternative would be where an issuer has 
formally announced a coercive debt exchange, but the date of the exchange still 
lies several days or weeks in the immediate future. 
In all cases, the assignment of a 
default rating reflects the agency’s opinion as to the most appropriate rating 
category consistent with the rest of its universe of ratings, and may differ 
from the definition of default under the terms of an issuer’s financial 
obligations or local commercial practice. 
Note: 
The modifiers “+” or “-” may be 
appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. 
Such suffixes are not added to the ‘AAA’ Long-Term IDR category, or to Long-Term 
IDR categories below ‘B’. 
Limitations of the Issuer Credit 
Rating Scale: 
Specific limitations relevant to the 
issuer credit rating scale include: 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood over 
      any given time period. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer’s securities or 
      stock, or the likelihood that this value may change. 
  
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer’s securities or stock. 
      
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an obligation should 
      an issuer default. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the suitability of an issuer as a counterparty to 
      trade credit. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer’s business, 
      operational or financial profile other than the agency’s opinion on its 
      relative vulnerability to default. 
DBRS 
Long-Term Obligations 

The DBRS long-term rating scale 
provides an opinion on the risk of default. That is, the risk that an issuer 
will fail to satisfy its financial obligations in accordance with the terms 
under which an obligations has been issued. Ratings are based on quantitative 
and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer, and the relative ranking 
of claims. All rating categories other than AAA and D also contain subcategories 
“(high)” and “(low)”. The absence of either a “(high)” or “(low)” designation 
indicates the rating is in the middle of the category. 
 




AAA 
Highest credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is 
      exceptionally high and unlikely to be adversely affected by future events. 
      
 




AA 
Superior credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is 
      considered high. Credit quality differs from AAA only to a small degree. 
      Unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events. 
  
 
B-9 






A 
Good credit quality. 
      The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is substantial, but 
      of lesser credit quality than AA. May be vulnerable to future events, but 
      qualifying negative factors are considered manageable. 
  
 




BBB 
Adequate credit 
      quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is 
      considered acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events. 
  
 




BB 
Speculative, non 
      investment-grade credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial 
      obligations is uncertain. Vulnerable to future events. 
  
 




B 
Highly speculative 
      credit quality. There is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to 
      meet financial obligations. 
 




CCC/CC/C 
Very highly 
      speculative credit quality. In danger of defaulting on financial 
      obligations. There is little difference between these three categories, 
      although CC and C ratings are normally applied to obligations that are 
      seen as highly likely to default, or subordinated to obligations rated in 
      the CCC to B range. Obligations in respect of which default has not 
      technically taken place but is considered inevitable may be rated in the C 
      category. 
 




D 
A financial 
      obligation has not been met or it is clear that a financial obligation 
      will not be met in the near future or a debt instrument has been subject 
      to a distressed exchange. A downgrade to D may not immediately follow an 
      insolvency or restructuring filing as grace periods or extenuating 
      circumstances may exist. 
DESCRIPTION OF INSURANCE RATINGS 

Moody’s 
Insurance Financial Strength 
Ratings 
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength 
Ratings are opinions of the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually 
senior policyholder claims and obligations. Specific obligations are considered 
unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular 
insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing 
under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. 

Insurance Financial Strength 
Ratings, shown in connection with property/casualty groups, represent the 
ratings of individual companies within those groups, as displayed in Moody’s 
insurance industry ratings list. The rating of an individual property/casualty 
company may be based on the benefit of its participation in an intercompany 
pooling agreement. Pooling agreements may or may not provide for continuation of 
in-force policyholder obligations by 
pool members in the event that the property/casualty insurer is sold to a third 
party or otherwise removed from the pooling agreement. 
Moody’s assumes in these ratings 
that the pooling agreement will not be modified by the members of the pool to 
reduce the benefits of pool participation, and that the insurer will remain in 
the pool. Moody’s makes no representation or warranty that such pooling 
agreement will not be modified over time, nor does Moody’s opine on the 
probability that the rated entity may be sold or otherwise removed from the 
pooling agreement. 
Long-Term Insurance Financial 
Strength Ratings 
Moody’s rating symbols for Insurance 
Financial Strength Ratings are identical to those used to indicate the credit 
quality of long-term obligations. These rating gradations provide investors with 
a system for measuring an insurance company’s ability to meet its senior 
policyholder claims and obligations. 
 




Aaa 
Insurance companies 
      rated Aaa offer exceptional financial security. While the credit profile 
      of these companies is likely to change, such changes as can be visualized 
      are most unlikely to impair their fundamentally strong position. 
  
 




Aa 
Insurance companies 
      rated Aa offer excellent financial security. Together with the Aaa group, 
      they constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies. They are 
      rated lower than Aaa companies because long-term risks appear somewhat 
      larger. 
 




A 
Insurance companies 
      rated A offer good financial security. However, elements may be present 
      which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. 
      
 
B-10 






Baa 
Insurance companies 
      rated Baa offer adequate financial security. However, certain protective 
      elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any 
      great length of time. 
 




Ba 
Insurance companies 
      rated Ba offer questionable financial security. Often the ability of these 
      companies to meet policyholder obligations may be very moderate and 
      thereby not well safeguarded in the future. 
 




B 
Insurance companies 
      rated B offer poor financial security. Assurance of punctual payment of 
      policyholder obligations over any long period of time is small. 
  
 




Caa 
Insurance companies 
      rated Caa offer very poor financial security. They may be in default on 
      their policyholder obligations or there may be present elements of danger 
      with respect to punctual payment of policyholder obligations and claims. 
      
 




Ca 
Insurance companies 
      rated Ca offer extremely poor financial security. Such companies are often 
      in default on their policyholder obligations or have other marked 
      shortcomings. 
 




C 
Insurance companies 
      rated C are the lowest-rated class of insurance company and can be 
      regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever offering financial 
      security. 
Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 
1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The 
modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic 
rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 
3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. 

Short-Term Insurance Financial 
Strength Ratings 
Short-Term Insurance Financial 
Strength Ratings are opinions of the ability of the insurance company to repay 
punctually its short-term senior policyholder claims and obligations. The 
ratings apply to senior policyholder obligations that mature or are payable 
within one year or less. 
Specific obligations are considered 
unrated unless individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance 
obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those 
laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. 
 




P-1 
Insurers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability for 
      repayment of senior short-term policyholder claims and obligations. 
    
 




P-2 
Insurers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability for repayment 
      of senior short-term policyholder claims and obligations. 
  
 




P-3 
Insurers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability for 
      repayment of senior short-term policyholder claims and obligations. 
    
 




NP 
Insurers (or 
      supporting institutions) rated Not Prime (NP) do not fall within any of 
      the Prime rating categories. 
When ratings are supported by the 
credit of another entity or entities, then the name or names of such supporting 
entity or entities are listed within parenthesis beneath the name of the 
insurer, or there is a footnote referring to the name or names of the supporting 
entity or entities. 
In assigning ratings to such 
insurers, Moody’s evaluates the financial strength of the affiliated insurance 
companies, commercial banks, corporations, foreign governments, or other 
entities, but only as one factor in the total rating assessment. Moody’s makes 
no representation and gives no opinion on the legal validity or enforceability 
of any support arrangement. 
S&P 
Insurer Financial Strength Rating 
Definitions 
A S&P’s insurer financial 
strength rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security 
characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay 
under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. 
Insurer financial strength ratings are also assigned to health maintenance 
organizations and similar health plans with respect to their ability to pay 
under their policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. 
 
B-11 


This opinion is not specific to any 
particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a 
particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Furthermore, 
the opinion does not take into account deductibles, surrender or cancellation 
penalties, timeliness of payment, nor the likelihood of the use of a defense 
such as fraud to deny claims. For organizations with cross-border or 
multinational operations, including those conducted by subsidiaries or branch 
offices, the ratings do not take into account potential that may exist for 
foreign exchange restrictions to prevent financial obligations from being met. 

Insurer financial strength ratings 
do not refer to an organization’s ability to meet nonpolicy (i.e. debt) 
obligations. Assignment of ratings to debt issued by insurers or to debt issues 
that are fully or partially supported by insurance policies, contracts, or 
guarantees is a separate process from the determination of insurer financial 
strength ratings, and follows procedures consistent with issue credit rating 
definitions and practices. An insurer financial strength rating is not a 
recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by an 
insurer. 
Long-Term Insurer Financial 
Strength Ratings 
An insurer rated ‘BBB’ or higher is 
regarded as having financial security characteristics that outweigh any 
vulnerabilities, and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial 
commitments. 
 




AAA 
An insurer rated 
      ‘AAA’ has extremely strong financial security characteristics. ‘AAA’ is 
      the highest insurer financial strength rating assigned by S&P. 
    
 




AA 
An insurer rated 
      ‘AA’ has very strong financial security characteristics, differing only 
      slightly from those rated higher. 
 




A 
An insurer rated ‘A’ 
      has strong financial security characteristics, but is somewhat more likely 
      to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with 
      higher ratings. 
 




BBB 
An insurer rated 
      ‘BBB’ has good financial security characteristics, but is more likely to 
      be affected by adverse business conditions than are higher-rated insurers. 
      
An insurer rated ‘BB’ or lower is 
regarded as having vulnerable characteristics that may outweigh its strengths; 
‘BB’ indicates the least degree of vulnerability within the range; ‘CC’ the 
highest. 
 




BB 
An insurer rated 
      ‘BB’ has marginal financial security characteristics. Positive attributes 
      exist, but adverse business conditions could lead to insufficient ability 
      to meet financial commitments. 
 




B 
An insurer rated ‘B’ 
      has weak financial security characteristics. Adverse business conditions 
      will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments. 
  
 




CCC 
An insurer rated 
      ‘CCC’ has very weak financial security characteristics, and is dependent 
      on favorable business conditions to meet financial commitments. 
  
 




CC 
An insurer rated 
      ‘CC’ has extremely weak financial security characteristics and is likely 
      not to meet some of its financial commitments. 
 




R 
An insurer rated ‘R’ 
      is under regulatory supervision owing to its financial condition. During 
      the pendency of the regulatory supervision, the regulators may have the 
      power to favor one class of obligations over others or pay some 
      obligations and not others. The rating does not apply to insurers subject 
      only to nonfinancial actions such as market conduct violations. 
  
 




NR 
An insurer 
      designated ‘NR’ is not rated, which implies no opinion about the insurer’s 
      financial security. 
Ratings from ‘AA’ to ‘CCC’ may be 
modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the 
major rating categories. 
Fitch 
Insurer Financial Strength 
Ratings 
The Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) 
Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance 
organization. The IFS Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder 
obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder 
obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. The IFS Rating reflects 
both the ability of the insurer to meet these obligations on a timely basis, and 
expected recoveries received 
 
B-12 


by claimants in the event the 
insurer stops making payments or payments are interrupted, due to either the 
failure of the insurer or some form of regulatory intervention. In the context 
of the IFS Rating, the timeliness of payments is considered relative to both 
contract and/or policy terms but also recognizes the possibility of reasonable 
delays caused by circumstances common to the insurance industry, including 
claims reviews, fraud investigations and coverage disputes. 
The IFS Rating does not encompass 
policyholder obligations residing in separate accounts, unit-linked products or 
segregated funds, for which the policyholder bears investment or other risks. 
However, any guarantees provided to the policyholder with respect to such 
obligations are included in the IFS Rating. 
Expected recoveries are based on the 
agency’s assessments of the sufficiency of an insurance company’s assets to fund 
policyholder obligations, in a scenario in which payments have ceased or been 
interrupted. Accordingly, expected recoveries exclude the impact of recoveries 
obtained from any government sponsored guaranty or policyholder protection 
funds. Expected recoveries also exclude the impact of collateralization or 
security, such as letters of credit or trusteed assets, supporting select 
reinsurance obligations. 
IFS Ratings can be assigned to 
insurance and reinsurance companies in any insurance sector, including the 
life & annuity, non-life, 
property/casualty, health, mortgage, financial guaranty, residual value and 
title insurance sectors, as well as to managed care companies such as health 
maintenance organizations. 
The IFS Rating does not address the 
quality of an insurer’s claims handling services or the relative value of 
products sold. 
The IFS Rating uses the same symbols 
used by the agency for its International and National credit ratings of 
long-term or short-term debt issues. However, the definitions associated with 
the ratings reflect the unique aspects of the IFS Rating within an insurance 
industry context. 
Obligations for which a payment 
interruption has occurred due to either the insolvency or failure of the insurer 
or some form of regulatory intervention will generally be rated between ‘B’ and 
‘C’ on the Long-Term IFS Rating scales (both International and National). 
International Short-Term IFS Ratings assigned under the same circumstances will 
align with the insurer’s International Long-Term IFS Rating. 
Long-Term International IFS 
Ratings 
The following rating scale applies 
to foreign currency and local currency ratings. Ratings of ‘BBB-’ and higher are considered to be 
“secure”, and those of ‘BB+’ and lower are considered to be “vulnerable”. 

 




AAA 
EXCEPTIONALLY 
      STRONG. ‘AAA’ IFS Ratings denote the lowest expectation of ceased or 
      interrupted payments. They are assigned only in the case of exceptionally 
      strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This 
      capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable 
      events. 
 




AA 
VERY STRONG. ‘AA’ 
      IFS Ratings denote a very low expectation of ceased or interrupted 
      payments. They indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and 
      contract obligations. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to 
      foreseeable events. 
 




A 
STRONG. ‘A’ IFS 
      Ratings denote a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They 
      indicate strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. 
      This capacity may, nonetheless, be more vulnerable to changes in 
      circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher 
      ratings. 
 




BBB 
GOOD. ‘BBB’ IFS 
      Ratings indicate that there is currently a low expectation of ceased or 
      interrupted payments. The capacity to meet policyholder and contract 
      obligations on a timely basis is considered adequate, but adverse changes 
      in circumstances and economic conditions are more likely to impact this 
      capacity. 
 




BB 
MODERATELY WEAK. 
      ‘BB’ IFS Ratings indicate that there is an elevated vulnerability to 
      ceased or interrupted payments, particularly as the result of adverse 
      economic or market changes over time. However, business or financial 
      alternatives may be available to allow for policyholder and contract 
      obligations to be met in a timely manner. 
 




B 

WEAK. ‘B’ IFS Ratings 
      indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a 
      timely basis, there is significant risk that ceased or interrupted 
      payments could occur in the future, but a limited margin of safety 
      remains. Capacity for continued timely payments is contingent upon 
      
 
B-13 





 

a sustained, favorable 
      business and economic environment, and favorable market conditions. 
      Alternatively, a ‘B’ IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have 
      experienced ceased or interrupted payments, but with the potential for 
      extremely high recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery 
      assessment of ‘RR1’ (Outstanding). 
 




CCC, 
VERY WEAK. ‘CCC’ IFS 
      Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being 
      met on a timely basis, there is a real possibility that ceased or 
      interrupted payments could occur in the future. Capacity for continued 
      timely payments is solely reliant upon a sustained, favorable business and 
      economic environment, and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, a 
      ‘CCC’ IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased 
      or interrupted payments, and with the potential for average to superior 
      recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of ‘RR2’ 
      (Superior), ‘RR3’ (Good), and ‘RR4’ (Average). 
 




CC 
EXTREMELY WEAK. ‘CC’ 
      IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still 
      being met on a timely basis, it is probable that ceased or interrupted 
      payments will occur in the future. Alternatively, a ‘CC’ IFS Rating is 
      assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted 
      payments, with the potential for average to below-average recoveries. Such 
      obligations would possess a recovery assessment of ‘RR4’ (Average) or 
      ‘RR5’ (Below Average). 
 




C 
DISTRESSED. ‘C’ IFS 
      Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being 
      met on a timely basis, ceased or interrupted payments are imminent. 
      Alternatively, a ‘C’ IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have 
      experienced ceased or interrupted payments, and with the potential for 
      below average to poor recoveries. Such obligations would possess a 
      recovery assessment of ‘RR5’ (Below Average) or ‘RR6’ (Poor). 
  
“+” or “-” may be appended to a rating to indicate 
the relative position of a credit within the rating category. Such suffixes are 
not added to ratings in the ‘AAA’ category or to ratings below the ‘B’ category. 

Short-Term IFS Ratings 

A Short-Term Insurer Financial 
Strength Rating (ST-IFS Rating) 
provides an assessment of the near-term financial health of an insurance 
organization, and its capacity to meet senior obligations to policyholders and 
contract-holders that would be expected to be due within one year. The analysis 
supporting the ST-IFS Rating 
encompasses all of the factors considered within the context of the IFS Rating, 
but with greater weighting given to an insurer’s near-term liquidity, financial 
flexibility and regulatory solvency characteristics, and less weight given to 
longer-term issues such as competitiveness and earnings trends. 
The agency will only assign a ST-IFS Rating to insurers that also have been 
assigned an IFS Rating. Currently, ST-IFS Ratings are used primarily by U.S. 
life insurance companies that sell short-term funding agreements. 
The ST-IFS Rating uses the same international 
ratings scale used by the agency for short-term debt and issuer ratings. 

 




F1 
Insurers are viewed 
      as having a strong capacity to meet their near-term obligations. When an 
      insurer rated in this rating category is designated with a (+) sign, it is 
      viewed as having a very strong capacity to meet near-term obligations. 
      
 




F2 
Insurers are viewed 
      as having a moderately strong capacity to meet their near-term 
      obligations. 
 




F3 
Insurers are viewed 
      as having an adequate capacity to meet their near-term obligations. 
    
 




B 
Insurers are viewed 
      as having a weak capacity to meet their near-term obligations. 
  
 




C 
Insurers are viewed 
      as having a very weak capacity to meet their near-term obligations. 
    
Recovery Ratings 
Recovery Ratings are assigned to 
selected individual securities and obligations. These currently are published 
for most individual obligations of corporate issuers with IDRs in the ‘B’ rating 
category and below, and for most distressed or defaulted structured finance 
obligations rated “CCC” or below. 
Among the factors that affect 
recovery rates for securities are the collateral, the seniority relative to 
other obligations in the capital structure (where appropriate), and the expected 
value of the company or underlying collateral in distress. 
 
B-14 


The Recovery Rating scale is based 
upon the expected relative recovery characteristics of an obligation upon the 
curing of a default, emergence from insolvency or following the liquidation or 
termination of the obligor or its associated collateral. For structured finance, 
Recovery Ratings are designed to estimate recoveries on a forward-looking basis 
while taking into account the time value of money. 
Recovery Ratings are an ordinal 
scale and do not attempt to precisely predict a given level of recovery. As a 
guideline in developing the rating assessments, the agency employs broad 
theoretical recovery bands in its ratings approach based on historical averages, 
but actual recoveries for a given security may deviate materially from 
historical averages. 
 




RR1 
OUTSTANDING RECOVERY 
      PROSPECTS GIVEN DEFAULT. ‘RR1’ rated securities have characteristics 
      consistent with securities historically recovering 91%–100% of current 
      principal and related interest. 
 




RR2 
SUPERIOR RECOVERY 
      PROSPECTS GIVEN DEFAULT. ‘RR2’ rated securities have characteristics 
      consistent with securities historically recovering 71%–90% of current 
      principal and related interest. 
 




RR3 
GOOD RECOVERY 
      PROSPECTS GIVEN DEFAULT. ‘RR3’ rated securities have characteristics 
      consistent with securities historically recovering 51%–70% of current 
      principal and related interest. 
 




RR4 
AVERAGE RECOVERY 
      PROSPECTS GIVEN DEFAULT. ‘RR4’ rated securities have characteristics 
      consistent with securities historically recovering 31%–50% of current 
      principal and related interest. 
 




RR5 
BELOW AVERAGE 
      RECOVERY PROSPECTS GIVEN DEFAULT. ‘RR5’ rated securities have 
      characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering 11%–30% 
      of current principal and related interest. 
 




RR6 
POOR RECOVERY 
      PROSPECTS GIVEN DEFAULT. ‘RR6’ rated securities have characteristics 
      consistent with securities historically recovering 0%–10% of current 
      principal and related interest. 
Limitations of the Recovery 
Ratings Scale 
Specific limitations relevant to the 
Recovery Ratings scale include: 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not predict a specific percentage of recovery should a default 
      occur. 
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer’s securities or 
      stock, or the likelihood that this value may change. 
  
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer’s securities or stock. 
      
 



 
•
 

The 
      ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer or transaction’s 
      profile other than the agency’s opinion on the relative loss severity of 
      the rated obligation should the obligation default. 
  
Recovery Ratings, in particular, 
reflect a fundamental analysis of the underlying relationship between financial 
claims on an entity or transaction and potential sources to meet those claims. 
The size of such sources and claims is subject to a wide variety of dynamic 
factors outside the agency’s analysis, which will influence actual recovery 
rates. 
DESCRIPTION OF SHORT-TERM 
MUNICIPAL BOND RATINGS 
Moody’s 
Short-Term Obligation Ratings 

There are three rating categories 
for short-term municipal obligations that are considered investment grade. These 
ratings are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG) and are divided into 
three levels — MIG 1 through MIG 3. In addition, those short-term obligations 
that are of speculative quality are designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG 
ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation. 
 




MIG 1 
This designation 
      denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by 
      established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support or demonstrated 
      broad-based access to the market for refinancing. 

 
B-15 






MIG 2 
This designation 
      denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample although 
      not so large as in the preceding group. 
 




MIG 3 
This designation 
      denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may 
      be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less 
      well-established. 
 




SG 
This designation 
      denotes speculative-quality credit quality. Debt instruments in this 
      category may lack sufficient margins of protection. 

Demand Obligation Ratings 

In the case of variable rate demand 
obligations (VRDOs), a two-component 
rating is assigned; a long or short-term debt rating and a demand obligation 
rating. The first element represents Moody’s evaluation of the degree of risk 
associated with scheduled principal and interest payments. The second element 
represents Moody’s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the ability 
to receive purchase price upon demand (“demand feature”), using a variation of 
the MIG rating scale, the Variable Municipal Investment Grade or VMIG rating. 

When either the long- or short-term aspect of a VRDO is not 
rated, that piece is designated NR, e.g., Aaa/NR or NR/VMIG 1. 
VMIG rating expirations are a 
function of each issue’s specific structural or credit features. 
 




VMIG 1 
This designation 
      denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by the 
      superior short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and 
      structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of 
      purchase price upon demand. 
 




VMIG 2 
This designation 
      denotes strong credit quality. Good protection is afforded by the strong 
      short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and 
      legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon 
      demand. 
 




VMIG 3 
This designation 
      denotes acceptable credit quality. Adequate protection is afforded by the 
      satisfactory short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and 
      structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of 
      purchase price upon demand. 
 




SG 
This designation 
      denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Demand features rated in this 
      category may be supported by a liquidity provider that does not have an 
      investment grade short-term rating or may lack the structural and/or legal 
      protections necessary to ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon 
      demand. 
S&P 
Municipal Short-Term Note Ratings 

A S&P’s U.S. municipal note 
rating reflects S&P’s opinion about the liquidity factors and market access 
risks unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive 
a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more than three years will 
most likely receive a long-term debt rating. In determining which type of 
rating, if any, to assign, S&P’s analysis will review the following 
considerations: 
 



 
•
 

Amortization schedule — the larger the final maturity relative to 
      other maturities, the more likely it will be treated as a note; and 
      
 



 
•
 

Source of 
      payment — the more dependent the issue is on the market for its 
      refinancing, the more likely it will be treated as a note. 
  
Note rating symbols are as follows: 

 




SP-1 
Strong capacity to 
      pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong 
      capacity to pay debt service is given a plus (+) designation. 
  
 




SP-2 
Satisfactory 
      capacity to pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse 
      financial and economic changes over the term of the notes. 
  
 




SP-3 
Speculative capacity 
      to pay principal and interest. 
 
B-16 


DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK 
RATINGS 
DBRS 
Preferred Share Rating Scale 

The DBRS preferred share rating 
scale is used in the Canadian securities market and is meant to give an 
indication of the risk that a borrower will not fulfill its full obligations in 
a timely manner, with respect to both dividend and principal commitments. Every 
DBRS rating is based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to 
the borrowing entity. Each rating category is denoted by the subcategories 
“high” and “low”. The absence of either a “high” or “low” designation indicates 
the rating is in the middle of the category. This scale may also apply to 
certain hybrid securities, in which case references to dividend throughout will 
reflect interest commitments of the hybrid security. 
 




Pfd-1 
Preferred shares 
      rated Pfd-1 are of superior 
      credit quality, and are supported by entities with strong earnings and 
      balance sheet characteristics. Pfd-1 securities generally correspond 
      with companies whose senior bonds are rated in the AAA or AA categories. 
      As is the case with all rating categories, the relationship between senior 
      debt ratings and preferred share ratings should be understood as one where 
      the senior debt rating effectively sets a ceiling for the preferred shares 
      issued by the entity. However, there are cases where the preferred share 
      rating could be lower than the normal relationship with the issuer’s 
      senior debt rating. 
 




Pfd-2 
Preferred shares 
      rated Pfd-2 are of satisfactory credit quality. Protection of dividends 
      and principal is still substantial, but earnings, the balance sheet, and 
      coverage ratios are not as strong as Pfd-1 rated companies. Generally, 
      Pfd-2 ratings correspond with companies whose senior bonds are rated in 
      the “A” category. 
 




Pfd-3 
Preferred shares 
      rated Pfd-3 are of adequate credit quality. While protection of dividends 
      and principal is still considered acceptable, the issuing entity is more 
      susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions, and 
      there may be other adverse conditions present which detract from debt 
      protection. Pfd-3 ratings generally correspond with companies whose senior 
      bonds are rated in the higher end of the BBB category. 
  
 




Pfd-4 
Preferred shares 
      rated Pfd-4 are speculative, where the degree of protection afforded to 
      dividends and principal is uncertain, particularly during periods of 
      economic adversity. Companies with preferred shares rated Pfd-4 generally 
      coincide with entities that have senior bond ratings ranging from the 
      lower end of the BBB category through the BB category. 
  
 




Pfd-5 
Preferred shares 
      rated Pfd-5 are highly speculative and the ability of the entity to 
      maintain timely dividend and principal payments in the future is highly 
      uncertain. Entities with a Pfd-5 rating generally have senior bond ratings 
      of B or lower. Preferred shares rated Pfd-5 often have characteristics 
      that, if not remedied, may lead to default. 
 




D 
A security rated D 
      implies the dividend or principal payment is in default per the legal 
      documents, the issuer has made it clear that this will be the case in the 
      near future or in certain cases, that there has been a distressed 
      exchange. As such, the non payment of a dividend does not necessarily give 
      rise to the assignment of a D rating. In some cases, DBRS may not assign a 
      D rating under a bankruptcy announcement scenario, as allowances for grace 
      periods may exist in the underlying legal documentation. Once assigned, 
      the D rating will continue until such time as the rating is discontinued 
      or reinstated by DBRS.
