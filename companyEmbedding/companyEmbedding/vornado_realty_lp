(the "Operating Partnership" and/or the "Company") is a Delaware limited partnership. Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 94.1% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2014. All references to "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Operating Partnership" refer to Vornado Realty L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225 million of cash to Urban Edge Properties ("UE")

We are providing transition services to UE for an initial period of up to two years, including information technology, human resources, tax and public reporting. UE is providing us with leasing and property management services for (i) the Monmouth Mall, (ii) certain small retail properties which did not fit UE's strategy that we plan to sell, and  We own and operate office and retail properties (our "core" operations) with large concentrations in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander's, Inc.

("Toys") as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.  Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to Vornado's shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado's performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index ("Office REIT") and the Morgan Stanley REIT Index ("RMS") for the following periods ended December 31, 2014:   Total Return(1) Vornado Office REIT RMS Three-months 18.5% 12.7% 14.3% One-year 36.4% 25.9% 30.4% Three-year 70.8% 51.7% 57.3% Five-year 100.6% 78.2% 119.7% Ten-year 131.1% 89.5% 122.2%  (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through:  ****** Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit  ****** Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation  ****** Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents  ****** Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area  ****** Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value  ****** Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component  We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these units or any other securities in the future.  We compete with a large number of property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Overview - continued  Acquisitions  On June 26, 2014, we invested an additional $22,700,000 to increase our ownership in One Park Avenue to 55.0% from 46.5% through a joint venture with an institutional investor, who increased its ownership interest to 45.0%. The transaction was based on a property value of $560,000,000. The property is encumbered by a $250,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan that bears interest at 4.995% and matures in March 2016.  On July 23, 2014, a joint venture in which we are a 50.1% partner entered into a 99-year ground lease for 61 Ninth Avenue located on the Southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in Manhattan. The venture's current plans are to construct an office building, with retail at the base, of approximately 130,000 square feet. Total development costs are currently estimated to be approximately $125,000,000.  On August 1, 2014, we acquired the land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property located on the Southeast corner of 58th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, for $63,000,000.  On October 28, 2014, we completed the purchase of the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel for $700,000,000. We own a 74.3% controlling interest of the joint venture which owns the property. The acquisition was used in a like-kind exchange for income tax purposes for the sale of 1740 Broadway (see below). We consolidate the accounts of the venture into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  On November 21, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Center Building, an eight story 437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, New York. The building is 98% leased. The purchase price is approximately $142,000,000, including the assumption of an existing $62,000,000 4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018. The purchase is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. As of December 31, 2014, our $14,200,000 non-refundable deposit was included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet.  On January 20, 2015, we co-invested with our 25% owned Fund and one of the Fund's limited partners to buy out the Fund's joint venture partner's 57% interest in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. The purchase price for the 57% interest was approximately $95,000,000 (our share $39,000,000) which valued the property at approximately $480,000,000. The property is encumbered by a newly placed $310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.80% and maturing in December 2018 with a one-year extension option. Our aggregate ownership interest in the property increased to 33% from 11%.  Dispositions  New York  On December 18, 2014, we completed the sale of 1740 Broadway, a 601,000 square foot office building in Manhattan for $605,000,000. The sale resulted in net proceeds of approximately $580,000,000, after closing costs, and resulted in a financial statement gain of approximately $441,000,000. The tax gain of approximately $484,000,000, was deferred in like-kind exchanges, primarily for the acquisition of the St. Regis Fifth Avenue retail.  Retail Properties  On February 24, 2014, we completed the sale of Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island, New York, for $94,000,000. The sale resulted in net proceeds of $92,174,000 after closing costs.  On March 2, 2014, we entered into an agreement to transfer upon completion, the redeveloped Springfield Town Center, a 1,350,000 square foot mall located in Springfield, Fairfax County, Virginia, to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust

                                         ("PREIT") in exchange for $465,000,000 comprised of $340,000,000 of cash and $125,000,000 of PREIT operating partnership units. In connection therewith, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $20,000,000 in the first quarter of 2014, which is included in "income from discontinued operations" on our consolidated statements of income. The redevelopment was substantially completed in October 2014, at which time we reclassified the assets, liabilities and financial results to discontinued operations, and the transfer of the property to PREIT is expected to be completed no later than March 31, 2015.  On July 8, 2014, we completed the sale of Beverly Connection, a 335,000 square foot power shopping center in Los Angeles, California, for $260,000,000, of which $239,000,000 was cash and $21,000,000 was 10-year mezzanine seller financing. The sale resulted in a net gain of $44,155,000, which was recognized in the third quarter of 2014.  In addition to the above, during 2014, we sold six of the 22 strip shopping centers which did not fit UE's strategy, in separate transactions, for an aggregate of $66,410,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain aggregating $22,500,000.  Overview - continued  Financings  Secured Debt  On January 31, 2014, we completed a $600,000,000 loan secured by our 220 Central Park South development site. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% (2.92% at December 31, 2014) and matures in January 2016, with three one-year extension options.  On April 16, 2014, we completed a $350,000,000 refinancing of 909 Third Avenue, a 1.3 million square foot Manhattan office building. The seven-year interest only loan bears interest at 3.91% and matures in May 2021. We realized net proceeds of approximately $145,000,000 after defeasing the existing 5.64%, $193,000,000 mortgage, defeasance cost and other closing costs.  On July 16, 2014, we completed a $130,000,000 financing of Las Catalinas, a 494,000 square foot mall located in the San Juan area of Puerto Rico. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 4.43% and matures in August 2024. The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year six.  On August 12, 2014, we completed a $185,000,000 financing of the Universal buildings, a 690,000 square foot, two-building office complex located in Washington, DC. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.90% (2.06% at December 31, 2014) and matures in August 2019 with two one-year extension options. The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year.  On August 26, 2014, we obtained a standby commitment for up to $500,000,000 of five-year mezzanine loan financing to fund a portion of the development expenditures at 220 Central Park South.  On October 27, 2014, we completed a $140,000,000 financing of 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square foot retail and office property. The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.56% at December 31, 2014) and matures in October 2019 with two one-year extension options.  On December 8, 2014, we completed a $575,000,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office building. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.65% (1.81% at December 31, 2014) and matures in 2019 with two one-year extension options. We realized net proceeds of approximately $143,000,000. Pursuant to an existing swap agreement, the $422,000,000 previous loan on the property was swapped to a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018. Therefore, $422,000,000 of the new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018 and the balance of $153,000,000 floats through March 2018. The entire $575,000,000 will float thereafter for the duration of the new loan.  On January 6, 2015, we completed the modification of the $120,000,000, 6.04% mortgage loan secured by our Montehiedra Town Center, in the San Juan area of Puerto Rico. The loan has been extended from July 2016 to July 2021 and separated into two tranches, a senior $90,000,000 position with interest at 5.33% to be paid currently, and a junior $30,000,000 position with interest accruing at 3%. Montehiedra Town Center and the loan were included in the spin-off to UE on January 15, 2015. As part of the planned redevelopment of the property, UE is committed to fund $20,000,000 through a loan for leasing and building capital expenditures of which $8,000,000 has been funded. This loan is senior to the $30,000,000 position noted above and accrues interest at 10%.  Senior Unsecured Notes  On June 16, 2014, we completed a green bond public offering of $450,000,000 2.50% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2019. The notes were sold at 99.619% of their face amount to yield 2.581%.  On October 1, 2014, we redeemed all of the $445,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 7.875% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on October 1, 2039, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through the redemption date. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off $12,532,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs, which are included as a component of "interest and debt expense" on our consolidated statements of income.  On January 1, 2015, we redeemed all of the $500,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 4.25% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2015, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through December 31, 2014.  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility  On September 30, 2014, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from November 2015 to November 2018 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered to LIBOR plus 105 basis points from LIBOR plus 125 basis points and the facility fee was reduced to 20 basis points from 25 basis points.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Page Number Overview 40 Overview - Leasing activity 47 Critical Accounting Policies 51 Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 54 Results of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to December 31, 2015 58 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014 65 Supplemental Information: Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 72 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to December 31, 2015 76 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2016 78 Related Party Transactions 80 Liquidity and Capital Resources 81 Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations 82 Certain Future Cash Requirements 84 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 87 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 89 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 91 Funds From Operations for the Three Months and Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 93  Overview  Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") is a fully�integrated real estate investment trust ("REIT") and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). Accordingly, Vornado's cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.7% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2016. All references to the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.  On October 31, 2016, Vornado's Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies ("JBG"), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be named JBG SMITH Properties. Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company. The pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata 1:2 basis. The initial Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new company's listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution by Vornado's Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination are not subject to a vote by Vornado's shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. Vornado's Board of Trustees has approved the transaction. JBG has obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this transaction. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be completed.  We own and operate office and retail properties with large concentrations in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC/Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander's, Inc. ("Alexander's")

                                         which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, a 32.5% interest in Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.  Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado's performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index ("Office REIT") and the MSCI US REIT Index ("MSCI") for the following periods ended December 31, 2016:   Total Return(1) Vornado Office REIT MSCI Three-month 3.9% 0.6% (3.0%) One-year 7.3% 13.2% 8.6% Three-year 40.6% 42.8% 45.2% Five-year 76.0% 72.1% 75.2% Ten-year 36.9% 31.0% 62.3%  (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  Overview - continued  We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through:  ****** maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;  ****** investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;  ****** acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;  ****** investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;  ****** developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and  * investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.  We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.  We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

(4) Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, same store EBITDA increased by 3.6% and by 7.6% on a cash basis.  Calculations of same store EBITDA, reconciliations of our net income to EBITDA and FFO and the reasons we consider these non-GAAP financial measures useful are provided in the following pages of Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Overview - continued  Washington, DC Segment  Excluding the Skyline Properties which were disposed of on December 21, 2016, our Washington, DC segment EBITDA as adjusted was $290,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is flat to 2015 as a result of an increase in EBITDA from the core business of $3,100,000, offset by a decline in EBITDA from properties taken out-of-service of $3,100,000. These results are slightly ahead of the guidance we published for 2016.  We expect to complete the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment in the second quarter of 2017. We expect that Washington, DC's EBITDA as adjusted during the first half of 2017 will be lower than the first half of 2016 by approximately $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, comprised of:  (i) core business approximately $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 higher than 2016, offset by,  (ii) reduction in EBITDA of approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 from 1700 M Street, 1800 South Bell and 1750 Crystal Drive being taken out-of-service for redevelopment.  Investments  On March 17, 2016, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 33.3% interest, which owns a $150,000,000 mezzanine loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.88% and an initial maturity date in November 2016, with two three-month extension options. On November 9, 2016, the mezzanine loan was extended to May 2017 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 9.42% (10.08% at December 31, 2016) during the extension period. As of December 31, 2016, the joint venture has fully funded its commitments. The joint venture's investment is subordinate to $350,000,000 of third party debt. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method.  On May 20, 2016, we contributed $19,650,000 for a 50.0% equity interest in a joint venture that will develop 606 Broadway, a 34,000 square foot office and retail building, located on Houston Street in Manhattan. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $104,000,000. At closing, the joint venture obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year extension options. Because this joint venture is a VIE and we determined we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture from the date of our investment.  Dispositions  On May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street, a 479,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon, and retained the remaining 53% interest. This transaction was based on a property value of approximately $561,000,000 or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127,382,000 from the sale and realized a net gain of $203,324,000, of which $159,511,000 was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 and is included in "net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" in our consolidated statements of income. The remaining net gain of $43,813,000 has been deferred until our guarantee of payment of loan principal and interest is removed or the loan is repaid. We realized a net tax gain of $90,017,000. We continue to manage and lease the property. We share control over major decisions with our joint venture partner. Accordingly, this property is accounted for under the equity method from the date of sale.  On December 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our 20% interest in Fairfax . . .

amortized to $149,000,000 at maturity in 2013.

Retail

Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice PresidentRetail, and his team contributed full measure to Vornados great 2006. Retail leased 1.2 million square feet, twice the scheduled expiries, at an
amazing 33% mark-to-market. Sandeeps pace of acquisitions accelerated to over $900 million in 2006, investing in great assets like Springfield Mall, Manhattan Mall, and the Virgin Times Square block front. Milestones include the first ever
JCPenney store in Manhattan, Rego Parks(3) groundbreaking scheduled for May and Bergen Town Centers approvals and
construction start. The retail group currently has 28 separate projects in the development pipeline or under construction, see Appendix III. Welcome to Steve Cassella and Peter Michelis.

Beverly Connection
 
On March 5, 2005, we acquired a 50% interest in a venture that owns Beverly Connection, a two-level urban shopping center, containing 322,000 square feet, located in Los Angeles, California for $10,700,000 in cash.  We also provided the venture with a $59,500,000 first mortgage loan which bore interest at 10% through its scheduled maturity in February 2006 and $35,000,000 of preferred equity yielding 13.5% for up to a three-year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000 of other preferred equity and debt.  On February 11, 2006, $35,000,000 of our loan to the venture was converted to additional preferred equity on the same terms as our existing preferred equity and the maturity date of the loan was extended. On June 30, 2006, the venture completed a $100,000,000 refinancing and repaid to us the remaining $24,500,000 balance of the loan. The ventures new loan bears interest at LIBOR
(capped at 5.5%) plus 2.20% (7.5% as of December 31, 2006) and matures in July 2008 with 3 one-year extension options.  The venture is redeveloping the existing retail and plans, subject to governmental approvals, to develop residential condominiums and assisted living facilities.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method.
 
Westbury Retail Condominium, New York City
 
On May 20, 2005, we acquired the retail condominium of the former Westbury Hotel in Manhattan for $113,000,000 in cash.  Simultaneously with the closing, we completed an $80,000,000 mortgage financing secured by the property, which bears interest at 5.292% and matures in 2018.  The property contains approximately 17,000 square feet of retail space.  We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  
 
40 East 66th Street, New York City
 
On July 25, 2005, we acquired 40 East 66th Street for $158,000,000 in cash.

yielding 13.5% for up to a three-year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000

This excerpt taken from the VNO 8-K filed Apr 27, 2005.Retail  
        Our retail business is flourishing under Sandeep's leadership. His numbers are greatRetail EBITDA increased $25 million this year; same store
increased 5.5%. 
        Redevelopment
of existing assets, especially large complex retail properties, continues to be a terrific business for us and is a favorite of mine. Here are some highlights: 
        In
December 2003, we paid $145 million to acquire the Bergen Mall, a 900,000 square foot fixer-upper on eighty acres in Paramus, New Jersey. We spent 2004 in the design,
planning and pre-leasing phase. It is an indication of how completely we intend to reconfigure and reposition this asset that we have canceled both a 139,000 square foot Value City lease
paying $12 million and a 338,000 square foot Macy's lease receiving $2 million. We plan to redevelop this property into a lifestyle center and will invest at least an additional
$100 million. In March 2005, we formally submitted our plans to the borough of Paramus, beginning an expected one-year approval process. 
        We
recently obtained approvals to add 190,000 square feet of freestanding boxes to our Green Acres super regional mall in Valley Stream, Long Island. Immediately after the Christmas
selling season, we will begin these physical additions, as well as a full cosmetic renovation of the interior mall. 
        In
March 2005, we purchased a 50% interest in Beverly Connection, a two-level shopping center located directly across from Beverly Center regional mall in Los Angeles,
California. Our shopping center contains approximately 322,000 square feet and a parking structure with over 1,500 spaces. The venture intends to redevelop the property and add retail, residential
condominiums and assisted living facilities. This project is subject to governmental approvals. 
        Sandeep's
retail group, working closely with Michelle's acquisitions group, Joe, Wendy, Alan and Mike and me, was the first line of responsibility in analyzing the megadeals: Toys "R"
Us, Sears and Mervyn's. Going forward, all our senior management will be involved in Toys "R" Us, but Sandeep's group will spearhead the real estate side.
