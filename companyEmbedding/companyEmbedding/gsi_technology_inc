Product FAQ










Why are the address pins on GSI Technology parts not numbered? 

Except for the address pins that preload the address counter in synchronous SRAMs equipped with a burst counter, there is no functional significance to address pin order or “weight”. JEDEC pinout standards for SRAMs do not cite specific address pin order. See Technical Note AN1008.
		 


Why are the data pins on GSI Technology parts not numbered?

There is no functional significance to data pin order or “weight”. JEDEC pinout standards for SRAMs do not cite specific data pin order. See Technical Note AN1008.
		 


What are DQPx pins?

SRAMs offered in x8 vs. x9, x16 vs. x18, x32 vs. x36, or x64 vs. x72 versions which share very similar pinouts. The DQPx marking identifies the data pins on x9, x18, x36 and x72 SRAMs that become NC (no connect) pins when the part is offered in x8, x16, x32 or x64 form.
		 


Are NC (No Connect) pins truly not connected to the die?

NC pins are not connected to the die.
		 


Can MCH (Must Connect High) pins be connected directly to VDD?

Yes, but the best practice is to tie through a 1K ohm resistor.
		 


Can MCL pins be connected directly to VSS?

Yes, but best practice is to tie through a 1K ohm resistor.
		 


Are there any errata associated with the engineering version (ES) of the part I am using?

This depends on the part you are using. Contact your GSI representative for details regarding Engineering Samples of the particular device of interest.
		 


Whom do I contact for Technical support?

Whom do I contact for technical information on GSI components?

apps@gsitechnology.com
		 


Whom do I contact for Sales related questions?

Visit our sales page  to find your local GSI sales representative.
		 


If I am having problems with interfacing a device in my design whom can I contact?

apps@gsitechnology.com
		 


If I have questions about which GSI parts are going to be best suited for my design, whom can I contact?

SyncBurst SRAMs












GSI offers the broadest portfolio of Synchronous Burst (SyncBurst™) SRAMs in the industry. Our SyncBurst SRAMs provide the fastest clock rates and lowest power of any in the world.

SyncBurst SRAMs provide a “burst” of (typically) 2 to 4 words in response to a single clock signal. SyncBurst SRAMs are used in networking, industrial, automotive and medical imaging applications where a mid-range performance point (typically a 333–166 MHz clock rate) is required.

SUNNYVALE, Calif. & SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GSI 
      Technology (GSI) (NASDAQ: GSIT), a leader in high-performance 
      synchronous SRAM and low-latency DRAM products for the network and 
      telecom markets, and MoSys 
      (NASDAQ: MOSY), a leader in semiconductor solutions that enable fast, 
      intelligent data access for network and communications systems, today 
      announced a dual-sourcing product and technology partnership. The 
      partnership includes alternate sourcing of the GSI SigmaQuad™ 
      IVe SRAM family and the MoSys® Bandwidth 
      Engine® 2 and 3 families of ICs. These uniquely architected, highly 
      innovative product families provide the highest access rate solutions 
      available for next generation networking equipment. Additionally, the 
      companies plan to leverage the partnership and respective technologies 
      to enable expanded roadmaps of dual-sourced high-performance memory and 
      intelligent offload products. The leading-edge technologies available 
      from MoSys and GSI enable higher capacity and performance, ensuring that 
      next-generation systems can meet growing user expectations for an ever 
      faster and more intelligent network.
    


      This partnership provides customers with two sources of supply and a 
      path to an expanded roadmap of high-performance parallel and serial 
      memory products, as well as packet processor offload products, from two 
      technology leaders.
    

      “With strong memory expertise, backed by a deep understanding of end 
      customer application requirements, and a commitment to technology 
      leadership and innovation, GSI makes an excellent partner to support our 
      Bandwidth Engine products and roadmap. We are excited to extend our 
      portfolio with the performance-leading SigmaQuad products,” stated Len 
      Perham, CEO for MoSys. “We believe that establishing a platform that 
      allows for alternative sourcing of our respective high-performance 
      solutions, complemented by an aggressive product roadmap leading to even 
      more innovative and architecturally advanced solutions, will prove 
      highly valuable to the market as well as to our mutual customers. We 
      look forward to an ongoing, mutually-beneficial and cooperative 
      relationship with GSI.”
    

      “MoSys has taken a leadership position in developing highly efficient 
      serial interface technology for use with its high-performance Bandwidth 
      Engine solutions, and we are excited to add these innovative products to 
      our memory product portfolio,” stated Lee-Lean 
      Shu, president and CEO for GSI Technology. “The combination of 
      technology innovation, expertise and proven execution of both GSI and 
      MoSys creates an excellent platform for providing the capacity and 
      performance required in our customers’ current generation of networking 
      equipment, and establishes exciting leading-edge roadmap opportunities 
      for next generation systems.”
    

      GSI’s SigmaQuad IVe family of high-performance synchronous SRAM 
      products, which includes both separate I/O quad data rate and common I/O 
      double data rate devices, offers a variety of performance and feature 
      options tailored to high-performance networking and telecom 
      applications. In particular, the combination of sub-1ns random cycle 
      time, sub-6ns read latency, and high transaction rate capability 
      available in the IVe quad data rate devices provides a level of 
      performance that is essential for read-modify-write applications, such 
      as counters and statistics, in today’s 100G and 400G networking systems.
    

      MoSys’ Bandwidth Engine ICs are designed to minimize interface pin count 
      and maximize access and effective transaction rate for buffering, 
      look-up and statistics operations in high-speed systems. The design 
      includes a highly efficient serial data interface and protocol combined 
      with large, integrated high-performance memory and offload macro 
      functions for statistics, metering and atomic operations. The 
      architecture maximizes transactions per second both internally and 
      externally to increase packet processing performance while expanding 
      system features. The Bandwidth Engine devices are designed, built and 
      qualified for high-reliability, carrier-grade applications.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.14      Net Money Flow ($)  17,592    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
