About Roger + Chris (The Humans)
Pictured above, but backwards.
Roger Hazard, a native Texan, grew up amongst Houston's oil money and colorful socialites. After attending Texas A&M University and its Corps of Cadets, he started a design and renovation business. The growth of his business led him to New York City, where he provided design services to — among others — heiresses, entertainers, and retired supermodels. (Not Naomi Campbell.)
A television producer learned about Roger's bold style, fast pace, and imposing physical presence, and proceeded to build a show around him. Soon after, "Sell This House" premiered on A&E featuring Roger. It was the first real estate-related show on U.S. television, the only staging show to be nominated for an Emmy, and continued for nine seasons and 200 episodes. Roger also starred in "Move This House" and "Sell This House: Extreme." He has been featured in newspapers and magazines including Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY, TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, and InStyle. His work on television is viewed around the globe, and he has made television appearances on CBS, ABC, and NBC.
After living in NYC, LA, Seattle, Atlanta, and abroad — and a decade of non-stop travel for work — Roger decided to return to his native Texas to be closer to his family, good BBQ, and pleasant 110°F days.
Chris Stout-Hazard — a Nebraska transplant raised by a dental professor father and a novelist mother he describes as a "goth version of Martha Stewart" — had been a C-level technology executive in several financial companies and had relocated to Austin to become a partner in a startup business. As a web pioneer, he created technology relied upon by hundreds of thousands of users. As a designer and marketer, he established multiple young companies as national-level brands. As the author of this website, he is the one to blame for all grammatical errors.
Shortly after arriving in Austin, Roger met Chris and all hell broke loose.
They got married in Iowa in August 2011, surrounded by their families. As a newlywed couple, Roger and Chris quickly came to the realization that they wanted to reinvent themselves. Despite the continued success of his television career and the renewal of his new show, Roger decided it was time to pursue more challenging projects and walked away from TV. Chris had grown frustrated with the stodginess of the financial industry and was seeking an outlet for his creative side, so he surrendered his ownership of the financial company to his former partners. Together, they decided to start fresh with Roger + Chris — building something from scratch that showcased their talents and was — well, fun!
Roger and Chris have made homes in Austin, Texas, Sharon Springs, New York, Montclair, New Jersey, and, now, Omaha, Nebraska. They're renovating an old house — as always — and enjoying spending time with their big, furry dog Buck.
I feel like this is too much information. Is this too much information? I promise we're not pretentious fools. We're actually quite likable. At least that's what our moms say.
"That Roger and Chris: they're relatively likable, I suppose."          - Mom(s)

Restyling a Garden House: Paint It Black 



Grey House: Renovating a 160-year old Victorian.

A cute, 160-year old Italianate Victorian had the potential to be a stunning garden house - but only after taming the garden, adding style to the porches, and applying some unexpected new colors.

A shot of the house from when it was abandoned in the 1990s.




When we bought the house, the exterior wasn't in the best of condition. The landscaping lacked structure, the porches were anything but welcoming, and the fussy paint scheme was overly busy and yet still boring.

The garage had been built many years after the house, yet shared the dull colors. The driveway was...not good.


Rather than continue with a multi-color paint scheme, we opted to paint the entire house in Sherwin-Williams Inkwell. Trimwork and corbel details were highlighted not with a different color but with a different, higher sheen.


To make the simple front walk more memorable, we built a wood "boardwalk" that we painted to match the house. Our modernist wood gate lends a more formal garden house feel and helps keep Buck the dog from wandering.


Roger created the feel of an English garden by dramatically cutting back the hedge on one side of the house, and cultivating a matching hedge on the other side.

The transformed home features dramatic color, tailored landscaping, and distinctive touches like planter boxes and bold pink doors.

We built planter boxes and added huge boxwoods to add an English touch to the porch.

The back porch features a charming container garden, perfect for days when we keep the French doors open in the kitchen.


We dyed a white Butterfly Chair cover to match our color theme.


The backyard is a mixture of wilderness and whimsy, with Roger's polka dot painted Eames chair sitting amidst wildflowers.


Photo by Alec Hemer.

The finished modern gate and boardwalk create a more formal entrance. We made drapes for the porch to add a whimsical touch. The fabric is an all-weather, fade proof textile. Chris sewed them to length and added black plastic grommets.

The drapery "rods" were improvised from galvanized pipe fittings, with end caps large enough to prevent the drapes from blowing off. They are tied back to the pillars using eye hooks and black paracord.



The previously pinky-gray garage - with vinyl siding and aluminum garage doors - looks far more sophisticated in its darker hue. A new driveway, stained steps, and wildflower garden surrounding it add polish and charm.

The path along the side to the backyard is lined with flowers.

It may seem strange that a home built in the 1800s and nestled between two snowtastic mountain ranges wouldn't have one, but, as a formal village house, it likely served as a secondary summer home for wealthy folks who would venture up during the balmy season and wisely dash back to the city when things got chilly.

Our ageless pieces will look fresh much longer than you will. (No offense, of course.)
Good design isn't ephemeral.
The trendy. The in-style-one-minute, out-the-next. The destined-to-be-dated. While there are plenty of pieces of furniture that look great today, finding objects that will look great tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and beyond is trickier.
We believe that good design — great design — sticks around. It continues to feel modern and fresh, even as more temporal styles fade.
We've searched through hundreds of years' worth of styles to hand-pick designs from the past and present we believe to be timeless and enduring.
Style without sacrifice.
The unpleasant secret of many distinctive furniture styles — whether traditional, modern, or somewhere in between — is that many of them just aren't comfortable.
For instance, classic Chesterfield sofas may bring tremendous style and presence into a room, but they also bring aches and pains, thanks to their nearly-vertical backrests. Higgins, our interpretation of the Chesterfield, brings style and support with a subtly angled backrest that avoids uncomfortable pressure points. Higgins is also better, because "Chesterfield" is kind of a lame name better suited for a foul-smelling cologne or a discontinued brand of cigarettes. Right?
Like contestants in a beauty pageant, our furniture pieces are not evaluated on looks alone. We believe that comfort, durability, and practicality are core components to good design, and we think you'll agree.
Not your neighbor's sofa.
Yes, we offer timeless, well-known styles. But that doesn't mean you don't have an opportunity to express your personality. Our furniture can be ordered in dozens of colors and upholstery types. And you can order pieces from our furniture families in varying widths and configurations to fit your space precisely. Our furniture is made on demand, just for you. Which means your neighbor won't have the same sofa. And that's probably good, because you don't like that neighbor all that much. Never trims the weeds on the side of his house. Seriously. It takes, like, ten minutes max.
If all these options scare you, go buy something boring from our competitors you can rely upon our furniture consultants to step you through the entire process, helping you find the perfect combination for your home.

Pours a very dark and attractive mayagony with a 2 finger mocha head that leaves webs of lace.

Smell is toffee, caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla, oats, leather, and coffee grounds.

Taste follows chocolate, toffee, coffee, and caramel with some leather and nutmeg.

Mouthfeel is about medium, moderate life, not dry, and excellent drink ability for 10% ABV.

Overall this is a very good Stout, a touch thinner than I would have wanted but still very well done. Thanks @jzeilinger for this brew. 563 charactersSawDog505, Jul 18, 20174.24/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A - Pitch black pour and very thin dark toffee colored lacing.

S - Dark roasted chocolate with a slight hint of char/smokiness, fudge brownies, a little bit of vanilla and cream.

T - Dark roasted chocolate, toasted fudge, some smokiness, and ends with a lingering chocolate char

M - Thick and full bodied, velvety with a silky finish.  Alcohol warming on the way down is minimal.

O - Very nice Russian Russian Imperial Stout here! 434 charactersjzeilinger, Jun 30, 20174/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Houser, May 17, 20174.77/5  rDev +14.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75DT85, Mar 05, 20174.29/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25buzzy, Nov 07, 20163.95/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured into a tall pint glass: color is black, solid black; head is tan with fine bubbles and presents about 1/2 inch thick, then some nice lacing on the glass sides.

Smell is moderate roast and coffee/espresso, then heavy fruitiness that is wiped away by strong booze with a near raw/white whiskey like note.

Taste is follows a similar pattern from the aroma: quick but strong roast and coffee, then some raisiny fruitiness and a huge contribution from the alcohol/ester which is even more raw and strong than the aroma.  The booziness is a bit strong, and detracts from the underlying malt flavors, but it is still a unique taste.

Mouthfeel is near cloying, but with the malt backbone of this brew its where you might expect, big malt sweetness, some burn from the booziness, and moderate carbonation.

Overall this is no doubt a strong stout, big malt and espresso notes, some lighter chocolate but an impressive dose of ester booziness. A sipper for sure, or maybe one to let age just a bit more. 1,003 charactersmvanaskie13, Oct 15, 20163.7/5  rDev -10.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75barneysdad, Apr 23, 20164.15/5  rDev 0%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Eziel, Apr 19, 20164.09/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4J455K, Apr 08, 20164.15/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Had on-cask (hand pump) at the brewery and in bottle many times.  poured into a goblet.

L:  Pours a midnight black color, opaque, with a good finger and a half of brownish head.   Delicate lacing.

S:   Roasted malts and coffee... cocoa, vanilla and smoke.

T/F:  Big time roasted malt character and hints of smokiness mingle with espresso and cocoa.  Very thick and creamy... and being on cask really makes this smooth.  Dry at the finish... warming, and the flavor really pops out as this warms up a bit.

O:   A big time Imperial Stout from Otto's.... which is great on tap and even better after a bomber has 2 years in the basement.   One of Otto's best brews and a perennial favorite. 690 charactersEMV, Mar 30, 20163.35/5  rDev -19.3%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Oktoberfist, Mar 02, 20163.89/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4ConnorSimpson41, Feb 09, 20164/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Rizzy17, Feb 09, 20164.5/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5sposter4, Jan 10, 20163.88/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4MTKATL, Nov 27, 20154.28/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25GregSemenza, Nov 20, 20154.09/5  rDev -1.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4DucksFan16, Sep 25, 20154.15/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25tdm168, Aug 07, 20154.13/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Mikus, Jul 27, 20154.12/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4maxifunk777, Jun 08, 20154.33/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25RickB78, Apr 05, 20154/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4petewheeler, Mar 05, 20153.59/5  rDev -13.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5mkhartnett, Mar 04, 20153.97/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4bf7, Feb 15, 2015

St. Bernardus WitbierBrouwerij St. Bernardus NVWitbier / 5.50% ABV3.84/5  rDev -7.5% | Avg: 4.15look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Yellow with a brownish tint and plenty hazy.  There's a fingernail of off white covering a quarter of the top.  I smell pale wheat, a restrained amount of coriander and a hint of lemon.  I taste coriander which is quickly kept in line by the delicate pale wheat.  The mouth is delicate, light, and refreshing. 309 charactersFranziskaner, 5 minutes agoDry Irish StoutSwiftwater Brewing CompanyIrish Dry Stout / 5.50% ABV4.09/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.09look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Swiftwater Brewing Company in Rochester, NY.

This one pours a very dark brown, glossy, with a small head and lots of lacing.

This one smells like chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and smoke. It's a classic aroma for this type of beer but it works.

This is surprisingly quite nice- I was apprehensive about it. It's certainly not thick, but it's not as thin as I thought it would be. It's super drinkable, with a heavy roasted character, smooth chocolate, black coffee, and a hint of smoke on the finish. 

This is very creamy, even being on normal CO2- I was super happy it wasn't presented on nitro.

This is definitely a really nice beer- I could drink a few very easily and very quickly. 702 charactersGreesyFizeek, 6 minutes agoWho You Callin' WussieArrogant BrewingGerman Pilsener / 5.80% ABV3.88/5  rDev -1.3% | Avg: 3.93look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pours a hazy pale yellow into a fifteen ounce glass mug the same temperature as the beer.  Small white head that settles to a patchy rime that lasts.  Some lacing.

The nose is mild.  Just right for a good Pilz.  Touch of spiciness along with some floral hops and caramel malt.

Blast of mild fruity hops begins the flavor profile.  Touch of citrus.  Ruby red grapefruit comes to mind.  Caramel balances the hops for a mild drinkable taste with excellent balance.

Crisp, smooth and refreshing makes for a light mouthfeel.  Lots of carbonation but it works well with this brew.

Really good Pilz.  You can drink it all day.  Goes down way too easy.  At 5.8% ABV you have some latitude.  Session beer for sure. 709 charactersRufus1, 6 minutes agoPeak Organic Super FreshPeak Organic Brewing CompanyAmerican Double / Imperial Pilsner / 7.60% ABV4.06/5  rDev -2.6% | Avg: 4.17look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a very hazy golden which is a negative in a pilsner to me, but this is "a wicked dry hopped pilsner" so I guess I'll allow it. You can smell the mosaic on the nose. It's very prominent. Some berry character up front with a birch bark minty finish. It's well done, but I'm not crazy about the flavor profile. 313 charactersSheppard, 8 minutes agoPaycheck's PorterFifty West Brewing CoAmerican Porter / 6.10% ABV4.41/5  rDev +6% | Avg: 4.16look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This porter is great.  Pours a deep black with a tan head that disappears quickly.  Taste and feel are incredibly smooth.  This is an underappreciated beer from 50 West that puts out a lot of great brews.  As far as porters go, this and Edmund are my tops. 256 charactersKevin6234, 8 minutes agoPantry PartyFox Farm BrewerySaison / Farmhouse Ale / 5.40% ABV4.1/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.1look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Fox Farm. Pours a dark orange color with no head. Zero lacing. Tart aroma. Sour grapes and maybe cranberries? The taste is a nice tart blend. Lemon, lime, and white wine. Very refreshing with little carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Great collaboration. 264 charactersPicoPapa, 9 minutes agoVers L'avantWolverine State Brewing CompanyAmerican Pale Lager / 5.50% ABV3.59/5  rDev -4.5% | Avg: 3.76look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I picked up a bottle of Wolverine State Brewing's Vers L'avant for $3.09 at The Lager Mill.  This one peaked my interest and I'm interested to see what they can do with this kind of beer, so lets see how it goes.  2017 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz golden foiled bottle into a teku.  

A-  The label looks nice, it's got a nice design to it that goes well with the beer and it's a little eye catching.  It poured a cloudy darker orange color that took on more of amber orange color when held to the light and it had almost three fingers worth of fluffy and creamy off white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of patchy lacing behind.  This is a good looking beer, I have no complaints.

S-  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with a pear juice aroma being the first to show up and it has a fermented like aroma to it.  Up next comes a little bit of a soapy aroma that leads into a little bit of a funky aroma.  Towards the end comes the malts which impart some grainy, pale malt, bready and sweet malt like aromas.  This beer has a pretty nice aroma, but I wish the pear aspect was cleaner.  

T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with higher amount of medium sweetness with the pear juice still being the first to show up and it impart a sharp fermented pear juice flavor that goes right into a herbal and lightly grassy flavor followed by a little funkiness.  Up next comes the malts which impart all the aspects that they did in the aroma and they are just a little lighter this time.  On the finish there's a lighter amount of medium medicinal like bitterness with a fermented pear juice like aftertaste.  This is nice tasting beer, but I still wish the pear aspect was cleaner.  

M-  A little smooth, slightly cloying, a little sticky, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is nice, but I wish it was a little smoother.  

Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a solid example of the style, it didn't blow me away or anything, but it was pretty much just as advertised, i just didn't think it would be as funky and fermented as it was.  This beer had ok drinkability, one is enough for me, anymore than that and it would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer is the appearance, it's a good looking beer.  What I like the least about this beer is that the pear aspects weren't cleaner and it could use a little less bitterness.  I don't think I would buy this beer again and I can't say it's a must try, but if your don't mind some fermented pear flavors than it's worth checking out.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I liked the direction it was going in and with some cleaning up I could see this being a good beer.  It's not a favorite Wolverine State beer and it's a solid example of the style.  Solid job guys, but this one has the potential to be better. 2,979 charactersStoutHunter, 11 minutes agoTen FIDY Bourbon Barrel AgedOskar Blues Grill & BrewRussian Imperial Stout / 12.90% ABV4.64/5  rDev +3.3% | Avg: 4.49look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Tap at whym in Portsmouth

Big creamy dark thick rich head retains forever, pitch black beer

Nose loads of bourbon, dark choc, biscuity cocoa, little roast, char, super dark chocolate, lush nougat, loads of vanilla and oak barrel, fudgey

Taste brings loads of bourbon, barrel juice, loads of vanilla barrel, dark chocolate cocoa, biscuity cookie dough and nougat, little roasty char, chewy nougat and caramel fudgey bitter earthy hop and roast on the back end, mixed with vanilla barrel bourbon juice

Mouth is thick fudgey chewy, fluffy carb, very little booze

Overall as good, no better, than I would have expected, great base beer, so much bourbon barrel juice 666 charactersjlindros, 11 minutes agoBlackberry DuplicitousBaere Brewing CompanyAmerican Wild Ale / 6.60% ABV4.36/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.36look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5this is batch 3 of this from what i understand, and apparently the abv and the nuances have fluctuated quite a lot from one to the next, but this is super dialed in, and if they brew it again, i wouldnt change a thing. its a wild ale aged in wine barrels with blackberries. gorgeous artwork on the bottles like all of the baere stuff, whoever whips those up is doing an awesome job! the beer is killer too, heavy red wine notes to it, lots of dried cherries and berries, and a strong wood and wine tannic presence along with the lactic sourness. its somehow not that intense, like its not sharp or striking, everything is in balance, and despite enormous complexity, it doesnt feel overdone. the blackberry is fresh and forward, sweet for a second, but absorbed into the heavy red wine complexion rather easily. some funk here, tons of wet wood, and the sourness, which has a citric element, and is about as much as i want of it. it has a berliner cleanness to it, a freshness too with the fruit, but also a wonderful maturity, complex on the yeast side, and dry in the finish with the wood closing it out. notes of cocoa in the malt, tobacco even, but its not dark or heavy on my tongue, despite only average carbonation. this is expert wild beer, a perfect fusion of fruit and barrel, and something to be celebrated. still somehow these guys arent getting the attention i think they deserve for these beers. i would like to try other editions of this one and really take in some of the differences between them, but this one is special! i sure it will age wonderfully too, as the blackberry fades into the wine. gorgeous specimen! 1,632 charactersStonedTrippin, 17 minutes agoDaylilyFox Farm BreweryAmerican Double / Imperial IPA / 8.10% ABV4.21/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.21look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy orangey yellow with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Pineapple, mango, guava, and lime. Dank hop notes as well. The taste is a blend of tropical and citrus fruits as well as the dank hops. Guava, pineapple finish with more dank. Moderate alcohol presence. Medium bodied. Reminds me a tiny bit of Jai Alai. Worth having again. 398 charactersPicoPapa, 24 minutes agoChillax WheatBootstrap BrewingAmerican Pale Wheat Ale3.79/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.79look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75a pineapple wheat beer these guys have concocted for summer, and as pineapple flavored beer goes, its well ahead of the curve. the cool part about this pale hazy and incredibly frothy brew is that its not at all sweet desite how much authentic pineapple flavor is in here. its very natural, but its dry in the end, or at least drier than any other pineapple flavored beer i have ever had that wasnt a sour. aroma of fresh and canned pineapple at the same time, orange juice from concentrate, and white wheat. its simple, so the pineapple comes through nicely. the flavor is like that too, with some juiced pineapple element to it, really almost concentrated, intense for a flash, but mellow by the end, still a beer first, it rises and falls appropriately, and just screams summertime at me. i was nervous to order this one, expecting it to be fake and sugary, but its mighty authentic, and fermented down just the right amount. bootstrap continues to stay out of the spotlight despite some quality beers and a good amount of innovation. this is essential summer drinking, easy down, and best when ice cold. id almost advocate for a frosted mug with this one... 1,161 charactersStonedTrippin, 25 minutes agoDeluxeburyIndependent Fermentations Brewing (IndieFerm)American Pale Ale (APA)3.54/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.54look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5Growler poured into teku glass -given me to by generous neighbor

Named for the nearby affluent town of Duxbury

Pencil thin white foam cap, quickly settles to a white ring, some lacings 

Translucent amber, a few streams of carbonation 

Wine, sour aroma

more of a grain taste, malt, rye?

medium sudsing , tart, crisp

Good beer 331 charactersWunderLlama, 26 minutes agoIntergalaxyc T.R.I.P.Aeronaut Brewing CompanyAmerican IPA / 7.50% ABV4.36/5  rDev +12.1% | Avg: 3.89look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Canned 8 days ago.

L -- Somewhat turbid orange body with a one-finger white head produced with aerated pour. Some retention and lacing
S -- Although mild, the aromas that are present are very pleasant: pineapple, mango, papaya, and a little yeasty funkiness in the back
T -- Pineapple, candied grapefruit, orange flesh, spicy yeastiness, biscuit malts, melon, and a hint of grassy earthiness
F -- Very low bitterness. Semi-dry with an astringent finish. Medium carb, medium- mouthfeel. Quite refreshing on a hot day
O -- Based on prior reviews (and my own experience with Galaxy-hopped beers), freshness is very important in this brew. When fresh, tastes like a slightly less pungent version of Trillium's Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point. A little confused by the 'Imperial Session Ale' marketing tag..... so you mean an American Pale Ale??

88/100 846 charactersHolderness, 30 minutes agoBirra PeroniBirra Peroni Industriale S.p.A.Euro Pale Lager / 4.70% ABV2.99/5  rDev +12% | Avg: 2.67look: 2.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Wow I haven't reviewed this?  Crazy.  I think I first had this beer on Brady Street in Milwaukee about 15 years ago.   Pours that feint straw yellow you tend to not dig on.  Ok, so I'm getting a proverbial diet lager almost.  Whatevs, we can still make this work.  Did I mention a super thin 1/8" white head that disappears quickly?  Aroma of grain.   Didn't they used to make these in green bottles?  I want my Euro skunk lager smell dammit!  

Taste is almost nil, mouth feel is a grain and grass dryness.  Almost no hopping, high carbonation, light body.   There isn't much more to say about it.  Bland?  If you like that word I guess.  I prefer to think of it as a beer you can just pound without getting into tasting notes too much. 737 charactersrodbeermunch, 32 minutes agoBadger Club AmberWisconsin Brewing Co.American Amber / Red Ale / 5.50% ABV4.41/5  rDev +17% | Avg: 3.77look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a clear darker amber, almost coppery color with off-white head. Cereal grains, caramel, bread, a light grass note, and some fruit on the nose; follows onto the palate. Medium bodied. Finishes with caramel and bread. 221 charactersTX-Badger, 32 minutes ago#9Magic Hat Brewing CompanyFruit / Vegetable Beer / 5.10% ABV3.57/5  rDev +5% | Avg: 3.4look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a hazy gold into a fifteen ounce glass mug the same temperature as the beer.  Two finger white head that dissipates rapidly to a thin rime.  Really pretty lacing.

Mild fruit with hints of apricot and apple.

Tastes bright and clean.  No funk at all. Fruit is definitely not the predominant flavor.  Thought it would be more fruity.  Reminds me of a weak lager except for the lack of hop bite.

Light and refreshing on the palate.  Good carbonation.  Faint sweet finish.

Overall a nice beer.  Very drinkable.  Mild is the best word I can think of to describe it. 569 charactersRufus1, 34 minutes agoHighBeam IPAWalnut River Brewing CompanyAmerican IPA / 7.70% ABV4.06/5  rDev +6.6% | Avg: 3.81look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a clear yellow golden color with white head.

I'm always down to give a new citrus IPA a try, so lets see how it goes.  2017 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into an IPA glass.  

A-  The label looks nice, it goes well with the name and it's a little eye catching.  It poured a nice orange color that takes on a little more of a darker orange color when held to the light and it has almost two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind.  This is a pretty nice looking beer, but I wish it had just a little better lacing.

S-  The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the fruits being the first to show up and it imparts nice blends of fruity aromas that gives it a fruit punk like aroma with some nice citrus and tropical fruit aromas coming through and it's followed by a little more sweetness.   Up next comes a little bit of doughy yeast and it's followed by a light hop aroma with not much malty aromas coming through.  This beer has a good aroma, I like the fruit punch aspects, but I wish the hops and malts showed up a little more.  

T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma, but it's a little more balance and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness with the fruits still being the first to show up and they impart those fruit punch like aspects that they did in the aroma and it's really juicy.  Up next comes some more sweetness with the hops showing up next and they impart a generic hoppy flavor with a little bit of citrus hop and green hops.  On the finish there's a medium amount of bitterness with a little more sweetness and it had a very fruity aftertaste.  This is a pretty nice tasting beer, but it would be really good if it was a little more balanced.  

M-  Smooth, a little cloying, refreshing, crisp, medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is pretty nice and it works well with this beer.  

Overall I thought it was a nice beer, but it wasn't that greatest example of the style, when it came down to it the taste was a little more like a shandy than an IPA.  this beer has nice drinkability, I could drink a couple of them without getting bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer is the fruity flavors, they were nice and juicy.  What I like the least about this beer is the balance, I wish more malts and hops came through to balance out the fruits and make it feel not so shandy like.  I would buy this beer again when looking for a fruity beer and I would recommend it to anyone else looking for the same.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't really like it as an IPA since it  just felt like it was more of a fruit beer in almost every aspect.  It's not my favorite beer from this brewery and it's not the greatest example of the style.  You guys made a tasty beer, but I just not sure it's tasty IPA. 2,974 charactersStoutHunter, 38 minutes agoSaison Des DunesMicrobrasserie St-PancraceSaison / Farmhouse Ale / 6.30% ABV3.27/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.27look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25Deep cloudy, almost opaque, golden color with dense activity. Extra foamy and frothy light beige 4-5 finger head in a large tulip, lasting around 15 minutes, with moderate legs and lace, but a good swirl response. Flavors of sweet grains, lemon, grapefruits, orange peels, wild and brett yeast, peppercorn, caramel, with floral hops. Strong strength finish, quite dry and boozy, a bit peppery with dominant sour fruits that is more citrusy than tropical, including a thick malty leathery feel. Ends leafy and tongue coating, not crisp enough nor zesty. Too alcoholic, feels like 9%, so it lacks complexity. Hits the accessibility too, and not quite as fresh as it should. Slightly off and not like a usual Saison, more like a barley Pale Ale cross Tripel spiciness. Some bardyard feel is present, yet quickly overwhelmed by the malts. Highly warming stuff though. With some tweaks it could be interesting, until then, overall this is an okay quality craft. 956 charactersTheBierdimpfe, 39 minutes agoCake By The OceanBeara Irish Brewing Co.American Porter / 6.00% ABV3.82/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.81look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75Tap at the brewery

Uhhhhmmmm okay.

A - Poured a dark brown almost black hue whey no real head that leaves a thin halo.

S - Aromas of roast malts, chocolate, light coffee, light sweetness.

T - Taste is similar to the nose. Sweet malts, roasted malts, bakers chocolate, little bit of coffee. There is a rather interesting cookie quality going on that is different. Finish is a bit bitter.

M - Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, comes across a really thin.

O - Overall this is a solid porter. The coffee is nice along with the chocolate. There is an interesting almost out of place hoppy bitter finish that I'm not a huge fan of.

BEER INFO

Brewed by:

Drake's Brewing Co.
California, United Statesdrinkdrakes.com 
Style: American Double / Imperial Stout

Alcohol by volume (ABV): 9.00%
		
Availability: Winter
		
Notes / Commercial Description:

		After years of amassing booty on the high seas, Drake’s Jolly Rodger naturally acquired a taste for the finer coffees brought to life by artisan, specialty roasters. That’s why this year, Jolly teamed up with Blue Bottle Coffee’s meticulous roasters in Oakland for his latest incarnation, Jolly Rodger 2014 Coffee Imperial Stout. Rich and complex, this beer features luscious chocolaty and subtle roasted malt flavors that blend expertly with a specially made roast of Kenyan Kangunu coffee to create aromas of caramelized stone fruit and flavors of black currant, tobacco, and caramel.

O: Solid; the beer has mellowed considerably and no longer is boozy or sharp, but at the same time the coffee character has fallen off and now drinks like a slightly sweet, though smooth stout. 605 charactersPhil-Fresh, May 28, 20173.58/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Can_has_beer, Aug 13, 20164.1/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4xtonytx, Jul 04, 20163.75/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Nichols33, Apr 11, 20164.13/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25KensWorld, Mar 05, 20164.5/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5MrTcell, Feb 06, 20164/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4jschott75, Jan 30, 20163.98/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4smi69, Jan 14, 20164/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Jae61, Jan 10, 20164.29/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25mmcurran, Dec 27, 20153.93/5  rDev -4.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4kmoen, Dec 15, 20154.07/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4BAsbill, Dec 15, 20154.4/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25cducap, Nov 18, 20153.89/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75It's not in the same league as Peche Mortel, but then again, what is...?

St. Bernardus WitbierBrouwerij St. Bernardus NVWitbier / 5.50% ABV3.84/5  rDev -7.5% | Avg: 4.15look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Yellow with a brownish tint and plenty hazy.  There's a fingernail of off white covering a quarter of the top.  I smell pale wheat, a restrained amount of coriander and a hint of lemon.  I taste coriander which is quickly kept in line by the delicate pale wheat.  The mouth is delicate, light, and refreshing. 309 charactersFranziskaner, 5 minutes agoDry Irish StoutSwiftwater Brewing CompanyIrish Dry Stout / 5.50% ABV4.09/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.09look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Swiftwater Brewing Company in Rochester, NY.

This one pours a very dark brown, glossy, with a small head and lots of lacing.

This one smells like chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and smoke. It's a classic aroma for this type of beer but it works.

This is surprisingly quite nice- I was apprehensive about it. It's certainly not thick, but it's not as thin as I thought it would be. It's super drinkable, with a heavy roasted character, smooth chocolate, black coffee, and a hint of smoke on the finish. 

This is very creamy, even being on normal CO2- I was super happy it wasn't presented on nitro.

This is definitely a really nice beer- I could drink a few very easily and very quickly. 702 charactersGreesyFizeek, 6 minutes agoWho You Callin' WussieArrogant BrewingGerman Pilsener / 5.80% ABV3.88/5  rDev -1.3% | Avg: 3.93look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pours a hazy pale yellow into a fifteen ounce glass mug the same temperature as the beer.  Small white head that settles to a patchy rime that lasts.  Some lacing.

The nose is mild.  Just right for a good Pilz.  Touch of spiciness along with some floral hops and caramel malt.

Blast of mild fruity hops begins the flavor profile.  Touch of citrus.  Ruby red grapefruit comes to mind.  Caramel balances the hops for a mild drinkable taste with excellent balance.

Crisp, smooth and refreshing makes for a light mouthfeel.  Lots of carbonation but it works well with this brew.

Really good Pilz.  You can drink it all day.  Goes down way too easy.  At 5.8% ABV you have some latitude.  Session beer for sure. 709 charactersRufus1, 6 minutes agoPeak Organic Super FreshPeak Organic Brewing CompanyAmerican Double / Imperial Pilsner / 7.60% ABV4.06/5  rDev -2.6% | Avg: 4.17look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a very hazy golden which is a negative in a pilsner to me, but this is "a wicked dry hopped pilsner" so I guess I'll allow it. You can smell the mosaic on the nose. It's very prominent. Some berry character up front with a birch bark minty finish. It's well done, but I'm not crazy about the flavor profile. 313 charactersSheppard, 8 minutes agoPaycheck's PorterFifty West Brewing CoAmerican Porter / 6.10% ABV4.41/5  rDev +6% | Avg: 4.16look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This porter is great.  Pours a deep black with a tan head that disappears quickly.  Taste and feel are incredibly smooth.  This is an underappreciated beer from 50 West that puts out a lot of great brews.  As far as porters go, this and Edmund are my tops. 256 charactersKevin6234, 8 minutes agoPantry PartyFox Farm BrewerySaison / Farmhouse Ale / 5.40% ABV4.1/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.1look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Fox Farm. Pours a dark orange color with no head. Zero lacing. Tart aroma. Sour grapes and maybe cranberries? The taste is a nice tart blend. Lemon, lime, and white wine. Very refreshing with little carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Great collaboration. 264 charactersPicoPapa, 9 minutes agoVers L'avantWolverine State Brewing CompanyAmerican Pale Lager / 5.50% ABV3.59/5  rDev -4.5% | Avg: 3.76look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I picked up a bottle of Wolverine State Brewing's Vers L'avant for $3.09 at The Lager Mill.  This one peaked my interest and I'm interested to see what they can do with this kind of beer, so lets see how it goes.  2017 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz golden foiled bottle into a teku.  

A-  The label looks nice, it's got a nice design to it that goes well with the beer and it's a little eye catching.  It poured a cloudy darker orange color that took on more of amber orange color when held to the light and it had almost three fingers worth of fluffy and creamy off white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of patchy lacing behind.  This is a good looking beer, I have no complaints.

S-  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with a pear juice aroma being the first to show up and it has a fermented like aroma to it.  Up next comes a little bit of a soapy aroma that leads into a little bit of a funky aroma.  Towards the end comes the malts which impart some grainy, pale malt, bready and sweet malt like aromas.  This beer has a pretty nice aroma, but I wish the pear aspect was cleaner.  

T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with higher amount of medium sweetness with the pear juice still being the first to show up and it impart a sharp fermented pear juice flavor that goes right into a herbal and lightly grassy flavor followed by a little funkiness.  Up next comes the malts which impart all the aspects that they did in the aroma and they are just a little lighter this time.  On the finish there's a lighter amount of medium medicinal like bitterness with a fermented pear juice like aftertaste.  This is nice tasting beer, but I still wish the pear aspect was cleaner.  

M-  A little smooth, slightly cloying, a little sticky, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is nice, but I wish it was a little smoother.  

Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a solid example of the style, it didn't blow me away or anything, but it was pretty much just as advertised, i just didn't think it would be as funky and fermented as it was.  This beer had ok drinkability, one is enough for me, anymore than that and it would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer is the appearance, it's a good looking beer.  What I like the least about this beer is that the pear aspects weren't cleaner and it could use a little less bitterness.  I don't think I would buy this beer again and I can't say it's a must try, but if your don't mind some fermented pear flavors than it's worth checking out.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I liked the direction it was going in and with some cleaning up I could see this being a good beer.  It's not a favorite Wolverine State beer and it's a solid example of the style.  Solid job guys, but this one has the potential to be better. 2,979 charactersStoutHunter, 11 minutes agoTen FIDY Bourbon Barrel AgedOskar Blues Grill & BrewRussian Imperial Stout / 12.90% ABV4.64/5  rDev +3.3% | Avg: 4.49look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Tap at whym in Portsmouth

Big creamy dark thick rich head retains forever, pitch black beer

Nose loads of bourbon, dark choc, biscuity cocoa, little roast, char, super dark chocolate, lush nougat, loads of vanilla and oak barrel, fudgey

Taste brings loads of bourbon, barrel juice, loads of vanilla barrel, dark chocolate cocoa, biscuity cookie dough and nougat, little roasty char, chewy nougat and caramel fudgey bitter earthy hop and roast on the back end, mixed with vanilla barrel bourbon juice

Mouth is thick fudgey chewy, fluffy carb, very little booze

Overall as good, no better, than I would have expected, great base beer, so much bourbon barrel juice 666 charactersjlindros, 11 minutes agoBlackberry DuplicitousBaere Brewing CompanyAmerican Wild Ale / 6.60% ABV4.36/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.36look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5this is batch 3 of this from what i understand, and apparently the abv and the nuances have fluctuated quite a lot from one to the next, but this is super dialed in, and if they brew it again, i wouldnt change a thing. its a wild ale aged in wine barrels with blackberries. gorgeous artwork on the bottles like all of the baere stuff, whoever whips those up is doing an awesome job! the beer is killer too, heavy red wine notes to it, lots of dried cherries and berries, and a strong wood and wine tannic presence along with the lactic sourness. its somehow not that intense, like its not sharp or striking, everything is in balance, and despite enormous complexity, it doesnt feel overdone. the blackberry is fresh and forward, sweet for a second, but absorbed into the heavy red wine complexion rather easily. some funk here, tons of wet wood, and the sourness, which has a citric element, and is about as much as i want of it. it has a berliner cleanness to it, a freshness too with the fruit, but also a wonderful maturity, complex on the yeast side, and dry in the finish with the wood closing it out. notes of cocoa in the malt, tobacco even, but its not dark or heavy on my tongue, despite only average carbonation. this is expert wild beer, a perfect fusion of fruit and barrel, and something to be celebrated. still somehow these guys arent getting the attention i think they deserve for these beers. i would like to try other editions of this one and really take in some of the differences between them, but this one is special! i sure it will age wonderfully too, as the blackberry fades into the wine. gorgeous specimen! 1,632 charactersStonedTrippin, 17 minutes agoDaylilyFox Farm BreweryAmerican Double / Imperial IPA / 8.10% ABV4.21/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 4.21look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy orangey yellow with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Pineapple, mango, guava, and lime. Dank hop notes as well. The taste is a blend of tropical and citrus fruits as well as the dank hops. Guava, pineapple finish with more dank. Moderate alcohol presence. Medium bodied. Reminds me a tiny bit of Jai Alai. Worth having again. 398 charactersPicoPapa, 24 minutes agoChillax WheatBootstrap BrewingAmerican Pale Wheat Ale3.79/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.79look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75a pineapple wheat beer these guys have concocted for summer, and as pineapple flavored beer goes, its well ahead of the curve. the cool part about this pale hazy and incredibly frothy brew is that its not at all sweet desite how much authentic pineapple flavor is in here. its very natural, but its dry in the end, or at least drier than any other pineapple flavored beer i have ever had that wasnt a sour. aroma of fresh and canned pineapple at the same time, orange juice from concentrate, and white wheat. its simple, so the pineapple comes through nicely. the flavor is like that too, with some juiced pineapple element to it, really almost concentrated, intense for a flash, but mellow by the end, still a beer first, it rises and falls appropriately, and just screams summertime at me. i was nervous to order this one, expecting it to be fake and sugary, but its mighty authentic, and fermented down just the right amount. bootstrap continues to stay out of the spotlight despite some quality beers and a good amount of innovation. this is essential summer drinking, easy down, and best when ice cold. id almost advocate for a frosted mug with this one... 1,161 charactersStonedTrippin, 25 minutes agoDeluxeburyIndependent Fermentations Brewing (IndieFerm)American Pale Ale (APA)3.54/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.54look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5Growler poured into teku glass -given me to by generous neighbor

L -- Somewhat turbid orange body with a one-finger white head produced with aerated pour. Some retention and lacing
S -- Although mild, the aromas that are present are very pleasant: pineapple, mango, papaya, and a little yeasty funkiness in the back
T -- Pineapple, candied grapefruit, orange flesh, spicy yeastiness, biscuit malts, melon, and a hint of grassy earthiness
F -- Very low bitterness. Semi-dry with an astringent finish. Medium carb, medium- mouthfeel. Quite refreshing on a hot day
O -- Based on prior reviews (and my own experience with Galaxy-hopped beers), freshness is very important in this brew. When fresh, tastes like a slightly less pungent version of Trillium's Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point. A little confused by the 'Imperial Session Ale' marketing tag..... so you mean an American Pale Ale??

Crazy.  I think I first had this beer on Brady Street in Milwaukee about 15 years ago.   Pours that feint straw yellow you tend to not dig on.  Ok, so I'm getting a proverbial diet lager almost.  Whatevs, we can still make this work.  Did I mention a super thin 1/8" white head that disappears quickly?  Aroma of grain.   Didn't they used to make these in green bottles?  I want my Euro skunk lager smell dammit!  

Taste is almost nil, mouth feel is a grain and grass dryness.  Almost no hopping, high carbonation, light body.   There isn't much more to say about it.  Bland?  If you like that word I guess.  I prefer to think of it as a beer you can just pound without getting into tasting notes too much. 737 charactersrodbeermunch, 32 minutes agoBadger Club AmberWisconsin Brewing Co.American Amber / Red Ale / 5.50% ABV4.41/5  rDev +17% | Avg: 3.77look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a clear darker amber, almost coppery color with off-white head.

Two finger white head that dissipates rapidly to a thin rime.  Really pretty lacing.

Mild fruit with hints of apricot and apple.

Tastes bright and clean.  No funk at all. Fruit is definitely not the predominant flavor.  Thought it would be more fruity.  Reminds me of a weak lager except for the lack of hop bite.

Light and refreshing on the palate.  Good carbonation.  Faint sweet finish.

Overall a nice beer.  Very drinkable.  Mild is the best word I can think of to describe it. 569 charactersRufus1, 34 minutes agoHighBeam IPAWalnut River Brewing CompanyAmerican IPA / 7.70% ABV4.06/5  rDev +6.6% | Avg: 3.81look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a clear yellow golden color with white head.

I'm always down to give a new citrus IPA a try, so lets see how it goes.  2017 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into an IPA glass.  

A-  The label looks nice, it goes well with the name and it's a little eye catching.  It poured a nice orange color that takes on a little more of a darker orange color when held to the light and it has almost two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind.  This is a pretty nice looking beer, but I wish it had just a little better lacing.

S-  The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the fruits being the first to show up and it imparts nice blends of fruity aromas that gives it a fruit punk like aroma with some nice citrus and tropical fruit aromas coming through and it's followed by a little more sweetness.   Up next comes a little bit of doughy yeast and it's followed by a light hop aroma with not much malty aromas coming through.  This beer has a good aroma, I like the fruit punch aspects, but I wish the hops and malts showed up a little more.  

T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma, but it's a little more balance and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness with the fruits still being the first to show up and they impart those fruit punch like aspects that they did in the aroma and it's really juicy.  Up next comes some more sweetness with the hops showing up next and they impart a generic hoppy flavor with a little bit of citrus hop and green hops.  On the finish there's a medium amount of bitterness with a little more sweetness and it had a very fruity aftertaste.  This is a pretty nice tasting beer, but it would be really good if it was a little more balanced.  

M-  Smooth, a little cloying, refreshing, crisp, medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is pretty nice and it works well with this beer.  

Overall I thought it was a nice beer, but it wasn't that greatest example of the style, when it came down to it the taste was a little more like a shandy than an IPA.  this beer has nice drinkability, I could drink a couple of them without getting bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer is the fruity flavors, they were nice and juicy.  What I like the least about this beer is the balance, I wish more malts and hops came through to balance out the fruits and make it feel not so shandy like.  I would buy this beer again when looking for a fruity beer and I would recommend it to anyone else looking for the same.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't really like it as an IPA since it  just felt like it was more of a fruit beer in almost every aspect.  It's not my favorite beer from this brewery and it's not the greatest example of the style.  You guys made a tasty beer, but I just not sure it's tasty IPA. 2,974 charactersStoutHunter, 38 minutes agoSaison Des DunesMicrobrasserie St-PancraceSaison / Farmhouse Ale / 6.30% ABV3.27/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.27look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25Deep cloudy, almost opaque, golden color with dense activity. Extra foamy and frothy light beige 4-5 finger head in a large tulip, lasting around 15 minutes, with moderate legs and lace, but a good swirl response. Flavors of sweet grains, lemon, grapefruits, orange peels, wild and brett yeast, peppercorn, caramel, with floral hops. Strong strength finish, quite dry and boozy, a bit peppery with dominant sour fruits that is more citrusy than tropical, including a thick malty leathery feel. Ends leafy and tongue coating, not crisp enough nor zesty. Too alcoholic, feels like 9%, so it lacks complexity. Hits the accessibility too, and not quite as fresh as it should. Slightly off and not like a usual Saison, more like a barley Pale Ale cross Tripel spiciness. Some bardyard feel is present, yet quickly overwhelmed by the malts. Highly warming stuff though. With some tweaks it could be interesting, until then, overall this is an okay quality craft. 956 charactersTheBierdimpfe, 39 minutes agoCake By The OceanBeara Irish Brewing Co.American Porter / 6.00% ABV3.82/5  rDev 0% | Avg: 3.81look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75Tap at the brewery

Uhhhhmmmm okay.

A - Poured a dark brown almost black hue whey no real head that leaves a thin halo.

S - Aromas of roast malts, chocolate, light coffee, light sweetness.

T - Taste is similar to the nose. Sweet malts, roasted malts, bakers chocolate, little bit of coffee. There is a rather interesting cookie quality going on that is different. Finish is a bit bitter.

M - Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, comes across a really thin.

O - Overall this is a solid porter. The coffee is nice along with the chocolate. There is an interesting almost out of place hoppy bitter finish that I'm not a huge fan of.

Get to Know Booming Home Furnishing Brand Roger + Chris

With the summer in full swing, many Manhattanites and creative people beyond are looking to upgrade their space to make it look fresh and new when guests show up to their house.  Whether it is a place to crash for a couple of days, a great party celebrating someone’s birthday or your brand new renovated dining room to enjoy with your family, the home furnishing business is really in full swing.  One business that is on the up and up and making quite the name for themselves in a very short time, is Roger + Chris, who are based right outside Manhattan in Sharon Springs, New York. 
Credit: Chris Stout-Hazard
Roger + Chris, otherwise known as Chris Stout-Hazard and Roger Hazard, have a mission to as they say it, “unboring your home”.  Roger has had quite the history being in front of the camera (how can you blame the audience for not wanting to see him? Giggity) for huge shows such as “Sell This House” and “Move This House”.  Chris on the other hand, came from the world of c-level technology, who developed himself as a major web pioneer and someone who, thanks to his design and marketing, helped start-up companies become national brands in a short period of time.  Then they met, and decided to shift everything they were doing to make Roger+ Chris.
Roger + Chris offers a variety of distinctive products for the everyday home, all made in the USA.  Whether it is lighting, furniture, pillows or on the go, they pretty much have you covered to make sure the idea you have for your house comes to fruition.  They also have a great web series that they do called “Roger That”, available on their website, where they transform homes with bright colors, patterns and more to give it a modern feel about itself.  Essentially, from my point of view, they are the new dynamic duo of the home furnishing world, and in a short five years have taken a simple idea and have turned it into something so much bigger than that.
I recently spoke to one half of the team, Chris Stout-Hazard, about all of this from their beginnings, favorite projects, tips galore, and future of their business.

What inspired you to get involved in home furnishings in the first place?
We were frustrated with trying to find good furniture for our design clients. We found that most folks were resorting to buying furniture from the big names, where you could choose from just a couple of colors and sizes. We knew there was an audience looking for more variety, more colors, etc. At the same time, those big companies have to spend so much on their showrooms and catalogs and fake “sales” that they can’t deliver a very well-built product. We knew we could deliver higher-quality furniture if we focused on working one-on-one with our customers online. And that’s exactly what we did.
Was this a joint thing or did one of you have to convince the other somewhat to make this into a big business?
I think we were both excited about starting a new business together. The timing just happened to work out. Roger had spent over a decade on TV with all that that entails – flying around the country every week, living out of hotels, and not having much time to pursue design projects. I was a partner in a startup that was wrapping up. After a decade in the financial industry, I was ready for a change. Maybe we convinced each other a little bit!
Seeing as you both are a couple, do you find that the home furnishing business is pro LGBT, and have you ever encountered anything negative in your business due to your sexuality?
Yes, the furniture industry is pro-LGBT. There has always been a huge presence of LGBT folks in the world of design, including a lot of the biggest names in the industry. That said, as a group we’re very concerned about issues like North Carolina’s HB2 law (that’s their anti-LGBT “bathroom bill”). Much of the furniture manufacturing in the USA happens in North Carolina, and we collectively have to work to ensure the talented folks building our products are protected from discrimination. So there has been a lot of pressure from furniture manufacturers (along with most industries in the state) to get these laws repealed.
How would you exactly define “Roger and Chris” as a business in one sentence?
How about “serious designers that don’t take themselves too seriously”?
Credit: Chris Stout-Hazard
Is everything from your company handmade and domestic?
From the start, we decided that all of Roger + Chris’s products should be made in the USA. We think it’s the right thing to do for the economic health of our country, but it also gives us some important advantages – It means that we have the ability to custom build every piece to our customers’ specifications instead of mass producing overseas. Vegan or allergic to down? Not a problem; we can build your sofa with alternative materials. Want a lamp a bit taller or with a blue cord instead of a red one? We can do that. Just as important, we know exactly what chemicals are and aren’t being used in our products. It’s shocking to find out what goes into a lot of the imported furniture on the market. Building in the USA ensures not just the quality of the products but the conditions for the people crafting them.
What would you say is the biggest trend furniture wise for the summer and fall seasons?
The Bohemian look is everywhere right now. White walls, eclectic and colorful furniture, lots of Moroccan textiles, and tons of houseplants. For furniture, we’re seeing a lot of demand from designers for lighter, saddle-colored leather and olive green fabrics.
Do you have a favorite project that you have worked on so far, and why?
Every project has something exciting – we recently wrapped up a wine bar in Connecticut that featured a lot of our furniture and lighting that turned out beautifully, and we’re doing a number of residential projects that each have interesting features. But we probably have the most fun working on our own home. It’s a chance to really play and try out new ideas. Plus, when it’s finished, you get to hang out and enjoy it for a while.
Credit: Chris Stout-Hazard
What would you say are your biggest tips to new homeowners who really want to make their space flourish without it being too loud or dull?
Here’s the most important thing to remember when putting together your home or apartment. As a warning, it sounds simplistic, but it’s important nonetheless. IT’S OKAY TO LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE. We talk to many homeowners who struggle with making decisions, and much of the time they’re worried about impressing guests, or fitting in with what’s currently popular, or that they will be breaking some sort of rule if they deviate from what they’ve seen on HGTV. Design isn’t chemistry or physics – there are guidelines, but they aren’t laws. It’s your house, so give yourself permission to experiment, have fun, and surround yourself with things you love. Having a home that reflects your personality keeps you centered, and your guests will pick up on that too.
What would you say would be your biggest goal for Roger and Chris that you have your sights set on?
We just had our fourth birthday, but we’re still just warming up. Our goal at this point is to keep reaching new people, teaching them about design, and hooking them up with awesome furniture tailored to their needs.
What’s next for the two of you? 
A nap sounds good right about now!
