Case Studies


Lock LacesCase Study
if a photo of a smiling customer goes a long way in reinforcing your brand message and product value, imagine what thousands of photos will do.  That was the thinking behind Lock Laces recent social media photo contest, where customers took photos of their Lock Laces shoelaces and then posted then to their social media account for a chance to win a prize.

CruizersCase Study
When customers pull into a Cruizer’s gas station for a tank of gas and a cup of coffee, there is usually one through on their mind :  “How quickly can I make my purchase?”.  Convenience gas stations are known for their efficiency and each one of Cruizers twenty-five locations certainly excel at that.  But this leaves very little time for building brand engagement and customer loyalty.  This is why Cruizers and their ad agency – The Splinter Group – approached iValu8 for a new and compelling approach for connecting with customers. Download PDF »



Sports EndeavorsCase Study
Sports Endeavors is the largest retailer of soccer, lacrosse and rugby equipment in the world. It is the destination website for any high school or club league looking to outfit its players with the best in cleats, balls, sticks and uniforms.  When looking to drive sales at tournament events, Sports Endeavors turned to iValu8 to engage customers through fun campaigns.  Participants won product coupons, resulting in sales.
