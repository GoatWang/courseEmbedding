HSBC Private Bank's London office at 78 St James's Street


HSBC Private Bank is the principal private banking business of the HSBC Group. HSBC Private Bank's holding company is HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) S.A.. The holding company is wholly owned by British HSBC Bank plc and its subsidiaries include HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) S.A., HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited, HSBC Private Bank (C.I.) Limited, HSBC Private Bank (Luxembourg) S.A., HSBC Private Bank (Monaco) S.A. and HSBC Financial Services (Cayman) Limited.
HSBC Private Bank, together with the private banking business of HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG (operating as HSBC Trinkaus) known collectively as Global Private Banking, provides services to wealthy people and their families through 96 offices in some 43 countries and territories in Europe, the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa. At 31 December 2008, profits before tax were US$1,447 million and combined client assets under management were US$352 billion.
HSBC Guyerzeller Bank AG was a subsidiary HSBC Private Bank. In 2009 the HSBC Guyerzeller business was re-branded HSBC Private Bank.
In October 2012, HSBC Private Bank sold Property Vision Holdings Limited to PV Acquisition Limited in a 100% management buyout.[1] Property Vision was acquired by HSBC in 2001 and specialises in managing and providing advice on property purchases.[2] Property Vision's exit from HSBC was part of wider restructuring by the bank, which made 36 disposals of “non-core operating assets” in 2011-2012.[3]
HSBC has announced (20 October 2016) the transfer of the bulk of its private banking business in Monaco to CFM Indosuez Wealth Management. The current HSBC private banking business houses US$9bn of customer assets and employs 200 people. Those assets and parts of the business that do not transfer will be wound down.[4]

                Family succession: moments of truth
            

                Passing control from one generation to the next is a critical moment for a family business. It can be a positive, but often businesses lose momentum. It can bring a family together, but all too often it drives a family apart.

        Financing Services
    





                Financing plays a critical role in managing your wealth strategy. We offer a broad range of lending services for you, your family and your business, so that you can access your assets when you need them.
            







 Managing your wealth













            Financing Services
        

            Credit can be a valuable tool to access the funds you need without drawing on longer-term assets. With the global reach of our business, we provide valuable insights into the local regulations and economic forces that may influence how you borrow and invest.
        



Tailored Lending 


Our tailored lending service gives you customised borrowing options that can increase your liquidity, help protect your wealth and open up new opportunities for you and your family. Our credit advisory specialists have the ability to develop credit solutions to assist in financing and maximising assets that cannot be easily converted into funds. We customise strategies to unlock the potential value of your assets and help you meet your financial goals.



Marketable Securities Backed Finance 


We offer  financing secured by the liquid investments held within your HSBC Private Bank  portfolio. Using your marketable securities to meet short-term liquidity needs  helps pave the way to accomplishing your overall wealth management plans, while  keeping your long-term investment strategy intact. 



Residential Real Estate Finance 


Residential mortgages can be a simple and effective way to borrow, whether you are buying a new property, refinancing a residential mortgage or looking to create liquidity. Our bespoke mortgage service is designed to make the process as easy and flexible as possible. Working with high-net-worth-individuals and families around the world, we offer expertise with cross-border real estate investments.



Specialised Asset Finance  


Using your assets to raise finance opens up a vast range of options. Our experienced and innovative credit advisers can help you find the option that’s right for your needs. We will coordinate and simplify what can often be complex transactions. 






Risk Warning
Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage.

HSBC Private Bank's London office at 78 St James's Street


HSBC Private Bank is the principal private banking business of the HSBC Group. HSBC Private Bank's holding company is HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) S.A.. The holding company is wholly owned by British HSBC Bank plc and its subsidiaries include HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) S.A., HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited, HSBC Private Bank (C.I.) Limited, HSBC Private Bank (Luxembourg) S.A., HSBC Private Bank (Monaco) S.A. and HSBC Financial Services (Cayman) Limited.
HSBC Private Bank, together with the private banking business of HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG (operating as HSBC Trinkaus) known collectively as Global Private Banking, provides services to wealthy people and their families through 96 offices in some 43 countries and territories in Europe, the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa. At 31 December 2008, profits before tax were US$1,447 million and combined client assets under management were US$352 billion.
HSBC Guyerzeller Bank AG was a subsidiary HSBC Private Bank. In 2009 the HSBC Guyerzeller business was re-branded HSBC Private Bank.
In October 2012, HSBC Private Bank sold Property Vision Holdings Limited to PV Acquisition Limited in a 100% management buyout.[1] Property Vision was acquired by HSBC in 2001 and specialises in managing and providing advice on property purchases.[2] Property Vision's exit from HSBC was part of wider restructuring by the bank, which made 36 disposals of “non-core operating assets” in 2011-2012.[3]
HSBC has announced (20 October 2016) the transfer of the bulk of its private banking business in Monaco to CFM Indosuez Wealth Management. The current HSBC private banking business houses US$9bn of customer assets and employs 200 people. Those assets and parts of the business that do not transfer will be wound down.[4]

HSBC Private Bank (Suisse SA) has appealed against a record HK$605 million fine and the revocation of its advisory licence by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) over alleged misconduct related to the sale of Lehman Brothers-related structured products and some other forward accumulators between 2003 and 2008.
The hearing started on Wednesday and will last until at least May 12. It is being heard by Mr Justice Michael Hartmann, chairman of the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal. It follows a disciplinary decision by the SFC regarding the private banking arm of HSBC, the biggest lender in Hong Kong and Europe.
The HK$605 million fine is the largest ever imposed by the SFC on any broker or investment bank.
The SFC issued a statement in October saying HSBC Private Bank had applied to appeal against its decision.
In the statement, the SFC said the disciplinary action “concerns the bank’s internal controls and sales practices in connection with its sale of structured products – namely, Lehman Brothers-related notes and leveraged forward accumulators between 2003 and 2008”.

Former SFC chairman Anthony Neoh, the lawyer representing HSBC Private Bank, told the tribunal on Thursday that the penalty was excessive.
Besides the record-high fine, the SFC penalty also revoked the lender’s licence to advise on securities. HSBC Private Bank now has two licences from the SFC, include a type 1 licence for dealing in securities and a type 4 licence to advise on securities-related business.

During the hearing, Neoh said private bank clients were different from retail customers because private bank clients usually had more assets with the bank.
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, collapsed in 2008. That led to the derivative products linked to the bank becoming worthless and investors suffering losses.
