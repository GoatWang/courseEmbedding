Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC and Stewart Investment Advisers Announce Closing of Reorganization | Business Wire


























































      Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC and Stewart Investment Advisers Announce 
      Closing of Reorganization
    





March 23, 2015 09:25 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC and Stewart Investment Advisers today 
      announced the closing of the reorganization of Boulder Total Return 
      Fund, Inc. (NYSE:BTF), The Denali Fund Inc. (NYSE:DNY) and First 
      Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OTC:FOFI) – the acquired funds – into Boulder 
      Growth & Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: BIF) – with BIF continuing as the 
      surviving fund – on March 20, 2015.
    

      In the reorganization, BIF acquired all of the assets and liabilities of 
      BTF, DNY and FOFI in a tax-free transaction in exchange for common 
      shares of BIF. The BIF common shares, which are NYSE listed and freely 
      transferrable, will be distributed to stockholders of BTF, DNY and FOFI 
      in exchange for their shares of common stock of the respective acquired 
      funds. The reorganization occurred based on the relative net asset 
      values (NAV) of BIF, BTF, DNY and FOFI as of the end of the trading day 
      on March 20, 2015. Each fund’s NAV and the ratio of BIF shares to be 
      received for each share of the respective acquired fund is outlined 
      below:

      Each current holder of BIF shares will retain the same number of BIF 
      shares as held prior to the reorganization. A holder of BTF shares will 
      receive 3.121182 BIF shares for each BTF share owned; a holder of DNY 
      shares will receive 2.439214 BIF shares for each DNY share owned; and a 
      holder of FOFI shares will receive 1.111719 BIF shares for each FOFI 
      share owned. Fractional shares will be paid in cash.
    

      BIF will continue to operate as a registered, non-diversified, 
      closed-end investment company with the investment objective of providing 
      stockholders a high level of total return. BIF will seek to achieve that 
      objective by producing both income and long-term capital appreciation 
      investing in a portfolio of equity and debt securities.

Forward-Looking Statement


      Statements made in this press release that look forward in time involve 
      risks and uncertainties and are forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” 
      “estimate,” “project,” “assume,” “outlook,” “seek,” and similar 
      expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” 
      “should,” “could,” “may” or similar expressions identify forward-looking 
      statements, which generally are not historical in nature. 
      Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks 
      and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements 
      speak only as of the date they are made, and RMA and SIA assume no duty 
      to, and do not undertake to, update forward-looking statements. Actual 
      results could differ materially from those anticipated in 
      forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially 
      from historical performance. With respect to BIF, the following factors, 
      among others, could cause actual events to differ materially from 
      forward-looking statements or historical performance: the adverse effect 
      from a decline in the securities markets or a decline in BIF’s 
      performance, a general downturn in the economy, competition from other 
      companies, changes in government policy or regulation, inability to 
      attract and retain highly talented professionals, and unforeseen costs 
      and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of 
      governmental and self-regulatory organizations. BIF’s ability to pay 
      dividends to stockholders is subject to the restrictions in its 
      registration statement, Bylaws and other governing documents, as well as 
      the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Boulder Investment Advisers, LLC, Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC And Stewart West Indies Trading Company, Ltd. Announce Board Approval Of The Reorganization Of Four Closed-End Funds






Business Wire




Nov 4, 2013 4:15 PM EST













 




























































  Boulder Investment Advisers, LLC (“BIA”), Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC (“RMA”) and Stewart West Indies Trading Company, Ltd. (d/b/a Stewart Investment Advisers) (“SIA”) announced today that the Board of Directors (each a “Board” and collectively, the “Boards”) of each of Boulder Total Return Fund, Inc. (“BTF”), The Denali Fund Inc. (“DNY”), First Opportunity Fund, Inc. (“FOFI”) and Boulder Growth & Income Fund, Inc. (“BIF” and, together with BTF, DNY and FOFI, the “Funds”), have approved the reorganization of each of BTF, DNY and FOFI (the “Target Funds”) into BIF, with BIF continuing as the surviving fund (each, a “Reorganization” and collectively, the “Reorganizations”). The Reorganizations are contingent upon stockholder approval of each Reorganization and other conditions and contemplate, among other things, the following actions:   The assets of the Target Funds will be transferred to, and the liabilities of the Target Funds will be assumed by, BIF in exchange for shares of common stock of BIF (the “BIF Shares”). The BIF Shares will then be distributed to the respective Target Fund stockholders. The net asset value (not market value) of the BIF Shares received by the Target Fund stockholders in the Reorganization will equal the aggregate net asset value (not market value) of the respective Target Fund shares held by such stockholders as of the valuation date.    Certain other actions contemplated by the Reorganizations have been approved by the applicable Boards, subject to stockholder approval. Of these other actions, the following are conditions for the completion of the Reorganizations:   An amendment to FOFI’s Articles of Amendment and Restatement eliminating the right of stockholders to demand the fair value of their shares upon reorganization with another registered investment company in a family of investment companies having the same investment adviser or administrator as FOFI (the “FOFI Amendment”); and   The elimination of BIF’s fundamental investment policy limiting the ability to invest more than 4% of total assets in any single issuer (the “4% Policy Change”).    The applicable Boards also approved the following actions, subject to stockholder approval, which are not conditions for completion of the Reorganizations:   Upon effectiveness of the Reorganizations, BIF will adopt new investment advisory agreements. The new agreements will provide for a reduction in the current advisory fee (1.25% with a temporary fee waiver of 0.10%) to a new fee of 1.10% on assets under management up to $1 billion, 1.05% for assets between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, 1.00% for assets between $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion and 0.95% for assets exceeding $2.0 billion (the “Advisory Agreements”); and   Upon effectiveness of the Reorganizations, BIF will adopt a new fundamental investment policy for BIF such that it may not invest more than 10% of its net assets in “private funds” (e.g. hedge funds) (the “Hedge Fund Policy Change” and, together with the 4% Policy Change, the “Policy Changes”).    The Boards also determined that if the FOFI Amendment is not approved by FOFI stockholders, the Reorganizations, Advisory Agreements and Policy Changes will not be considered or voted upon by the respective stockholders.
