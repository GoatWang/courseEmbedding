      ■ The electronics retail executive W. Alan McCollough was chairman,
      president, and chief executive officer of the national technology-services
      and retail company Circuit City Stores, headquartered in Richmond,
      Virginia, as of 2004. McCollough took over the leadership of the company
      in June 2000—succeeding Richard L. Sharp, who remained chairman of
      the company—after 13 years of extensive experience in merchandising
      and store management, two of the retailer's primary operating
      areas.
    

      SECOND-LEADING U.S. ELECTRONICS RETAILER
    

      The primary business unit of Circuit City Stores was the Circuit City
      Group, which was the second-largest U.S. electronics retailer as of 2004
      (behind Best Buy Company, which had fewer stores in fewer markets but
      higher sales). Circuit City owned stores in over six hundred U.S.
      locations, with most designated as superstores—that is, as very
      large stores

      with broad selection and competitive prices selling a wide variety of
      products, including consumer electronics (such as audio and video
      equipment), personal computers, movies, music, games, and entertainment
      software. The Circuit City Web site provided shoppers with extensive
      product information, direct shipment of purchases, real-time inventory
      status of products in stores, and Express Pick-up, enabling customers to
      order goods online and obtain them at specified stores.
    

      The company previously ran over 30 shopping-mall-based Circuit City
      Express outlets. The company also established the used-car seller CarMax
      in 2002. At the time of McCollough's ascendancy to the helm of
      Circuit City, CarMax was the nation's leading specialty retailer of
      used cars and a rapidly growing new-car retailer. By 2004 there were 40
      CarMax locations across the United States.
    

      CIRCUIT OF LEADERSHIP
    

      McCollough began his professional career with the textile manufacturer
      Milliken and Company. Over his 12 years at Milliken, McCollough held
      various positions, including cost accountant, director of quality,
      manufacturing plant manager, and director of marketing. McCollough joined
      Circuit City in 1987 as general manager of corporate operations. Within
      two years he was named assistant vice president, directing the development
      of a large number of store operating procedures designed to promote
      quality and uniform service across the company's large and rapidly
      expanding store base. Along with these responsibilities McCollough led the
      implementation of the company's distributed point-of-sales system,
      which was used throughout the organization.
    

      From 1991 to 1994 McCollough was vice president of Circuit City and
      president of the company's central operating division, which
      comprised more than one-third of the company's stores. In 1994 he
      became senior vice president in charge of merchandising, a post that
      involved responsibilities for all merchandise selection, purchasing, and
      inventory management. During the next three years McCollough developed
      sturdy working relationships with the vendor community that extended over
      the entertainment-software, consumer-electronics, major-appliance, and
      personal-computer industries. McCollough became president and chief
      operating officer in 1997, which made him responsible for activities
      involving human relations and resources, management information systems,
      merchandising, store operations, and planning.
    

      McCollough became chief executive officer of Circuit City in June 2000. A
      few months before this time, the outgoing CEO Sharp said of McCollough,
      "Alan's extensive experience in the critical areas of our
      business, his commitment to our high-quality consumer offers, and his
      outstanding leadership talents make him the ideal person to guide our
      company into the next decade" (January 3, 2000). As CEO, McCollough
      directed the continuing growth and development of both the Circuit City
      and CarMax automobile superstore businesses. In June 2002 McCollough was
      elected chairman of the board of directors.
    

      LAGGING BEHIND BEST BUY IN 2000
    

      Upon becoming Circuit City's chief executive officer, McCollough
      found the company lagging behind Best Buy in such financial data as sales,
      sales per square foot, and return on investment. Although both stores saw
      slower sales in the first half of 2000, Best Buy doubled its stock value
      in the same period that Circuit City saw its value remain flat.
    

      McCollough began implementing a detailed plan involving a new store
      format, tests of a stand-alone appliance-only concept (in which a small
      store would sell only appliances), the rolling out of new merchandising
      displays, and continuation of the expanding digital-product cycle in
      consumer electronics. Circuit City would stock more products on store
      shelves and place registers near entrances, allowing consumers to more
      easily help themselves to products and to navigate the store in a more
      efficient manner—what McCollough called a
      "grab-andgo" climate. A combination of commissioned sales
      counselors and hourly employees were put in rotation at each store. This
      new employment policy contrasted the historically exclusive use of
      commissioned personnel; the switch helped reduce operating expenses.
    

      McCollough also expanded the number of high-technology products offered by
      Circuit City outlets, including digital cameras, 35-millimeter cameras,
      software titles, and video games. New merchandising displays were created
      in order to better highlight the products and services available through
      the various alliances the company maintained with companies such as AOL
      and Sony. By shifting Circuit City's product lines and introducing
      higher-margin, new-technology products, Mc-Collough hoped to rely less on
      sales from computers and other home-office products, whose profit margins
      continued to erode.
    

      ELIMINATING APPLIANCES
    

      McCollough initiated a plan to eliminate major appliances from the main
      Circuit City locations in order to provide more space on the selling floor
      and in the warehouse for the expanded product categories. While the
      company's gross margins for appliances were in line with other
      products, the storage and delivery costs of the oversized items were much
      greater than for smaller products. McCollough also added that the
      appliance category did not have the same growth potential as consumer
      electronics, as the selling of appliances was a cyclical business tied to
      housing starts and other economic factors. McCollough remarked that 70
      percent of customers bought appliances as replacements for older models.
    

      In the end McCollough found that the company needed an extra 20,000 square
      feet of additional floor space per store in order to accommodate all of
      the high-growth products it wanted to sell. With Lowe's, Home
      Depot, Sears, and other companies all involved in the appliance market,
      McCollough decided it would not be in the company's best interest
      to pursue further appliance sales.
    

      In 2000 McCollough opened 25 new stores and remodeled 30 to 35 existing
      stores, each with a new open, warehouse-style format—hardwood
      floors and bright signs replaced the former red, black, and chrome design
      scheme, and wider aisles, higher ceilings, and "great sight
      lines" were introduced. McCollough wanted the bold new atmosphere
      of Circuit City to impress customers from the moment they walked into
      stores. Test markets for the consumer electronic-only format included
       Richmond, Virginia, and Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Fort Meyers, and
      Orlando, Florida. Along with these actions, McCollough tested an
      appliance-only format in six standalone locations in Florida. McCollough
      also led Circuit City to implement an Internet-based training program for
      store-level associates.
    

      YEAR-END RESULTS
    

      By the beginning of the last quarter of 2000 Circuit City continued to lag
      behind Best Buy despite McCollough's initiatives. However,
      McCollough continued to believe that the new product cycle, format
      changes, and merchandising improvements would help Circuit City better
      compete with Best Buy. By the end of 2000 McCollough saw improvement in
      sales at existing stores that had undergone remodeling to replace the
      defunct appliance business. McCollough slowed the pace of total-store
      overhauls, hoping to strengthen the company's brand identity and
      returns on investment with a less expensive future remodel (that of $1.5
      million per store rather than $2.5 million).
    

      SEEING IMPROVEMENT
    

      In 2001 McCollough began a new marketing program designed to better
      communicate Circuit City's new look and product offerings to
      consumers. He hired Fiona Dias as senior vice president of marketing in
      order to run marketing as a separate division rather than as part of
      another division as had been done in the past. In the first part of 2001
      sales lost through the removal of appliances were balanced by overall
      sales increases resulting from overhauled store layouts and operations.
      Later in the year McCollough announced the company's new
      advertising slogan: "Circuit City—We're With
      You." McCollough sought to improve customer service through an
      overhaul of internal operations—using Six Sigma, an accepted
      business philosophy fostering customer satisfaction, as its guideline.
    

      STILL UNDECIDED WITH STORE FORMATS IN 2002
    

      McCollough spun off CarMax in the first quarter of 2002, after
      CarMax's business matured as customers bought used cars rather than
      new ones during the economic downturn of the early 2000s. McCollough hoped
      that separating the two businesses (Circuit City and CarMax) would permit
      the management of each to better focus on financial and operational
      objectives. With respect to Circuit City, after a year and a half of
      testing several formats and programs, the company had yet to determine a
      clear-cut remodeling plan for its aging store base.
    

      McCollough announced that Circuit City would redesign three hundred of its
      stores to house new video departments, complete with seating areas for the
      full home-theater experience, to better merchandise the high-growth
      television category; the company had already been doing this in all newly
      built stores. McCollough later announced that two other formats would also
      be tested, one in Chicago, Illinois, and another in the
      Baltimore–Washington, D.C., area. This announcement caused some
      disruption on Wall Street, as Circuit City had difficulty communicating
      with the analyst community. Such issues continued to have adverse affects
      on the company's stock price and analyst reports.
    

      2003 AND BEYOND
    

      At the beginning of 2003 McCollough continued to focus on updating Circuit
      City's store base, streamlining operations, and polishing its
      consumer image. After two full years in a state of transition, the chain
      store seemed unable to move forward. McCollough contended that the company
      had made much progress over those two years, although he admitted that the
      company still had a long way to go before accomplishing its goals. After
      successfully spinning off CarMax, McCollough abandoned the smaller,
      mall-based Circuit City Express stores and the stand-alone appliance
      concept, which had never truly materialized.
    

      McCollough's largest focus was on remodeling and redecorating
      Circuit City's existing stores. He expanded the home-office
      category, complete with personal computers, software, and accessories, and
      the entertainment software section, to help boost foot traffic and bring
      in younger consumers. However, Wall Street analysts were still unsure
      about the future of Circuit City, as they waited for the company to finish
      remodeling its store base and to announce a growth plan. Analysts felt
      both projects were long overdue, especially considering the opposition of
      Best Buy, which was far ahead in terms of the executing of a growth plan,
      brand positioning, and building of vendor relationships. While Circuit
      City had advanced several positive store prototypes, other stores remained
      outdated and poorly suited to the evolving consumer-electronics market.
    

      Over the nine months ending November 30, 2003, Circuit City revenues fell
      4 percent to $6.5 billion, paralleling the weak retail-sales environment
      caused by the general economic slowdown. Net losses from continuing
      operations rose 52 percent to $83.3 million, reflecting declining
      gross-profit margins and increased remodeling and relocation expenses.
      McCollough planned to move Circuit City to the next phase of its
      remodeling program in two hundred stores in 2004. However, the company had
      been on the remodeling path for some time and had yet to see improvements
      in returns.

W. Alan McCollough1950–
Chairman, president, and chief executive officer, Circuit City Stores 
Nationality: American.
Born: 1950.
Education: Missouri Valley College, BS, 1971; Southern Illinois University, MBA, 1974.
Career: U.S. Navy, minesweeper operations officer; Milliken and Company, cost accountant, director of quality, manufacturing plant manager, director of marketing; Circuit City Stores, 1987–1989, general manager of corporate operations; 1989–1991, assistant vice president; 1991–1994, president of central operating division and corporate vice president; 1994–1997, senior vice president of merchandising; 1997–2000, president and COO; 2000–2002, president and CEO; 2002–, chairman, president, and CEO.
Address: Circuit City Stores, 9950 Mayland Drive, Richmond, Virginia 23233; http://www.circuitcity.com.
■ The electronics retail executive W. Alan McCollough was chairman, president, and chief executive officer of the national technology-services and retail company Circuit City Stores, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, as of 2004. McCollough took over the leadership of the company in June 2000—succeeding Richard L. Sharp, who remained chairman of the company—after 13 years of extensive experience in merchandising and store management, two of the retailer's primary operating areas.
SECOND-LEADING U.S. ELECTRONICS RETAILER
The primary business unit of Circuit City Stores was the Circuit City Group, which was the second-largest U.S. electronics retailer as of 2004 (behind Best Buy Company, which had fewer stores in fewer markets but higher sales). Circuit City owned stores in over six hundred U.S. locations, with most designated as superstores—that is, as very large stores
with broad selection and competitive prices selling a wide variety of products, including consumer electronics (such as audio and video equipment), personal computers, movies, music, games, and entertainment software. The Circuit City Web site provided shoppers with extensive product information, direct shipment of purchases, real-time inventory status of products in stores, and Express Pick-up, enabling customers to order goods online and obtain them at specified stores.


The company previously ran over 30 shopping-mall-based Circuit City Express outlets. The company also established the used-car seller CarMax in 2002. At the time of McCollough's ascendancy to the helm of Circuit City, CarMax was the nation's leading specialty retailer of used cars and a rapidly growing new-car retailer. By 2004 there were 40 CarMax locations across the United States.
CIRCUIT OF LEADERSHIP
McCollough began his professional career with the textile manufacturer Milliken and Company. Over his 12 years at Milliken, McCollough held various positions, including cost accountant, director of quality, manufacturing plant manager, and director of marketing. McCollough joined Circuit City in 1987 as general manager of corporate operations. Within two years he was named assistant vice president, directing the development of a large number of store operating procedures designed to promote quality and uniform service across the company's large and rapidly expanding store base. Along with these responsibilities McCollough led the implementation of the company's distributed point-of-sales system, which was used throughout the organization.
From 1991 to 1994 McCollough was vice president of Circuit City and president of the company's central operating division, which comprised more than one-third of the company's stores. In 1994 he became senior vice president in charge of merchandising, a post that involved responsibilities for all merchandise selection, purchasing, and inventory management. During the next three years McCollough developed sturdy working relationships with the vendor community that extended over the entertainment-software, consumer-electronics, major-appliance, and personal-computer industries. McCollough became president and chief operating officer in 1997, which made him responsible for activities involving human relations and resources, management information systems, merchandising, store operations, and planning.
McCollough became chief executive officer of Circuit City in June 2000. A few months before this time, the outgoing CEO Sharp said of McCollough, "Alan's extensive experience in the critical areas of our business, his commitment to our high-quality consumer offers, and his outstanding leadership talents make him the ideal person to guide our company into the next decade" (January 3, 2000). As CEO, McCollough directed the continuing growth and development of both the Circuit City and CarMax automobile superstore businesses. In June 2002 McCollough was elected chairman of the board of directors.
LAGGING BEHIND BEST BUY IN 2000
Upon becoming Circuit City's chief executive officer, McCollough found the company lagging behind Best Buy in such financial data as sales, sales per square foot, and return on investment. Although both stores saw slower sales in the first half of 2000, Best Buy doubled its stock value in the same period that Circuit City saw its value remain flat.
McCollough began implementing a detailed plan involving a new store format, tests of a stand-alone appliance-only concept (in which a small store would sell only appliances), the rolling out of new merchandising displays, and continuation of the expanding digital-product cycle in consumer electronics. Circuit City would stock more products on store shelves and place registers near entrances, allowing consumers to more easily help themselves to products and to navigate the store in a more efficient manner—what McCollough called a "grab-andgo" climate. A combination of commissioned sales counselors and hourly employees were put in rotation at each store. This new employment policy contrasted the historically exclusive use of commissioned personnel; the switch helped reduce operating expenses.
McCollough also expanded the number of high-technology products offered by Circuit City outlets, including digital cameras, 35-millimeter cameras, software titles, and video games. New merchandising displays were created in order to better highlight the products and services available through the various alliances the company maintained with companies such as AOL and Sony. By shifting Circuit City's product lines and introducing higher-margin, new-technology products, Mc-Collough hoped to rely less on sales from computers and other home-office products, whose profit margins continued to erode.
ELIMINATING APPLIANCES
McCollough initiated a plan to eliminate major appliances from the main Circuit City locations in order to provide more space on the selling floor and in the warehouse for the expanded product categories. While the company's gross margins for appliances were in line with other products, the storage and delivery costs of the oversized items were much greater than for smaller products. McCollough also added that the appliance category did not have the same growth potential as consumer electronics, as the selling of appliances was a cyclical business tied to housing starts and other economic factors. McCollough remarked that 70 percent of customers bought appliances as replacements for older models.
In the end McCollough found that the company needed an extra 20,000 square feet of additional floor space per store in order to accommodate all of the high-growth products it wanted to sell. With Lowe's, Home Depot, Sears, and other companies all involved in the appliance market, McCollough decided it would not be in the company's best interest to pursue further appliance sales.


In 2000 McCollough opened 25 new stores and remodeled 30 to 35 existing stores, each with a new open, warehouse-style format—hardwood floors and bright signs replaced the former red, black, and chrome design scheme, and wider aisles, higher ceilings, and "great sight lines" were introduced. McCollough wanted the bold new atmosphere of Circuit City to impress customers from the moment they walked into stores. Test markets for the consumer electronic-only format included Richmond, Virginia, and Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Fort Meyers, and Orlando, Florida. Along with these actions, McCollough tested an appliance-only format in six standalone locations in Florida. McCollough also led Circuit City to implement an Internet-based training program for store-level associates.
YEAR-END RESULTS
By the beginning of the last quarter of 2000 Circuit City continued to lag behind Best Buy despite McCollough's initiatives. However, McCollough continued to believe that the new product cycle, format changes, and merchandising improvements would help Circuit City better compete with Best Buy. By the end of 2000 McCollough saw improvement in sales at existing stores that had undergone remodeling to replace the defunct appliance business. McCollough slowed the pace of total-store overhauls, hoping to strengthen the company's brand identity and returns on investment with a less expensive future remodel (that of $1.5 million per store rather than $2.5 million).
SEEING IMPROVEMENT
In 2001 McCollough began a new marketing program designed to better communicate Circuit City's new look and product offerings to consumers. He hired Fiona Dias as senior vice president of marketing in order to run marketing as a separate division rather than as part of another division as had been done in the past. In the first part of 2001 sales lost through the removal of appliances were balanced by overall sales increases resulting from overhauled store layouts and operations. Later in the year McCollough announced the company's new advertising slogan: "Circuit City—We're With You." McCollough sought to improve customer service through an overhaul of internal operations—using Six Sigma, an accepted business philosophy fostering customer satisfaction, as its guideline.
STILL UNDECIDED WITH STORE FORMATS IN 2002
McCollough spun off CarMax in the first quarter of 2002, after CarMax's business matured as customers bought used cars rather than new ones during the economic downturn of the early 2000s. McCollough hoped that separating the two businesses (Circuit City and CarMax) would permit the management of each to better focus on financial and operational objectives. With respect to Circuit City, after a year and a half of testing several formats and programs, the company had yet to determine a clear-cut remodeling plan for its aging store base.
McCollough announced that Circuit City would redesign three hundred of its stores to house new video departments, complete with seating areas for the full home-theater experience, to better merchandise the high-growth television category; the company had already been doing this in all newly built stores. McCollough later announced that two other formats would also be tested, one in Chicago, Illinois, and another in the Baltimore–Washington, D.C., area. This announcement caused some disruption on Wall Street, as Circuit City had difficulty communicating with the analyst community. Such issues continued to have adverse affects on the company's stock price and analyst reports.
2003 AND BEYOND
At the beginning of 2003 McCollough continued to focus on updating Circuit City's store base, streamlining operations, and polishing its consumer image. After two full years in a state of transition, the chain store seemed unable to move forward. McCollough contended that the company had made much progress over those two years, although he admitted that the company still had a long way to go before accomplishing its goals. After successfully spinning off CarMax, McCollough abandoned the smaller, mall-based Circuit City Express stores and the stand-alone appliance concept, which had never truly materialized.
McCollough's largest focus was on remodeling and redecorating Circuit City's existing stores. He expanded the home-office category, complete with personal computers, software, and accessories, and the entertainment software section, to help boost foot traffic and bring in younger consumers. However, Wall Street analysts were still unsure about the future of Circuit City, as they waited for the company to finish remodeling its store base and to announce a growth plan. Analysts felt both projects were long overdue, especially considering the opposition of Best Buy, which was far ahead in terms of the executing of a growth plan, brand positioning, and building of vendor relationships. While Circuit City had advanced several positive store prototypes, other stores remained outdated and poorly suited to the evolving consumer-electronics market.
Over the nine months ending November 30, 2003, Circuit City revenues fell 4 percent to $6.5 billion, paralleling the weak retail-sales environment caused by the general economic slowdown. Net losses from continuing operations rose 52 percent to $83.3 million, reflecting declining gross-profit margins and increased remodeling and relocation expenses. McCollough planned to move Circuit City to the next phase of its remodeling program in two hundred stores in 2004. However, the company had been on the remodeling path for some time and had yet to see improvements in returns.

									Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.  Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:
								

Modern Language Association
http://www.mla.org/style
The Chicago Manual of Style
http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
American Psychological Association
http://apastyle.apa.org/

Notes:


										Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers.  Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content.  However, the date of retrieval is often important.  Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.
									

										In addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations.  Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list. 
									





















































































W. Alan McCollough proverb and quote - The world's largest proverb collection for the Nordic countries!Hello! My name is Pex!I hope you'll like my proverb collection - I have been collecting for more than 27 years!I wish you a wonderful time here at nordicquotes.com! / Pex TufvessonP.S. Hug someone, just anyone... :)14 ordspråk av W. Alan McCollough W. Alan McCollough L�s om W. Alan McCollough p� Google eller Bing.  Hitta foto... Although we had anticipated modest sales disruption related to our exit from the appliance business and the partial remodel of all stores, since the end of September, sales have softened significantly in virtually all product categories, including those not affected by the remodeling process, Continued strength of the consumer electronics and home office categories and the recent substantial weakness in major appliances accelerated our decision to reformat all existing superstores, Continued strength of the consumer electronics and home office categories and the recent substantial weakness in major appliances accelerated our decision to reformat all existing superstores. The major appliance business carries high fixed costs and tends to be more cyclical than other retail categories. I believe we have made an exciting announcement for the future of our company. It will strategically reposition our company to focus exclusively on consumer, home office and entertainment. I am convinced the time to move forward is now. In December we saw strength in a broad number of categories, but we saw significant strength in flat panel televisions, MP3 players and accessories, notebook computers, video game hardware, navigation products and imaging products. Near term, we have seen a softening in our business, coincident with the onset of the war with Iraq. We believe the softening reflects consumer preoccupation with geopolitical events. It is too early, however, to understand the impact these events may have on results for the first quarter. Our record December sales results are further evidence of the great work being done by Associates throughout our company. More effective advertising, improved inventory in-stock levels and a tightly integrated multi-channel offering helped drive the year-over-year improvement. A strong increase in the average ticket size more than offset a reduction in traffic, compared with the prior year. Our record December sales results are further evidence of the great work being done by associates throughout our company. They executed an effective holiday season plan, which we believe translated into a superior customer experience in all of our sales channels. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the people who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. Our donation is part of Circuit City's broader effort to help the victims recover. Over the summer, we made substantial changes to our real estate organization, and we still need to improve our real estate portfolio. While we expect some increase in the pace of new and relocated store openings in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, we expect to derive benefits from these changes in fiscal 2008 and beyond. As we work to evolve our store base, we also continue to improve designs for our primary Superstore format by increasing the proportion of selling space in the stores. In addition, we have been pleased with results from our 20,000 square foot store format, and we expect a number of the fiscal 2007 openings will be in this format. The first-quarter comparable stores sales growth was slightly ahead of our expectations, with sales exceeding our outlook early in the quarter, but softening during the final month. We believe our guaranteed express pickup offering, which enabled customers to shop for Christmas gifts over the Web through Christmas Eve, was a competitive advantage during the month. We remain dissatisfied in the overall sales performance of our Circuit City business, ... no new trends on which to base any charges in earnings expectations. We view the additional advertising expense during the quarter as an important investment in building the Circuit City brand. Since our retail stores team held labor expense relatively flat on a dollar basis, we were able to gain significant leverage on our higher level of sales as we continued work to optimize the labor model in our stores.NordicQuotes.comNumber of proverbs are 1466250varav 1407627 p� engelskaProverb (1466250 st) SearchCategories (2627 st) Search

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
