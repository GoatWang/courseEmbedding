Introduction




Historical perspective: After enduring decades of civil warfare among ethnic groups as well as invasions by Libya, Chad got started toward a more stable state with the seizure of the government in early December 1990 by former northern guerrilla leader Idress DEBY. His transitional government eventually suppressed armed  rebellion in all quarters of the country, settled the territorial dispute with Libya on terms favorable to Chad, produced a democratic constitution which was ratified by popular referendum in March 1996, held multiparty national presidential elections in June and July 1996 (DEBY won with 67% of the vote), and held multiparty elections to the National Assembly in January and February 1997, in which Idress DEBY's party, Patriotic Salvation Movement or MPS, won a majority of the seats.

Economy




Economy - overview: Unfavorable climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment,
and lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries
in the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, drought, and food
shortages. Consequently the economy has shown little progress in recent years
in overcoming a severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s.
About 85% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.
Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of exports. Chad
is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food credits, given chronic
food shortages in several regions. Of all the Francophone countries in Africa,
Chad has benefited the least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies
on 12 January 1994. Despite an increase in external financial aid and price
increases for cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt
and enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to postpone payment of public
sector salaries and to dampen economic enterprise by neglecting payments to
domestic suppliers. The devaluation resulted in stepped-up inflation of 41%
in 1994; inflation fell to 9% in 1995 but it remains high compared with other
Francophone countries. In one favorable development, Chad in December 1996
concluded an agreement with ESSO/Chad (EXXON) for drilling and extracting
petroleum at Doba. Oil will be piped through Cameroon for export.

Ikea's Idea Man Reveals How to Discover Your Own Million-Dollar Idea


The process is called vu jàdé. That's déjà vu backwards, and anyone can do it.

His company counts the who's who of global brands as clients -- Apple, Bank of America, Ikea, and Microsoft (to name a few). Who knows who he works with under strict nondisclosure.
The mission: Design products and services that fly off the shelves. The firm: Ideo. The man: Tom Kelley.
He recently sat down with Bobby Ghoshal and Jared Erondu for the podcast High Resolution. He shared five ideas for anyone looking to innovate and come up with the next million-dollar idea.
1. You have to know what problem to solve.
You don't know what problem to solve. Even if you think you do, you don't. This runs counter to what you might think.
To find the problem, you must look at something with a fresh perspective -- as if you know nothing about it. He calls it vu jàdé (déjà vu, backwards).
2. You have to withhold your agenda.
When looking for a million-dollar idea, don't go into the process looking for examples that support your gut feeling or what you think you know.
3. You have to set aside what you know.
Set aside everything you know. Don't think "it's always done this way" or "it should be done that way." Make and record observations without judgment or opinion.
4. You have to ask: "What was the person thinking?"
Wherever you decide to look, observe people doing whatever it is they do.
Then, without agenda or judgment, ask yourself what that person was thinking when she was doing her thing. This is where insights will start coming.
5. You have to ask: "What was the person feeling?"
Asking what a person was feeling will give you perspective on why she did what she did. It will reveal the emotion of the situation. It will reveal frustrations.
According to Tom, when you blend the thinking and feeling part of the equation, you'll find opportunities for innovation. That's the part most people miss, but that's where million-dollar ideas come from.
Forget what you think you know to find out what you need to know
Looking at things with a fresh perspective means forgetting everything you know. That also means it's OK to look at industries you know nothing about. How's that for counterintuitive?
But what Tom Kelley, and IDEO does, works. Try it.
Observe without judgment, and who knows, you could be one of the next up-and-coming Inc. 5000 founders.
