principal stockholder, controls the outcome of matters on which our
stockholders are entitled to vote and its interests may be different from
yours.
Vorini
Holdings, which is controlled by our chief executive officer, Polys Hajioannou,
and our former chief operating officer, Nicolaos Hadjioannou, owns
approximately 81.64% of our outstanding common stock. This stockholder is able
to control the outcome of matters on which our stockholders are entitled to
vote, including the election of our entire board of directors and other
significant corporate actions. The interests of this stockholder may be
different from yours.
We are a controlled
company under the New York Stock Exchange rules, and as such we are
entitled to exemption from certain New York Stock Exchange corporate
governance standards, and you may not have the same protections afforded to
stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock
Exchange corporate governance requirements.
We are a
controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange
corporate governance standards. Under the New York Stock Exchange rules, a
company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another company
or group is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain
New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including: (a)
the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of
independent directors, (b) the requirement that the nominating committee be
composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter
addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities, (c) the
requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent
directors and have a written charter addressing the committees purpose and
responsibilities and (d) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation of
the corporate governance, nominating and compensation committees. We may
utilize these exemptions. As a result, non-independent directors, including
members of our management who also serve on our board of directors, will
comprise the majority of our board of directors and may serve on the corporate
governance, nominating and compensation committee of our board of directors
which, among other things, reviews the compensation of certain members of our
management and resolves governance issues regarding our company. Accordingly,
in the future you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of
companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate
governance requirements.
