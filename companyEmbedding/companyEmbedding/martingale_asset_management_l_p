A theory in modern mathematics.

Martingale Asset Management LP in 2008 13030 Funds and a Low-Volatility Strategy Harvard Case Solution & Analysis

Martingale Asset Management LP in 2008 13030 Funds and a Low-Volatility Strategy Case Solution
QUESTION # 01: Which issues should investors consider when deciding whether to invest in a 130/30 fund? Is Martingale well suited to manage 130/30 funds successfully?
ANSWER # 01:
130/30 is known as short extension strategy. Short extension strategy or 130/30 is a type of investment that returns with a minimum level of risk associated with it. 130/30 ratio indicates that stock shorting can only be exercisedup to the 30% of the portfolio. The basic knowledge of the investment is the return on investment which the investor should consider in any project which he has to invest in. These are the basic circumstances in which investment first looks out the criteria of the invested company. One more thing which investor has to look the matters is that the potentiality on the project and the number of years in which investment will be returned back. Furthermore the quality of the investment project is as follows with the depth, details about the one thirty/thirty.

Market Sustainability
Business Nature
Law and Regulation of the economy
Financial Position in the company

Moreover, in the market sustainability the investor considers the market environment in which the business is operating. An investorshould lookat the internal and external environment of the organization that what are the risk associated with the internal environment and external environment of the business. Industry growth is also another factor that the investor should consider while making an investment in the project of the company that what is the expected growth the industry in which the company is operating, an industry retention ratio that what the company has retained and investors would also look at the returns of the company and industry in which the investor is investing.
The investors should also consider the nature of business in which it is operating and industry nature in which the company is operating. An investor should also look at the industry average returnsand compare these returns with the company average return and earning make its investment more effective and efficient. Company going concern should bechecked by the investor before making an investment that how long company will able to survive in the industry.
Laws and regulation of the economy should be considered by the investors before its investment that the environment of the company is stable, rule and regulation implemented in the company, taxes imposed on the organization, under what the tax regime company is falling, and also look at the political influence of the government and other political parties in the operation of the business.
The financial statement is the key for the investor to analyze the returns generated by the company, what are the strategies adopted by the organization. Financial ratios tell the actual worth of the company, different financial ratios of financial management tells the return on the company’s investment and policies adopted by them. Key financial ratios to be undertaken are returns on equity, return on assets, Du Pont analysis and some other key financial ratios which tells the actual performance of the company.
Martingale asset management well manages the fund 130/30 that the company has generated a good return on its fund, financial ratio calculated on these funds shows that 130/30 fund is the best investment opportunity for the investors.The different financial ratios, such as returns on assets and return on equity show constant return, on the other hand standard deviation of the company shows the less deviation. These financial ratios indicate that funds are well managed by the company.
QUESTION # 02:Is it a good idea to invest in low volatility strategies? If so, is a 130/30 structure a good way of doing it?
Low volatility strategies give high returns as compared to high volatility strategy, as there is a high level of risk associated with the strategy. The Russell 1000 index is the best benchmark set for the low volatile strategies that index return is good investment opportunities at a high level of risk at high returns.Strategies having low volatility would not incorporate the transaction cost and management fees or any other cost into it. The strategy also comprises the performance on the basis of the returns that were already calculated having the gross return on the portfolio. These returns also include the capital gains on invested capital and dividend income based on the holdings of the investments.
Martingale Assets Management has the standard fee that is chargedfor long-only volatilitystrategy and that fee is 0.70% of its first fund that is around $25 million and.30% on remaining fund balance. So the results show that investment in the low volatility strategy is better in terms of returns and investment must be made in this strategy…………….

The purpose of the meeting was to review the backtesting real-time results of investment in new minimum variance strategy within the Fund 130/30. Performance results have been very encouraging, but Bill still wondering if they were a fluke of data, analysis of data, and not a reflection of the true anomaly of the market. He wanted to discuss several possible explanations for this phenomenon, and to decide whether the martingale strategy should offer to their customers. “Hide

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 2 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $32.00 (12.66% downside)

Consensus Ratings for Casella Waste Systems (NASDAQ:CWST) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $15.33 (10.02% downside)

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.

Our Latest Thinking











Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
