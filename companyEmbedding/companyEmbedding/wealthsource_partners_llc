The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Wealth, Simplified.

 



























Our Story







Created For the Client
WealthSource Partners, LLC was created as a result of a collective partnership of two independent firms, Avant-Garde Advisors and Vellum Financial, both founded separately in 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis. The founders of both firms believed that too often, large insurance companies, banks, and brokerage firms put their own needs ahead of their clients and that clients’ interests were not being served; so they set out to offer a different approach. Fast forward to 2016 and WealthSource Partners was born. Our goal is simple: Provide independent financial advice, delivered by human advisors, that leverages state of the art technology for the ultimate client experience.




Technology Supported, Advisor Driven
Building WealthSource Partners from the ground up gave us the opportunity to focus on enhancing the client relationship and experience. Technology and service are two areas where we felt that larger firms were failing their clients. Our firm was built on 21st century technology systems that are secure, scalable and intuitive to the end user, reducing errors and inefficiency in the investment and planning process. Technology is utilized to enhance your human advisor’s relationship with you, not replace it.










The Fiduciary Standard of Care
As defined by the Financial Planning Coalition, “The fiduciary standard of care requires that a financial adviser act solely in the client’s best interest when offering personalized financial advice.” Our goal is to provide you with the highest level of investment advice designed with your best interests in mind.




Am I a Good Match?

Do you like sitting on the phone listening to prompts?
Are your closest friends your tablet and Desktop Computer?
Do you enjoy the lack of connection between you and your current advisor?

If you answered yes to any of these questions you probably are not a good fit. If you have investable assets and are looking for an alternative to having a computer tell you what to do, then we might be a good solution. Click “Contact Us” to have one of our human advisors contact you.
