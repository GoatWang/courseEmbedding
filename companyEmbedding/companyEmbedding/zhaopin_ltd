How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.              
              
            

12:40 p.m. July 28, 2017






What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?              
              
            

5:47 p.m. July 27, 2017






Put your money where your mindset is
              
              Socially conscious mutual funds invest in ways that can be good for society and your portfolio.

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.              
              
            

6:14 p.m. July 28, 2017






These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

BEIJING, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Zhaopin Limited (NYSE:    ZPIN) ("Zhaopin" or the "Company"), a leading career platform1 in China focused on connecting users with relevant job opportunities through their career lifecycle, today announced that the final amount of the Special Dividend (as defined in and determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement as discussed below) was determined to be US$0.94 per ordinary share (each, a "Share"), or US$1.88 per American Depositary Share, each representing two Class A ordinary shares (each, an "ADS"). 








As previously announced, on April 6, 2017 the Company entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with SEEK International Investments Pty Ltd. ("SEEK International"), the current controlling shareholder of the Company, and Zebra Mergerco, Ltd. ("Merger Company"), a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated by an affiliate of Hillhouse Capital Management, Ltd. and an affiliate of FountainVest Partners, pursuant to which, Merger Company will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as the surviving company (the "Surviving Company") under Cayman Islands law (the "Merger"). Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company's board of directors resolved to declare a cash special dividend (the "Special Dividend") of an amount not less than US$0.28 and not more than US$1.35 per Share (corresponding with a minimum of US$0.56 and maximum of US$2.70 per ADS) to holders of record of issued and outstanding Shares and ADSs as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time").
Today, the Company declared the final amount of the Special Dividend as US$0.94 per Share (corresponding with US$1.88 per ADS), which was determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Payment of the Special Dividend is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and is to be made by the Company as soon as practicable (and no later than three business days) following the Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, the Special Dividend will be paid to the ADS Depositary, in its capacity as the depositary of our ADS program and the record holder of the Shares underlying our ADSs, in U.S. dollars, and the ADS Depositary will then distribute the applicable amounts in U.S. dollars to the holders of ADSs according to the terms of the Deposit Agreement, less the fees and expenses (if any) payable thereunder.
Additional Information about the Transaction
On April 6, 2017, the Company furnished to the SEC a report on Form 6-K which included as an exhibit thereto the Merger Agreement. All parties desiring details regarding the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are urged to review the Merger Agreement, which is available at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).  
In connection with the Merger, the Company will prepare and mail a proxy statement to its shareholders. In addition, certain participants in the Merger will prepare and mail to the Company's shareholders a Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement that will include the proxy statement. These documents will be filed with or furnished to the SEC. INVESTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY THESE MATERIALS AND OTHER MATERIALS FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, AS THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED MATTERS. In addition to receiving the proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement by mail, shareholders also will be able to obtain these documents, as well as other filings containing information about the Company, the Merger and related matters, without charge, from the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov) or at the SEC's public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549.
The Company and certain of its directors, executive officers and other members of management and employees may, under SEC rules, be deemed to be "participants" in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders with respect to the Merger. Information regarding the persons or entities who may be considered "participants" in the solicitation of proxies will be set forth in the proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement relating to the Merger when it is filed with the SEC. Information regarding certain of these persons and their beneficial ownership of the Company's ordinary shares as of August 31, 2016 is also set forth in the Company's Form 20-F, which was filed with the SEC on October 13, 2016. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in the proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement and the other relevant documents filed with the SEC when they become available.
This announcement is neither a solicitation of proxy, an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities and it is not a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC should the Merger proceed.
About Zhaopin Limited
Zhaopin is a leading career platform in China, focusing on connecting users with relevant job opportunities throughout their career lifecycle.

The Company's over 135.0 million registered users include diverse and educated job seekers who are at various stages of their careers and are in demand by employers as a result of the general shortage of skilled and educated workers in China.

The quality and quantity of Zhaopin's users and the resumes in the Company's database attract an increasing number of customers. This in turn leads to more users turning to Zhaopin as their primary recruitment and career- related services provider, creating strong network effects and significant entry barriers for potential competitors.

Safe Harbor Statements 
This news release may include certain statements that are not descriptions of historical facts, but are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "if," "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, uncertainties as to the expected benefits and costs of the proposed Merger; the expected timing of the completion of the Merger; the parties' ability to complete the Merger considering the various closing conditions, including any conditions related to regulatory approvals; the possibility that various closing conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied or waived; how the Company's shareholders will vote at the meeting of shareholders; the possibility that competing offers will be made and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement and the proxy statement to be filed by the Company in connection with the Merger. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.




 1 Zhaopin's website is the most popular career platform in China as measured by average daily unique visitors in each of the 12 months ended March  31, 2017, the number of registered users as of March 31, 2017 and the number of unique customers for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 





 2 A "unique customer" refers to a customer that purchases the Company's online recruitment services during a specified period. Zhaopin makes adjustments for multiple purchases by the same customer to avoid double counting. Each customer is assigned a unique identification number in the Company's information management system. Affiliates and branches of a given customer may, under certain circumstances, be counted as separate unique customers. 





 3 Zhaopin calculates the number of job postings by counting the number of newly placed job postings during each respective period. Job postings that were placed prior to a specified period - even if available during such period - are not counted as job postings for such period. Any particular job posting placed on the Company's website may include more than one job opening or position.

We estimate that we will receive (i) net proceeds from this offering of
approximately US$66.7 million, or approximately US$77.2 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us and (ii) net proceeds of approximately US$14.1 million from the
Concurrent Private Placement after deducting estimated fees and expenses payable
by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives in a listed company and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placement for our geographic expansion, product development, upgrade of
our information technology system and website, and working capital and general
corporate purposes, including strategic investments and potential acquisition
opportunities. We may also use the net proceeds from this offering and the
Concurrent Private Placement to repay part or all of our existing bank loans
incurred for the repurchase of Series E preferred shares from Macquarie Zhaopin
Holdings Limited with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately
RMB420 million (US$67.6 million) as of the date of this prospectus, although we
have not determined the exact amount of the proceeds that will be used for loan
repayment. The interest rates of these loans range from 1% above one month LIBOR
per annum to 2.95% above three-month LIBOR per annum and the maturity dates of
these facilities range from April 2015 to April 2016.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering.
However, we will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net
proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions
change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described
in this prospectus. To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net
proceeds we receive from this offering are not immediately applied for the above
purposes, we plan to invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing debt
instruments or bank deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering and the Concurrent Private Placement, as
an offshore holding company, we are permitted under the PRC laws and regulations
to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital
contributions and to our PRC affiliated entities only through loans, subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements.
There are no costs associated with registering loans or capital contributions
with relevant PRC authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC
laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to grant
approvals and complete registrations or deny our application within 90 days for
capital contributions, although the actual time taken may be longer due to
administrative delay. PRC laws and regulations do not provide an explicit
timeline for approvals or registrations of loans to PRC subsidiaries or
affiliated entities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We are
prohibited from converting registered capital in foreign exchange into Renminbi
for the purpose of domestic equity investment, granting certain entrusted loans,
repayment of inter-company loans, and repayment of bank loans which have been
transferred to a third party. Our ability to transfer capital to our
consolidated affiliated entities through our PRC subsidiaries, including our
joint venture, may be significantly restricted, which may adversely affect the
ability of our consolidated affiliated entities to expand their business
operations.

Our PRC subsidiaries can utilize the proceeds of this offering through
shareholder loans or capital contributions after obtaining approval from, and
completing registration with, the applicable PRC governmental authorities for
approved purposes specified in the business licenses of our PRC subsidiaries.
Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries can utilize the proceeds of this offering to
conduct product development, upgrade information technology system and provide 
services to our PRC affiliated entities, and our joint venture can utilize the 
proceeds of this offering to carry out geographic expansion by establishing 
new branch offices, which are permitted under their respective business 
licenses. However, our PRC subsidiaries’ licenses do not specifically authorize 
equity investments. As a result, none of our PRC subsidiaries is allowed to use 
such funds to make any equity investment in the PRC by means of establishing 
new subsidiaries or acquiring an equity interest in other entities in China. 
This limitation could adversely affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to 
expand their business operations and may impact our planned use of proceeds. 
For example, we may not be able to use our proceeds for strategic investment 
or acquisition in China through our PRC subsidiaries.


We face competition in our various lines of services from direct competitors 
such as 51job.com , as well as from local job-search websites. Other large 
internet companies, social networking services websites and generalist 
classified advertisement websites have also entered the market for online 
recruitment services. In addition, we face competition from professional 
networking websites and existing participants in the offline recruitment 
industry who may develop online recruitment services and products.

Although the barriers to entry for establishing many types of internet-based 
businesses are low, we believe that certain key features in our online 
recruitment business, together with our scale and market position in China, 
make it difficult for competitors to grow quickly and compete successfully 
against us. Specifically, we believe that our brand name in China’s online 
recruitment industry, the size and growth rate of our databases of job seekers 
and job postings, our customer relationships and in-depth knowledge of the 
online recruitment sector and our ability to offer a variety of complementary, 
value-added services to customers provides us with a significant advantage over 
our competitors.


Company Description
We are a leading career platform in China, focusing on connecting users with
relevant job opportunities throughout their career lifecycle. Our zhaopin.com
website is the most popular career-focused website in China as measured by
average daily unique visitors in each month of 2013, according to the


 iResearch
Public Data. We are the second largest online recruitment services provider as
measured by revenues in 2013, according to the iResearch Public Data. Our over
77 million registered users include diverse and educated job seekers who are at
various stages of their careers and are in demand by employers as a result of
the general shortage of skilled and educated workers in China. In the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2013 and the nine months ended March 31, 2014, over 10.5
million and 11.4 million job postings were respectively placed on our platform
by approximately 250,000 and 274,450 employers including multinational
corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises and state-owned entities. The
quality and quantity of our users and the resumes in our database attract an
increasing number of customers. This in turn leads to more users turning to us
as their primary recruitment and career-related services provider, creating
strong network effects and significant entry barriers for potential competitors.

Since our inception in 1994, we have capitalized on our early-mover advantage as
an online career-related services provider to build a leading brand in China.
Our “Zhaopin” brand, which means “hire” or “recruit” in Chinese, has 
contributed to our success. We focus on educated and skilled users, which 
positions us favorably in industries that contain high percentages of 
white-collar positions, where there are shortages of skilled labor. We 
understand the needs of both users and employers and, as a result, our platform 
is well-positioned to best match users with relevant job opportunities 
provided by employers.

Benefiting from our strong brand, our leading market position and our focus on
industries with high hiring demand, we have achieved significant growth in our
operations in recent years, as highlighted by the following data:

. We had over 1.9 million average daily unique visitors to our websites and  
  mobile applications in the nine months ended March 31, 2014;

. We had 77.1 million registered users as of March 31, 2014, representing an 
  increase of 18.0% from March 31, 2013;

. Approximately 11.4 million job postings were placed on our online platform 
  by 274,450 unique customers in the nine months ended March 31, 2014,       
  representing increases of 55.6% and 28.5%, respectively, from the nine     
  months ended March 31, 2013; and

. Approximately 56.9 million completed resumes were available in our database
  as of March 31, 2014, representing an increase of 19.0% from March 31, 2013.

Our revenues are driven in part by the number of unique customers who purchase
our services and more specifically, by the number of job postings and display
advertisements they place on our platform and the number of completed resumes
they download from our database. Although we do not directly generate revenues
from job-seekers for using our services, our large and increasing number of
registered users is a key indicator of the scale of our platform, which enable
us to encourage our existing customers to purchase more services and to attract
new customers.

We provide a broad range of services, including online recruitment, campus
recruitment, assessment and other human resources related services. Through our
zhaopin websites and mobile applications, we provide classified job postings and
display advertisements, resume access services and other online services. We
provide campus recruitment services primarily to customers seeking to recruit
college and university students. These services include selecting campuses,
organizing recruiting events, collecting and managing resumes and conducting
interviews and assessment tests with candidates. We provide online and offline
assessment services to assist customers in evaluating capabilities and
dispositions of their job candidates and existing employees. Our other human
resources related services mainly include executive search.

Our growth is supported by our nationwide sales and customer services
network. We have a large sales and customer service team with strong recruitment
and human resources expertise, local market knowledge and deep understanding of
industry verticals to assist us in best serving our customers’ needs. As of
March 31, 2014, we employed more than 2,000 sales and account management
representatives located in 32 regional offices across China and our headquarter
and call center in Beijing.
