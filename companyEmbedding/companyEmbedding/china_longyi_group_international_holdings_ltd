	CHINA LONGYI GROUP INTERNATIONL HOLDINGS LIMITED

	Notes to
	unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Unaudited)

	June 30, 2016


	The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America (US GAAP) for financial information and with
	the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
	they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for
	annual financial statements. These unaudited consolidated financial statements
	should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidation financial
	statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
	10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair
	presentation have been included. The unaudited consolidated financial statements
	of China Longyi Group International Holdings Limited (the Company or China
	Longyi) include the accounts of China Longyi and its wholly-owned and
	majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
	have been eliminated in consolidation.

	indirect Chinese subsidiaries Beijing SOD and Chongqing SOD. Through our Chinese
	subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture and market our SOD products in China. SOD
	is a naturally occurring enzyme which may act as a potent antioxidant defense in
	cells that are exposed to oxygen.

	BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND ORGANIZATION (Continued)





	CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS


	The directors, executive officers,
	affiliates and related parties own, beneficially and in the aggregate, the
	majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the common stock of
	the Company. Accordingly, if they voted their shares uniformly, directors,
	executive officers and affiliates would have the ability to control the approval
	of most corporate actions, including increasing the authorized capital stock of
	China Longyi and the dissolution, merger or sale of the Company's assets.


	GOING CONCERN


	The Company has earned only
	insignificant revenues since its inception. As at June 30, 2016, the Company has
	a working capital deficiency of $1,416,249 and accumulated deficit from
	recurring net losses of $30,947,897 incurred for the current and prior years as
	of June 30, 2016. As at June 30, 2016, the Company has cash and cash equivalents
	of $84,702.


	The Companys ability to continue as a
	going concern ultimately is dependent on the managements ability to obtain
	equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve
	profitable operations. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not
	include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
	recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might
	be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION


	The unaudited consolidated financial
	statements for all periods presented include the financial statements of China
	Longyi Group International Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries: Top Team
	Holdings Limited, Full Ample Group Limited (Daykeen Group, BVI), Top Time
	International Limited (HK), Beijing SOD, and Chongqing SOD. The unaudited
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.


	The Company has determined the Peoples
	Republic of China Chinese Yuan Renminbi (RMB) to be its functional currency.
	The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in
	United States (US) dollars. The unaudited consolidated financial statements are
	translated into US dollars from RMB at quarter-end exchange rates for assets and
	liabilities, and weighted average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.
	Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the
	capital transactions occurred.


	RMB is not freely convertible into the
	currency of other nations. All such exchange transactions must take place
	through authorized institutions. There is no guarantee the RMB amounts could
	have been, or could be, converted into US dollars at rates used in translation.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN SUBSIDIARIES


	The Company owns 90% of the equity
	interests in Beijing SOD, and the remaining 10% is owned by Miss Ran Wang.
	Therefore, the Company records non-controlling interest expense to allocate 10%
	of the loss of the Beijing SOD to Miss Ran Wang, its non-controlling
	shareholder.


	The Company owns 81% of the equity
	interest in Chongqing SOD of which 9% is owned by Miss Ran Wang, and the
	remaining 10% by Mr. Guoqing Tan. Therefore, the Company records non-controlling
	interest charge in the statement of operations to allocate 19% of the results of
	operations of Chongqing SOD to its non-controlling shareholders.


	USE OF ESTIMATES


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
	contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
	results could differ from those estimates.


	SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES


	Several areas require significant
	management estimates relating to uncertainties for which it is reasonably
	possible that there will be a material change in the near term. The more
	significant areas requiring the use of management estimates related to
	determination of net realizable value of inventory, allowance for doubtful
	accounts, property and equipment, accrued liabilities, and the useful lives for
	depreciation.


	REVENUE RECOGNITION


	Revenue is recognized when persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, delivery
	has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales
	proceeds. The Company generally obtains purchase authorizations from its
	customers for a specified amount of products at a specified price and considers
	delivery to have occurred when the customer takes title of the products.


	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT


	Property, plant and equipment are
	recorded at cost. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while
	repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Equipment purchased
	for specific research and development projects with no alternative uses are
	expensed. Assets under construction are not depreciated until construction is
	completed and the assets are ready for their intended use. Gains and losses from
	the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in loss on disposal
	and impairment of property, plant and equipment included in the consolidated
	statements of comprehensive income (loss).


	Depreciation and amortization are
	provided for financial reporting purposes primarily on the straight-line method
	over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS


	Cash equivalents consist of highly
	liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash generally with
	maturities of three months or less when purchased.


	INVENTORY


	Prior to January 1, 2015, inventories
	are stated at the lower of cost or replacement cost with respect to raw
	materials and the lower of cost or market with respect to finished goods and
	work in progress. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
	Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11 (ASU 2015-11), Simplifying the
	Measurement of Inventory, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2015.
	Subsequent to January 1, 2015, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
	replacement cost with respect to raw materials and the lower of cost or net
	realizable value with respect to finished goods and work in progress. The cost
	of work in progress and finished goods is determined on a weighted average cost
	basis and includes direct material, direct labor and overhead costs. Net
	realizable value represents the anticipated selling price, net of distribution
	cost, less estimated costs to completion for work in progress.


	Inventories as of June 30, 2016 were
	$350,071 and $359,194 in December 31, 2015.


	INCOME TAXES


	Income tax expense is based on reported
	income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of
	temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for
	financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax
	purposes. In accordance with ASC Topic 740 (formerly SFAS No. 109, Accounting
	for income taxes) these deferred taxes are measured by applying currently
	enacted tax laws.


	The Company did not provide any current
	or deferred income tax provision or benefit for any period presented to date
	because it has experienced operating losses since inception. The benefit of any
	tax income (loss) carry forwards is fully offset by a valuation allowance, as
	there is a more than fifty percent chance that the Company will not realize
	those benefits.


	There are net operating loss carry
	forwards allowed under the Hong Kong and China Governments tax system.


	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS


	Company sponsored research and
	development costs, related to both present and future products, are charged to
	operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses. Expenditures
	for research and development for the six months period ended June 30, 2016 and
	2015 were both $0 and a cumulative amount of $8,880,206 for the period from June
	4, 1997 (inception) to June 30, 2016.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	SHIPPING AND HANDLING


	Costs relating to shipping and handling
	are part of general and administrative expenses in the unaudited consolidated
	statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Insignificant amount of
	shipping and handling costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016
	and 2015.


	EARNING (LOSS) PER SHARE


	Basic earnings (loss) per common share
	("LPS") is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss)
	per common share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding
	shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options.


	There were no stock options and
	potentially dilutive securities outstanding as at June 30, 2016.


	STOCK - BASED COMPENSATION


	Compensation expense for costs related
	to all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, is recognized
	through a fair-value based method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
	option-pricing model to determine the grant date fair value for stock options.
	The Company uses the grant date stock price to determine the grant date fair
	value of restricted shares. The Company has elected to recognize share-based
	compensation costs using the straight-line method over the requisite service
	period with a graded vesting schedule, provided that the amount of compensation
	costs recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant date
	value of the awards that are vested at that date. Forfeitures are estimated at
	the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Share based compensation costs are
	recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for
	those awards that are expected to vest.


	The Company had no such compensation
	expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.


	COMPARATIVE FIGURES


	Certain comparative figures have been
	reclassified in order to conform with the presentation adopted in the current
	period.


	COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)


	The Companys comprehensive income
	(loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation
	adjustments.


	RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS


	There were no changes to the new
	accounting pronouncements as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 except for the following:

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	In February 2016, the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance which amends the existing
	accounting standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the
	recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising
	from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the
	new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and
	lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for us
	from November 1, 2020, and interim periods in the following year. Early adoption
	of this guidance is permitted and we will be required to adopt using a modified
	retrospective approach. We are evaluating the timing and the impact of adopting
	this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.


	In January 2016, FASB issued amendments
	to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and
	disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires entities to measure
	equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for
	under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in
	net income. The provisions under this amendment are effective for us from
	November 1, 2018, and for interim periods in the following year and early
	adoption is not permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this
	guidance to our consolidated financial statements.


	In November 2015, FASB issued guidance
	intended to simplify accounting for deferred taxes. Beginning on November 1,
	2017 and including the interim periods following that date, we will be required
	to present all deferred tax balances as non-current. Existing GAAP guidance
	requires us to record deferred tax balances as either current or non-current in
	accordance with the classification of the underlying attributes. Early adoption
	of this guidance is permitted and may be applied either prospectively or
	retrospectively to all periods presented. We expect to early adopt this guidance
	prospectively at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, but we are
	still evaluating how significant the impact of the adoption will be on our
	consolidated balance sheet.


	Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S.
	that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not
	require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact
	on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

	INVESTMENT





	On January 5, 2010, the Company
	invested in Cangshan Duoha Vegetable Food Company (Duoha) with 50,000 shares
	of the Companys common stock worth $10,000 as $0.2 per share to acquire 20%
	equity interest in of Duoha. According to the investment agreement, although we
	own 20% equity of Duoha, we do not have significant influence over Duohas
	operating and financing policies. Therefore, the management of the Company
	implemented the cost method to account above investment.


	In May of 2015, we signed an investment
	agreement with Guizhou Biology Technology Ltd. (Guizhou). According to the
	investment agreement, the Company invested RMB 500,000 to acquire 20% equity
	interest in of Guizhou. Although we own 20% equity of Guizhou, we do not have
	significant influence over Guizhous operating and financing policies. As of
	June 30, 2016, the company has invested RMB 500,000 in Guizhou.


	The amount of investment as of June 30,
	2016 and December 31, 2015 was $85,697 and $87,512, respectively.

	Overview of our Business



	We are a holding company that only operates through our
	indirect Chinese subsidiaries Beijing SOD and Chongqing SOD. Through our Chinese
	subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture and market our SOD products in China. SOD
	is a naturally occurring enzyme which may act as a potent antioxidant defense in
	cells that are exposed to oxygen. Certain research has shown that under certain
	biological conditions, SOD revitalizes cells and reduces the rate of cell
	destruction. It neutralizes the most common free radicalsuperoxide radicalby
	converting it into hydrogen peroxide and water. Because superoxide is harmful to
	human cells, and certain forms of SOD exist naturally in most humans, many
	studies show that SOD is valuable in protecting human cells from the harmful
	effects of superoxide. SOD is thought to be more powerful than antioxidant
	vitamins as it activates the body's productions of its own antioxidants. As a result, SOD is referred to as the enzyme of
	life. Commercially, SOD has a wide range of applications and is widely applied
	in foods, drinks, skin care productions, pharmaceuticals, to combat ailments
	ranging from sunburn to rheumatoid arthritis.

	Highlights




	The following are some financial highlights for the three
	months ended June 30, 2016:






	



	Revenue

	: Revenue increased $618,762 to
	$624,345 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $5,583 for the
	same period in 2015.

	



	Net profit

	: Net profit increased
	$236,427, or 274.40%, to $150,264 for the three months ended June 30,

	



	Fully diluted net income per share

	:
	Fully diluted net loss per share was $0 for the three months ended June
	30, 2016, as compared to $0 for the same period in 2015.

	Holding Limited is subject to United States tax at a tax rate of 34%. No
	provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as China
	Longyi Group International Holding Limited had no income subject to United
	States taxation in the second quarter of 2016.






	 














	 




	





	British Virgin Islands

	: Our wholly owned
	subsidiary Top Team Holdings Limited was incorporated in the British
	Virgin Islands, or the BVI, and, under the current laws of the BVI, is not
	subject to income taxes.





	 


	 


	 

























	





	China

	: Before the implementation of the enterprise
	income tax, or EIT, Foreign Invested Enterprises or FIEs, established in
	the PRC were generally subject to an EIT rate of 33.0%, which includes a
	30.0% state income tax and a 3.0% local income tax. On March 16, 2007, the
	National Peoples Congress of China passed the new Corporate Income Tax
	Law, or EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China
	passed the Implementing Rules for the EIT Law, or Implementing Rules,
	which took effect on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and Implementing Rules
	impose a unified EIT of 25.0% on all domestic- invested enterprises and
	FIEs, unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. Therefore,
	nearly all FIEs are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic
	businesses rather than benefiting from the old tax laws applicable to
	FIEs, and its associated preferential tax treatments, beginning January 1,
	2008.






	 


























































	Despite these pending changes, the EIT Law gives the FIEs
	established before March 16, 2007, or Old FIEs, such as our subsidiaries
	Beijing SOD and Chongqing SOD, a five-year grandfather period during which
	they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatments.
	During this five-year grandfather period, the Old FIEs which enjoyed tax
	rates lower than 25% under the original EIT Law shall gradually increase
	their EIT rate by 2% per year until the tax rate reaches 25%. In addition,
	the Old FIEs that are eligible for the two-year exemption and three-year
	half reduction or five-year exemption and five-year half-reduction
	under the original EIT Law, are allowed to remain to enjoy their
	preference until these holidays expire. The discontinuation of any such
	special or preferential tax treatment or other incentives would have an
	adverse effect on any organizations business, fiscal condition and
	current operations in China.

	In addition to the changes to the
	current tax structure, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of
	China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident
	enterprise and will normally be subject to a EIT of 25.0% on its global income.
	The Implementing Rules define the term de facto management bodies as an
	establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over
	the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.
	If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified
	as a resident enterprise, then our consolidated global income will be subject to
	PRC income tax of 25.0% .


	We incurred no income taxes in either the three months ended
	June 30, 2016 or the three months ended June 30, 2015.

	$242,328 for the same period in 2015. This increase was mainly because we paid
	less professional and financial consultation fees for the six months ended June

	Operating Activities



	Net cash provided by operating activities was $85,564 for the
	six-month period ended June 30, 2016 representing an increase of $22,597 from
	$62,967 of net cash provided by the operating activities for the same period of
	2015. The increase in the cash provided by operating activities was mainly
	attributable to the number of account of Net Loss, Account receivables, Deposits
	and prepayment, and other payables changed. Cash flows provided by Net Loss
	increased $287,940 to $63,370 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from
	($224,570) for the same period in 2015. Cash flow used in Account receivables
	decreased $9,739, to $3,751 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $13,490
	for the same period in 2015. Cash flows used in Deposits and prepayment
	increased $27,132, to $27,132 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $0
	for the same period in 2015. Cash flow provided by other payables decreased
	$93,599, to $182,800 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $276,399 for
	the same period in 2015.



	Investing Activities



	Net cash provided by investing activities for the six-month
	period ended June 30, 2016 was $0 as compared with $66,137 of net cash used in
	investing activities for the same period of 2015. Such change was mainly because
	we didnt have any investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016
	compared with the same period of 2015.



	Financing Activities



	Net cash provided by financing activities for the six-month
	period ended June 30, 2016 was $(42,525) as compared to $(1,632) used in
	financing activities for the same period in 2015. We repaid certain short term
	loans and loans from directors in an amount of $30,624 and $11,901,
	respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016.


	The Company did not have any bank loans as of June 30, 2016.




	We expect to generate approximately $1 million to $1.5 million
	of revenues from the sale of our products during the next 12 months. If our cash
	on hand and cash flow from operations do not meet our expected capital
	expenditure and working capital requirements for the next 12 months, we expect
	that our directors will provide more cash as loans to the company. However, we may in the future require additional
	cash resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our
	strategy to expand our production capacity or other investments or acquisitions
	we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are insufficient to
	satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt
	securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity
	securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of
	indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could
	require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our
	operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to
	us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to
	us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and
	could harm our overall business prospects.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	Economic and Political Risks


	The Company faces a number of risks and challenges as a result
	of having primary operations and marketing in the PRC. Changing political
	climates in the PRC could have a significant effect on the Companys business.




	Foreign Currencies


	The company has determined that RMB to be its functional
	currency. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements are
	presented in U.S. dollars. The audited consolidated financial statements are
	translated into US dollars from RMB at year-end exchange rates for assets and
	liabilities, and weighted average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.
	Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the
	capital transactions occurred.

	Use of Estimates


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.


	Significant Estimates


	Several areas require significant management estimates relating
	to uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible that there will be a
	material change in the near term. The more significant areas requiring the use
	of management estimates related to determination of net realizable value of
	inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, property and equipment, accrued
	liabilities and, the useful lives for depreciation.


	Restrictions on Transfer of Assets Out of the PRC


	Dividend payments by Beijing SOD are limited by certain
	statutory regulations in the PRC. No dividends may be paid by Beijing SOD
	without first receiving prior approval from the Foreign Currency Exchange
	Management Bureau. Dividend payments are restricted to 85% of profits, after
	tax.


	Revenue Recognition


	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff
	Accounting Bulletin No.104 Revenue recognition (ASC Topic 605). Revenues are recognized as earned when the
	following four criteria are met: (1) a customer issues purchase orders or
	otherwise agrees to purchase products; (2) products are delivered to the
	customer; (3) pricing is fixed or determined in accordance with the purchase
	order or agreement; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.

	Inflation



	Inflation does not materially affect our business or the
	results of our operations.



	Seasonality



	We may experience seasonal variations in our future revenues
	and our operating costs, however, we do not believe that these variations will
	be material.



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
	are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
	operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
	material to investors.

	be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this report, that it files or
	submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
	within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure
	controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
	reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
	communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and
	principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
	required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
	matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
	achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
	evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
	Based on that evaluation, Ms. Jie Chen and Mr. Xinmin Pan concluded that as of
	June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
	reasonable assurance level.
