Our condensed unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
(US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in
this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking

Company History



Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 25, 2012 under
the name Cold Cam, Inc. and originally intended to develop a camera system to be
placed on the inside of refrigerator doors.
On January 31, 2015, Yonekatsu Kato, formerly our company's sole officer and
director, entered into a stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which he sold all
of his 10,000,000 shares of our company's common stock (98% of our company's
total outstanding common shares) to Magicstem Development Limited, a Seychelles
corporation ("Magicstem Development") ultimately owned by Chi Man Ng, in a
private transaction, for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000. The funds used
for this share purchase were Magicstem Development's funds. Magicstem
Development now owns 98% of our company's issued and outstanding shares of
common stock. The closing of the share purchase agreement created a change of
control of our company. As a result of the change of control, and the change in
our management as noted herein, our company now intends to investigate
additional opportunities in an effort to enhance shareholder value. Those
efforts are initially anticipated to focus on the development of stem cell
cryo-preserved banking in Asia, with the expectation that primary customers
would come from China.
On January 31, 2015, our board of directors accepted the resignation of
Yonekatsu Kato as our president, chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, treasurer, secretary and director.
The resignation of Yonekatsu Kato was not the result of any disagreements with
our company regarding our operations, policies, practices or otherwise.

On January 31, 2015, we appointed Chi Man Ng as president, chief executive
officer and director; Ka Sing Edmund Yeung as chief financial officer,
treasurer, secretary and director; and Guosheng Hu as chief technology officer
and director of our company.
On April 1, 2015, our company's board of directors approved an agreement and
plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary Magicstem Group Corp.,
a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Cold Cam, Inc. to Magicstem
Group Corp. Our company remained as the surviving company. Magicstem Group Corp.
was formed on October 25, 2012.
The name change was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) for filing with an effective date of May 4, 2015 and became effective
with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on May 4, 2015 under the symbol
"MGGI".
On July 21, 2015, our company appointed Chun-han (Peter) Lin as a director and
Chun-heng (Kevin) Lin as Group Senior Manager of our company. On April 1, 2016Mr. Chun-heng Lin resigned as group senior manager of our company. On April 1,
2016, we appointed Ms. Kit U Tang as group senior manager of our company.
At this time, we have not developed our product or contacted any possible client
or developer. Our company has not yet implemented its business model and to
date, has generated no revenues.

increase in professional fees.

As at April 30, 2017, we had $4,675 in cash, and liabilities of $120,767
compared to $85,552 cash and $247,586 in liabilities as at October 31, 2016. The
increase in our working capital deficiency arose due to an increase in repayment
to related parties.
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
During the six months ended April 30, 2017, we used $96,527 in our operating
activities compared to $23,908 used in operating activities during the six
months ended April 30, 2016. During the six months ended April 30, 2017 we
incurred losses of $46,866 and we decreased accounts payable and accrued
expenses by $45,094. By comparison, during the six months ended April 30, 2016
we incurred losses of $20,039 and increased accounts payable and accrued
expenses by $1,131.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
We neither generated funds nor used funds in investing activities during the six
month periods ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
During the six months ended April 30, 2017, we received proceeds of $97,775 from
the issuance of our common stock, compared to receiving a $20,955 loan from a
current officer, during the six months ended April 30, 2016. The increase in
cash flow from financing activities in 2017 reflected our need to fund the
increased cash flow used in operating activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 as
described above.



Going Concern



Our financial statements for the three and six month period ended April 30, 2017
have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
We not generated revenues, have achieved losses since our inception, and rely
upon the sale of our common stock and proceeds from shareholder loans to fund
our operations. If we are unable to raise equity or secure alternative
financing, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business plan
may fail.
If our operations and cash flow improve, management believes that we can
continue to operate. However, no assurance can be given that management's
actions will result in profitable operations or an improvement in our liquidity
situation. The threat of our ability to continue as a going concern will cease
to exist only when our revenues have reached a level able to sustain our
business operations.
Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

Future Financings



If our company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a
private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through
debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage
company to secure. Therefore, our company is highly dependent upon the success
of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result
in our company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing,
which may be available. However, if such financing were available, because we
have no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs
associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate.
At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of
such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations
and growth and manage the debt load. If our company cannot raise additional
proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing we
would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in our
company's common stock would lose all of their investment.
As of the date of this Report, the current funds available to our company will
not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to establish our company and
begin operations is estimated to be approximately $100,000 over the next twelve
months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be
$8,000 over this same period, not taking into account any additional funds that
may be required for the acquisition or commencement of a stem cell banking
business. Our officers and directors have undertaken to provide our company with
operating capital to sustain our business over the next twelve month period as
the expenses are incurred in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is
no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management
believes that if our company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its
reporting status with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") we will
have to cease all efforts directed towards our company. As such, any investment
previously made would be lost in its entirety.



Plan of Operation



As a result of the change of control, and the change in our management as noted
herein, our company now intends to investigate additional opportunities in an
effort to enhance shareholder value. Those efforts are initially anticipated to
focus on the development of stem cell banking cryopreserved in Asia, with the
expectation that primary customers would come from China.
In order to pursue this initiative, we anticipate that our cash requirements for
the next twelve months shall consist of:

Critical Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of our company and
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ("GAAP") and the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation
S-X and are presented in US dollars. Our company has adopted an October 31
fiscal year end.
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.
Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring
entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the
financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been
made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The
results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
operations for a full year.
While management of our company believes that the disclosures presented herein
are adequate and not misleading, these condensed interim financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited combined financial statements and
the footnotes thereto for the year ended October 31, 2016 filed on Form 10-K on
January 30, 2017.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        National Pen Company has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 27 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What is a limited liability company?
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state law that combines characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are generally not personally liable for company debts. Like a sole proprietorship or a partnership, an LLC is, by default, a "pass through" entity for tax purposes. This means that the LLC does not pay taxes on its profits, but instead, profits and losses are "passed through" to the owners, who must then pay tax on their share of LLC income.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


What is the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation. S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business?
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn more.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporation FAQ
Find FAQs related to forming a corporation.
















What are the main differences between a C corporation and an S corporation?


C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, one tax at the corporate level on the corporation's net income, and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed. S corporations have only one level of taxation. All of their income is allocated to the shareholders.
However, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability. In addition, S corporations are subject to limitations, such as the number and type of shareholders they can have.
LegalZoom will help you start a C corporation or an S corporation. Get started by answering a few questions about your company, and we will file your paperwork with the Secretary of State.



 





How do I choose a corporate name?


In general, the name of a corporation must end with "incorporated,"
            "corporation" or an abbreviation of one of these. A name will not be accepted
            if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name
            of another corporation already formed in that state. Many states also
            restrict the use of certain terms in a corporation's name (like bank, police
            or insurance).
LegalZoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names, in order of
            preference. We will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are
            available. Please note that for government purposes the names "ABC, Inc." and
            "A.B.C., Corp." are identical. Therefore, you should disregard spaces, periods
            and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name
            choices.
If the name of your corporation will be used in connection with
            goods or services, you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark
            protection for the name. This helps ensure that no one else in the U.S. may use
            that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services
            (except in areas where someone else is already using that
            name).



 





Is a corporation required to have a registered agent?


Each corporation must have a registered agent  (some states use the term "resident agent" 
            or "statutory agent," but the concept is the same). This is the person
            designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the
            corporation is served with a lawsuit. Most states require that the registered agent must be
            either:

(1) an adult living in the state of formation with a street
              address (P.O. boxes are not acceptable) or
(2) a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation
              that provides registered agent services.

One of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is
            that any officer or director (of a corporation) or manager or member (of an LLC) can act as the registered agent. However, there
            are some advantages to having another person or company act as your
            registered agent. First, this adds an extra layer of privacy, since the
            registered agent's name and address are publicly available. Second, this
            helps limit the risk that if your corporation or LLC is named as a defendant in a lawsuit, no one will surprise
            you at home on a Sunday night with court papers.



 





How much will it cost to form and run a corporation?


Each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation. In many
            states, you must also submit an "annual report" or "list of directors and
            officers," which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have
            state taxes.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Delaware?


The advantages of incorporating in Delaware according to the Delaware Secretary of State: 
More than half a million business entities have their legal home in Delaware. This includes more than half of all U.S. publicly-traded and Fortune 500 companies. Businesses choose Delaware for its complete incorporation services package, which includes modern and flexible corporate laws, the highly-respected Delaware Courts, a business-friendly state government and the customer service oriented staff of the Delaware Division of Corporations. 



 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


An LLC has more operating flexibility and fewer
            corporate formalities than an S corporation. For example, an S corporation
            cannot have more than 100 stockholders and must hold both periodic director's
            meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders. However, owners of an S
            corporation may be subject to fewer taxes than LLC owners.
            For more information, please see "Differences
            Between a Corporation and a Limited Liability Company (LLC)" from the main
            guide.


 





Do I need an attorney to form a corporation?


No, you do not need an attorney to form a corporation. You can
            prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a legal
            documentation service such as LegalZoom.
To learn more and speak with a representative, please call us at
            (888) 381-8758.



 





What is the procedure for forming a corporation, and what legal documents are required?


To create a corporation, you must file a document called the "articles of incorporation" 
            with the Secretary of State or other appropriate state agency. Next,
            bylaws and organizing resolutions must be adopted. A corporation will also
            need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS.
Unlike many other incorporation services which only
            create and file the articles of incorporation, LegalZoom can 
            complete all of these required documents for you, including personalized bylaws
            and organizational resolutions.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Nevada?


According to the Nevada Secretary of State, the following details the advantages of incorporating in Nevada: 

No corporate income tax 

No taxes on corporate shares 
No franchise tax 
No personal income tax 
No I.R.S. information sharing agreement 
Nominal annual fees 
Minimal reporting and disclosure requirements 
Stockholders are not on public record 



 





What are the naming conventions for professional corporations?


Have you ever noticed the initials "P.C." or "P.A." after a company's
            name? These initials indicate the company is a professional corporation ("P.C.") 
            or a professional association ("P.A."). State law dictates what is required in the 
            name, and those requirements differ by state.



 





What is a professional corporation?


Professional corporations (PC) are corporations that provide
            professional services. State law and the regulating board determine what
            constitutes professional services and when you are required to be a
            professional corporation. This varies from state to
            state.



 





Can I be the only shareholder in my corporation?


Yes, a corporation can be formed with only one shareholder.
            However, corporate formalities, such as director and shareholder meetings,
            are still required in order to preserve the corporate form and prevent the
            shareholder from personal liability.



 





What is a corporation?



            A corporation is a distinct legal entity created under state laws which can
            open a bank account, purchase property, enter into contracts and operate a
            business. One of the most important features of a corporation is that,
            generally, its owners are not personally liable for the debts of the
            corporation.


 





When is a corporation considered a professional corporation?


The definition of "professionals" can vary from state to state, but typically includes professions that require a license, such as doctors, chiropractors, lawyers, dentists, accountants, architects or engineers. Depending on the state where you incorporate, the following activities may be classified as professional services. 
Accounting and financial services 
Architectural services
Legal services
Medical services



 





Where should I incorporate?


A corporation can incorporate in any of the 50 states, plus the
            District of Columbia. Many people choose to incorporate in their home
            state, which can save money in filing fees. That is because corporations are
            required to register in each state where they do business. For example, a
            Delaware corporation that has its main business office in Arkansas must
            register as a "foreign corporation" with the Arkansas Secretary of
            State and must pay applicable fees and taxes to both Delaware and Arkansas. Delaware is popular
            because of its history, experience and pro-business climate. Nevada is also
            popular because of its pro-business environment and lack of a formal
            information-sharing agreement with the IRS. Please read the next two FAQs for
            more specifics on each state.



 





Who can form a corporation?


Generally, anyone who completes the articles of incorporation and pays the
            state filing fee can form a corporation. There are usually no residency or
            other legal requirements. However, many states require that an individual forming 
            a corporation must be at least 18 years old.
