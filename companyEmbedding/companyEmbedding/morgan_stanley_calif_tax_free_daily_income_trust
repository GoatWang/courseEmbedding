            From the first day I talked to Jay about my case until the day my case was settled, he made me feel like he truly cared about me as a person, not just a client. I highly recommend Morgan & Morgan to anyone in need. And, I will never be able to thank them enough for what they did for me!

            Mary Anne Laforme was a true blessing. We were in an accident and she was so kind when helping us with any questions or concerns. Very considerate and up front about everything in our situation. If we have any other issues, we will definitely be calling them. Thanks for everything, Mary Anne.

What You Should Know About Personal Injury

Personal Injury Lawsuits



Personal Injury Lawsuits







No one likes to get injured — it often means dealing with lengthy periods of pain and a pile of medical bills. But when it’s not even your fault, that can be worse. You’re left dealing with physical, emotional, and financial pain that someone else caused. Luckily, the legal system is fine-tuned to address this scenario. This is called “personal injury law.”
What is Personal Injury?
Personal injury law is a very specific type of civil law. A private individual plaintiff can file a lawsuit against someone they accuse of wrongful conduct that contributed to their injury. Personal injury attorneys in these cases will go to great lengths to advocate for their clients. This can include investigating the scene of the accident, questioning witnesses, working with medical experts, and sometimes even working with experts that can help reconstruct the accident, among other things.
Why File A Personal Injury Lawsuit?
An injury may not seem like grounds for a lawsuit at first, but it can cause lasting physical and emotional damage, leading to long-time pain and financial strain. If someone else caused a severe or lingering injury, you may be able to file a personal injury suit and gain compensation for your damages. Whether someone else can be held be responsible is key to determining if you have a lawsuit on your hands. With enough evidence that another party’s negligence caused your injury, you may be able to reach a settlement or take your case to trial.
At Morgan & Morgan, we have more than 300 lawyers nationwide with vast experience in various types of personal injury law and a reputation for helping people receive the compensation they need. Our attorneys have years of experience taking cases to trial, where we have been able to recover many times the amount of an insurance company’s initial settlement offer.
What Type of Personal Injury Lawsuits Do People File?
Here are some of the forms of personal injury lawsuits we have worked on, and the ways these injuries and lawsuits come about.
Motor Vehicle Accidents
Vehicles all bring with them a unique risk of injury, and a number of different types of lawsuits. The majority of these accidents are car accidents, but can also include motorcycle, trucking, and even boating accidents. Often, these personal injury claims stem from the negligence of another driver. From texting while driving and driving under the influence, these acts and more can cause lifelong damage to someone. Even lesser accidents can require long-term medical care. These lawsuits are often brought to get compensation for medical bills and future medical expenses, such as rehabilitation. There are also damages potentially available for lost time at work, and the physical and emotional suffering endured.
Premises Liability/Slip and Fall
Those who have slipped and fallen on someone’s property may find themselves with an injury that could have been avoided had the property owner acted more carefully in maintaining their property. This type of fall can cause an injury that lingers, resulting in lengthy, costly medical bills. Slip and fall lawsuits can be a lot of work at times, but if you have the evidence to show negligence, the owner of a restaurant, store, or other establishment may be held liable for your damages.
Construction Injuries
Construction jobs are inherently risky, and construction sites are home to many on-the-job injuries. And as such, many construction accident injury claims can also fall into other categories.
Dog Bites
Dog bites and attacks can be far more serious than they sound. Those who have been bitten by someone else’s pet can, if it’s determined that the victim was not provoking the dog, potentially file a lawsuit against the owner and their homeowners’ insurance (should it apply) and be entitled to compensation for their medical expenses and emotional distress.
Birth Injuries
Birth injuries are among the most dangerous forms of medical malpractice. A negligent mistake by an obstetrician can result in physical injuries to a newborn, and it can also lead to lasting disorders, such as cerebral palsy, paralysis, and brain damage. This can be traumatic to the children and the parents, as well as a major financial strain on the family. A personal injury lawsuit for a family dealing with an injury to their newborn during birth gives the family the potential to recover compensation for these tangible and intangible damages.
Brain & Spinal Cord Injuries
The most alarming types of injuries that can stem from car accidents, medical malpractice, and more are ones to the brain or to the spinal cord. In personal injury cases involving these specific injuries, there is potentially permanent physical and/or mental damage to the victim. As a result, a lot of work goes into proving there was negligence and a breach of care by the other party, because the potential compensation the victim and his or her family can get is much higher, as it would be for long-term medical expenses.
Burn Injuries
Burn injuries are some of the most dangerous injuries one can be inflicted with, as negligence can cause fiery motor vehicle accidents, faulty electrical wiring, scalding water, and more. These can cause horrific burns. There are different degrees of burns; some heal quickly. Others can lead to lifelong scarring and trauma. As such, compensation received in a burn injury lawsuit is often awarded for long-term medical expenses, as well as for pain and suffering.
Wrongful Death
Personal injury cases that have resulted in a fatality fall into the category of wrongful death. In addition to the usual medical bills and expenses one can attain in a personal injury lawsuit through compensation, the victim’s family can potentially be compensated for the costs of the funeral. Families could also be eligible to receive other damages.
For example, if the victim was the primary source of income, a spouse or family could possibly receive compensation for their sudden lost income. Compensation is also available for the pain and suffering, as well as the loss of companionship. These damages can help the family obtain some peace of mind after a sudden loss.
How We May be Able to Help
The ways that another person’s negligence can injure you are larger in number than you may have thought, and more severe. But there are options for you in the aftermath of your injury. Morgan & Morgan’s personal injury attorneys may be able to help you through these difficult times. Contact your local office for a free, no-obligation case evaluation form.

On June 24, 2016, the Class of the California Tax-Free Daily Income Trust was redesignated as the "R Class."
On June 28, 2016, the California Tax-Free Daily Income Trust launched Class S shares.
Income dividend distributions are normally exempt from federal and California state income taxes to the extent they are derived from California municipal obligations. Income derived from other portfolio securities may be subject to federal, state and/or local income taxes. Income derived from some municipal securities is subject to the federal “alternative minimum tax.” If the Fund makes any capital gain distributions, or other distributions from any taxable income, those distributions will normally be subject to federal and state income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in Fund shares. Investors should consult their tax adviser for further information on tax implications. 
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the Fund's current prospectus.
Subject to change daily. Portfolio information and composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security. 
DEFINITIONS 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the dollar value of a single mutual fund share, based on the value of the underlying assets of the fund minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is calculated at the end of each business day. Subsidized(Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect. Current yield is a measure that looks at the current price of a bond instead of its face value and represents the return an investor would expect if he or she purchased the bond and held it for a year. Calculated by dividing the Annual Cash Inflows / Market Price. The 7-day effective yields are annualized net yields that describe 1-year earnings assuming dividends are reinvested at the average rate of the last 7 days. SEC 30-day yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield - Un-Subsidized (Un-Sub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Weighted average maturity (WAM). Maturity measures the number of days remaining in the life of a bond. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio's individual holdings. Weighted average life (WAL). A measure of sensitivity to liquidity and/or credit risk. Weighted average life takes into account all call options exercised by the issuer as well as permissible maturity shortening devices such as demand features.
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.  The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Funds’ sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(8) (defining “daily liquid asset” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day).
2 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(32) (defining “weekly liquid assets” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days).
As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolios carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the portfolios. To obtain a prospectus, download one at www.morganstanley.com/liquidity or call 1.800.236.0992. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

On June 24, 2016, the Class of the Tax-Free Daily Income Trust was redesignated as the "R Class."
On June 28, 2016, the Tax-Free Daily Income Trust launched Class S shares.
Your income dividend distributions are normally exempt from federal tax to the extent they are derived from municipal obligations. Income derived from other portfolio securities may be subject to federal, state and/or local income taxes. Income derived from some municipal securities is subject to the federal “alternative minimum tax.” If the Fund makes any capital gain distributions, those distributions will normally be subject to federal and state income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in Fund shares.  Investors should consult their tax adviser for further information on tax implications.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the Fund's current prospectus.
Subject to change daily. Portfolio information and composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security.
DEFINITIONS 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the dollar value of a single mutual fund share, based on the value of the underlying assets of the fund minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is calculated at the end of each business day. Subsidized(Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect. Current yield is a measure that looks at the current price of a bond instead of its face value and represents the return an investor would expect if he or she purchased the bond and held it for a year. Calculated by dividing the Annual Cash Inflows / Market Price. The 7-day effective yields are annualized net yields that describe 1-year earnings assuming dividends are reinvested at the average rate of the last 7 days. SEC 30-day yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield - Un-Subsidized (Un-Sub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Weighted average maturity (WAM). Maturity measures the number of days remaining in the life of a bond. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio's individual holdings. Weighted average life (WAL). A measure of sensitivity to liquidity and/or credit risk. Weighted average life takes into account all call options exercised by the issuer as well as permissible maturity shortening devices such as demand features.
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.  The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Funds’ sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(8) (defining “daily liquid asset” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day).
2 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(32) (defining “weekly liquid assets” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days).
As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolios carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the portfolios. To obtain a prospectus, download one at www.morganstanley.com/liquidity or call 1.800.236.0992. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Three ways Draghi could burn the euro bulls
              
              The euro has been getting stronger, but investors should remember that central banker Mario Draghi could act quickly to weaken the currency, writes Matthew Lynn.

Personal Injury Lawsuits



Personal Injury Lawsuits







No one likes to get injured — it often means dealing with lengthy periods of pain and a pile of medical bills. But when it’s not even your fault, that can be worse. You’re left dealing with physical, emotional, and financial pain that someone else caused. Luckily, the legal system is fine-tuned to address this scenario. This is called “personal injury law.”
What is Personal Injury?
Personal injury law is a very specific type of civil law. A private individual plaintiff can file a lawsuit against someone they accuse of wrongful conduct that contributed to their injury. Personal injury attorneys in these cases will go to great lengths to advocate for their clients. This can include investigating the scene of the accident, questioning witnesses, working with medical experts, and sometimes even working with experts that can help reconstruct the accident, among other things.
Why File A Personal Injury Lawsuit?
An injury may not seem like grounds for a lawsuit at first, but it can cause lasting physical and emotional damage, leading to long-time pain and financial strain. If someone else caused a severe or lingering injury, you may be able to file a personal injury suit and gain compensation for your damages. Whether someone else can be held be responsible is key to determining if you have a lawsuit on your hands. With enough evidence that another party’s negligence caused your injury, you may be able to reach a settlement or take your case to trial.
At Morgan & Morgan, we have more than 300 lawyers nationwide with vast experience in various types of personal injury law and a reputation for helping people receive the compensation they need. Our attorneys have years of experience taking cases to trial, where we have been able to recover many times the amount of an insurance company’s initial settlement offer.
What Type of Personal Injury Lawsuits Do People File?
Here are some of the forms of personal injury lawsuits we have worked on, and the ways these injuries and lawsuits come about.
Motor Vehicle Accidents
Vehicles all bring with them a unique risk of injury, and a number of different types of lawsuits. The majority of these accidents are car accidents, but can also include motorcycle, trucking, and even boating accidents. Often, these personal injury claims stem from the negligence of another driver. From texting while driving and driving under the influence, these acts and more can cause lifelong damage to someone. Even lesser accidents can require long-term medical care. These lawsuits are often brought to get compensation for medical bills and future medical expenses, such as rehabilitation. There are also damages potentially available for lost time at work, and the physical and emotional suffering endured.
Premises Liability/Slip and Fall
Those who have slipped and fallen on someone’s property may find themselves with an injury that could have been avoided had the property owner acted more carefully in maintaining their property. This type of fall can cause an injury that lingers, resulting in lengthy, costly medical bills. Slip and fall lawsuits can be a lot of work at times, but if you have the evidence to show negligence, the owner of a restaurant, store, or other establishment may be held liable for your damages.
Construction Injuries
Construction jobs are inherently risky, and construction sites are home to many on-the-job injuries. And as such, many construction accident injury claims can also fall into other categories.
Dog Bites
Dog bites and attacks can be far more serious than they sound. Those who have been bitten by someone else’s pet can, if it’s determined that the victim was not provoking the dog, potentially file a lawsuit against the owner and their homeowners’ insurance (should it apply) and be entitled to compensation for their medical expenses and emotional distress.
Birth Injuries
Birth injuries are among the most dangerous forms of medical malpractice. A negligent mistake by an obstetrician can result in physical injuries to a newborn, and it can also lead to lasting disorders, such as cerebral palsy, paralysis, and brain damage. This can be traumatic to the children and the parents, as well as a major financial strain on the family. A personal injury lawsuit for a family dealing with an injury to their newborn during birth gives the family the potential to recover compensation for these tangible and intangible damages.
Brain & Spinal Cord Injuries
The most alarming types of injuries that can stem from car accidents, medical malpractice, and more are ones to the brain or to the spinal cord. In personal injury cases involving these specific injuries, there is potentially permanent physical and/or mental damage to the victim. As a result, a lot of work goes into proving there was negligence and a breach of care by the other party, because the potential compensation the victim and his or her family can get is much higher, as it would be for long-term medical expenses.
Burn Injuries
Burn injuries are some of the most dangerous injuries one can be inflicted with, as negligence can cause fiery motor vehicle accidents, faulty electrical wiring, scalding water, and more. These can cause horrific burns. There are different degrees of burns; some heal quickly. Others can lead to lifelong scarring and trauma. As such, compensation received in a burn injury lawsuit is often awarded for long-term medical expenses, as well as for pain and suffering.
Wrongful Death
Personal injury cases that have resulted in a fatality fall into the category of wrongful death. In addition to the usual medical bills and expenses one can attain in a personal injury lawsuit through compensation, the victim’s family can potentially be compensated for the costs of the funeral. Families could also be eligible to receive other damages.
For example, if the victim was the primary source of income, a spouse or family could possibly receive compensation for their sudden lost income. Compensation is also available for the pain and suffering, as well as the loss of companionship. These damages can help the family obtain some peace of mind after a sudden loss.
