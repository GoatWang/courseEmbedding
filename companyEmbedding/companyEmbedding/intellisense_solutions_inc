About us

 Our company is focused on the development
            of portals to allow companies and individuals
            to engage in the purchase and sales of products over the internet.
            We are focusing on three markets:
            

            1. The vegetarian food market and its variants

            2. The Kosher food market

            3. The Halal food market

            We are initially focusing on the vegetarian market as we see this as
            a rapidly growing market with little or no competition present for a
            service like ours. We are developing a series of certifications for
            different types of vegetarian food (such as Ovo-lacto, Lacto, Ovo,
            Vegan, etc.) and train a number of organizations or individuals who
            are authorized to issue such certificates. We will charge such
            organizations and individuals a one time and yearly fees.
          
Our portals will allow registered producers to advertise their
            products for a small fee. Prospective buyers (most likely
            distributors or retailers) are able to browse our web site for
            vegetarian products, register and communicate with the vendor and
            further enquire about the products. Producers may highlight their
            products to the customers by becoming certified (by us) as producers
            of authentic vegetarian products. A Certified producer is able to
            include our certificates on their products. Another method of
            highlighting their products is by paying us a fee to insure that
            their products are displayed in a distinctive manner and ahead of
            non-paid postings.

He received his Masters and Bachelor of agricultural engineering
            from the University of Damascus, Syria in the years 1974 and 1978
            respectively. After his graduation he joined the Ministry of

About us

Welcome to Intellisense Solutions. Our web portal is the easiest way
          for you to buy and sell specialty food and products through the
          internet. We connect individuals and companies who want to buy and
          sell the different variants of products through our website and our
          proprietary associated software. Buyers can conveniently browse
          through our web portal, and directly connect to a seller before buying
          the product. 
 
There is inconsistency in the current market concerning a
          legitimate form of trust-based qualification system based on the
          ingredients used in food products. 
 
Trust is also a major issue with
          regard to specific market. Most vegetarians, and other niche-cuisine
          communities, are intuitively suspicious of unknown substances in their
          food. This limits them to buy within a small selection of food which
          they are sure fit their eating customs. The same is true for other
          communities such as Muslims who buy Halal products and Jews who buy
          Kosher products. To overcome the lack of Trust, we plan to certify
          different products.

---

Our cash balance is $19,980 as of March 31, 2013, and as of June 27, 2013. We do
not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of
operations beyond one year’s time.                                                
 
Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion.
This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay
our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are
anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no
assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are
attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to
raise enough money through this offering to expand operations but we cannot
guarantee that once we expand operations we will stay in business after doing
so.
 
If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend
operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we
raise $65,033 from this offering, it will last one year, but we may need more
funds to develop growth strategy, and we will have to revert to obtaining
additional money.
 
In the next twelve months, following completion of our public offering, we plan
to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations:
 
                                              25% of           50% of           75% of          100% of

operation. Putting an information-only web site as soon as possible will help to
create brand name recognition. We will also register youtube.com, facebook.com
and twitter.com accounts and link them to our web site. This will also improve
our ranking in many search engines as well as build an audience for our
anticipated launch.
 
If 25% of the shares are sold, we are only able to maintain the company but will

Plaza Network, Inc. (www.ecplaza.net/): EC Plaza Network, Inc is global
B2B e-Market Place for exporters and importers. The company is based in Seoul,
South Korea. While it lists vegetarian products, these are incidental and
constitute a minute part of their product listing. As well, this web site
primarily target South Koreans manufacturers and exporters.
 
Global Sources Ltd. (www.globalsources.com): According to their web site
“Global Sources is a leading business-to-business media company and a primary
facilitator of trade with Greater China. The core business uses English-language
media to facilitate trade from Greater China to the world. The other business
segment utilizes Chinese-language media to enable companies to sell to, and
within Greater China.” The company’s business address is listed in New York,
USA. While it lists vegetarian products, these are incidental and constitute a
minute part of their product listing. As well, this web site primarily target
Chinese manufacturers and exporters.
 
Alibaba.com Hong Kong Limited (www.alibaba.com/): Alibaba.com is perhaps
the best known business-to-business web site and aims at connecting Chinese
exporters to importers in the rest of the word. While it lists vegetarian
products, these are incidental and constitute a minute part of their product
listing. As well, this web site primarily target Chinese manufacturers and
exporters.
 
None of the businesses listed above focus on vegetarian food and simply allow
companies to list their products without apparent review to the claims that the
products meet the different classification of vegetarianism.
 
With our solution, we intend to:
 
. Focus exclusively on vegetarian products;

. Vegetarian products will have to be placed in their appropriate 
  classification;

. We will establish certificates for different classifications of Vegetarian 
  food (such as Ovo-lacto vegetarianism, Lacto vegetarianism, Vegan, etc.) and 
  will have authorized organizations or individuals to issue these 
  certifications;    

. We plan to build a truly global business e-market. Naturally, we expect that
  India as the largest vegetarian market in the world will receive more
  attention from our company as a source of vegetarian products.


Company Description
We are a development stage company which is in the business of operating a
business where third party sellers can sell their food products through the
Internet via our designed web portals.

Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development
activities, which include:


 (i) formation of the Company; (ii) development of our
business plan; (iii) market research related to vegetarian food commerce, and
(iv) website development.
 
Vegetarianism is the practice of following a plant-based diet including fruits,
vegetables, cereal grains, nuts, and seeds, mushrooms, with or without dairy
products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat meat, including red meat, game,
poultry, fish, crustacea, and shellfish, and may also abstain from by-products
of animal slaughter such as animal-derived rennet, found in some cheeses, and
gelatin. Vegetarianism may be adopted for ethical, health, environmental,
religious, political, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or other reasons, and there
are a number of vegetarian diets.
 
Vegetarians may consume these or other unfamiliar animal ingredients
unknowingly, however. This presents a problem to many vegetarians who are not
sure what to eat which limit their selection of products. As well, in the west,
the number of vegetarians is a very small percentage of the population and
therefore it is difficult for supermarkets and distributors to source reliable
sources of vegetarian products. The above mentioned issues also apply to other
niche cuisines such as Halal and Kosher food products for Muslims and Jews
respectively. While we plan to attack the Halal and Kosher food market in the
longer term, we plan to focus on the Vegetarian food market in the first two
years.
 
Our company will focus on the development of portals to allow companies and
individuals to engage in the purchase and sales of products over the internet.
We will focus on three markets where we find a need for such services:
 
1. The vegetarian food market and its variants

2. The Kosher food market

3. The Halal food market

We have registered domain names to target these specific market such
veganemarket.com, vegiemarket.net, halalemarket.com and kosheremarket.com. We
have also registered our corporate web site at intellisensesolutionsinc.com. We
will initially focus on the vegetarian market as we see this as a rapidly
growing market with little or no competition present for a service like ours. We
will also develop a series of certifications for different types of vegetarian
food (such as Ovo-lacto, Lacto, Ovo, Vegan, etc.) and train a number of
organizations or individuals who are authorized to issue such certificates. We
will charge such organizations and individuals a one time and yearly fees.
 
Our portals will allow registered producers to advertise their products for a
small fee. Prospective buyers (most likely distributors or retailers) are able
to browse our web site for vegetarian products, register and communicate with
the vendor and further enquire about the products. Producers may highlight their
products to the customers by becoming certified (by us) as producers of
authentic vegetarian products. A certified producer is able to include our
certificates on their products. Another method of highlighting their products is
by paying us a fee to insure that their products are displayed in a distinctive
manner and ahead of non-paid postings.

The company plans to start the development of our portal software as soon as we
are able to procure financing. We expect that the development and testing phase
will take eight months to complete. It will take a further fourth months to
launch the vegetarian portal.
 
This business plan outlines our objectives as we seek funding for a maximum of
$65,033.30.
