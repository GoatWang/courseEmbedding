The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Dozen of City restaurants sell excellent West Indian roti
The east Indian - inspired flat breads made with floor and oil and often a layer of spiced split peas - but exotic roti express are in a class by themselves. not only are they fresh, flaky and light but they're lined with fillings like spinach, herbs or flaked codfish, and extra layer of flavor you won't find anywhere else.



Owner Bradley Henry, a Guyanese native who also owns the Exotic Roti Express on Flatlands Ave.,
has been making his special roti professionally since 2002. but the idea came to him decades ago"'in my mom's kitchen,'' he says, when "she was making fish cakes at the same time as the roti"



His mother thought the idea to combine the two silly - ''Just stick to the basics, '' was her advice - but who tasted them didn't.
Henry says he made a spinach version while serving ion the military in California, and was surprised to see that even non - west Indian soldiers ''were fighting over them."



Part of idea, says Henry, was to create a filling, affordable meal.
One large roti at Exotic Roti Express- which shares its storefront with a tiny flower shop run by the building's landlord - is just $1.50. The flatbread is usually sold with a filling curry tofu, chicken, beef or goat ($5 to $7 for a small) or sides like mac and cheese or curried chickpeas.
