					Global Macro 	
									












Variant Perception
Elevation is the exclusive provider of macroeconomic research by Variant Perception.
Background
Variant Perception was founded by a team of market professionals with decades of combined experience within asset management, proprietary trading and the qualitative/quantitative modeling disciplines.  Regular research commentaries provide a high level of value to any firm that is interested in using macroeconomic research to formulate trading strategies, manage assets or aid decision making.
What distinguishes Variant Perception from other research providers?
Leading indicators are used to give leading insights, providing an advanced read on the business cycle and recessions in real time.
Economists are terrible at predicting recessions – 9 out of 10 economists missed the last four recessions. Economists miss recessions because they focus on lagging indicators, rather than the leading indicators we reference.
Independent, highly data-driven and agnostic. Variant Perception is not wedded to any point of view and follows leading indicators even if the consensus disagrees.
Economists also miss recessions because of the vintage data problem; they reference heavily revised data. The data-driven and forward-looking analysis removes any reliance on data that will later be revised, and Variant Perception’s independence allows it to always take the agnostic viewpoint.
Focused only on outliers and good trade ideas; the blow-ups and potential success stories.
Wall Street research is produced by rote and is too copious. An economist for France will write about France regardless of the importance or relevance of the content.
A style that is crisp and short, utilizing powerful charts. Time is short, and Variant Perception believes the data tells the most powerful story.
No one likes convoluted research or having to sort through many daily emails to find what is important! Variant Perception keeps reports succinct and lets the data tell the story.
Framework
Variant Perception employs a clear and thoughtful research framework, focusing on market themes, strategies and tactics.
Themes: How is the global economy changing at the highest and most fundamental levels? A broad suite of economic data in addition to proprietary indicators informs analyst views about different economies 6 months to 12 months forward, and longer.
Strategies: What is the best strategy to exploit each theme? What asset or product is the best way to express that theme to deliver the highest risk-adjusted return?
Tactics: Looking at shorter-term factors, such as technicals and positioning, to determine the best time to employ this strategy, consolidate an existing position, or temporarily reduce it until conditions become more favorable again.

Customer Disclosure Statement
Elevation, LLC plans to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption (SBD) and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our company’s business continuity plan (BCP) is designed to permit us to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the SBD.
The BCP addresses: data back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.
Our clearing firms, Merrill Lynch Broadcort and Sterne Agee and Leach, backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by our clearing firm that its objective is to restore its own operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new transactions and payments within 4 to 12 hours. Your orders and requests for funds and securities could be delayed during this period.
Significant Business Disruptions: The Company’s plan takes into account two kinds Significant Business Disruptions, internal and external. Internal SBDs affect only the Company’s ability to communicate and do business, such as a fire or loss of electrical power in the office or building.
External SBDs prevent the operation of the securities markets or a number of firms, such as a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or another event that causes a wide-scale, regional disruption in essential services.
Internal SBDs: In the event of a disruption in the Company’s business operations due to an internal SBD, the Company will attempt to continue to conduct business as usual by utilizing alternative communication methods (if available), such as the Internet, cell phones, etc., or by moving its operations to an alternative location.
If personnel or operations must be moved to an alternate location, the Company anticipates that it will resume regular operations with 4 to 12 hours.
External SBDs: In the event of a disruption in the Company’s business operations due to an external SBD, the Company will attempt to continue to conduct business as usual by moving its operations to an alternative location outside the affected area, if possible, or by providing customers with alternative communication arrangements, as indicated below, to conduct business or to access their funds and securities.
The Company will attempt to resume business within 24-48 hours and to keep its customers informed regarding relevant events to the best of its ability based on the circumstances.
In all cases, the Company will resume normal business operations as soon as it is able to do so, based on the type and the extent of the disrupting event.
If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customer’s prompt access to their funds and securities.
