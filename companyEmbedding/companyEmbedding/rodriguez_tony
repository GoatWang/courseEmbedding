Story 1The Broward County Attorney’s Office provides a full range of legal services to the government of Florida’s second-largest county. From drafting legislation and contracts to defending the County in the state and federal courts, the Office of the County Attorney has the rare privilege of representing its government clients from the beginning of a transaction all the way through litigation and appeals.
The Office of the County Attorney is created by the Broward County Charter. County Attorney Joni Armstrong Coffey was appointed by the Broward County Commission in March 2011. Andrew J. (“Drew”) Meyers serves as Chief Deputy County Attorney.
Our Clients
The Office’s clients include the Broward County Board of County Commissioners, Office of the County Administrator, and all agencies under their oversight. These agencies include such diverse operations as a regional transit system, a major international airport, a busy seaport, a drug rehabilitation center, a convention center, sports and cultural venues, social services, water and sewer systems, a regional solid-waste disposal system, and extensive networks of parks and libraries. 
Other client agencies regulate pollution, plan for urban development, protect consumers, build and maintain roads, state courthouses and other government buildings, keep traffic signals running, and collect more than $800 million per year in property taxes. Overall, the County administers a budget of about $4 billion with more than 5,000 employees serving more than 1.8 million residents.
Our Attorneys
With such a diverse clientele, the Office’s practice is equally varied. Our attorneys work in fields including commercial and construction transactions and litigation, government finance and real property, employment and labor, personal injury defense, civil rights, bankruptcy, land use and environmental law, appeals, and personal injury defense. 
The Office employs about 40 lawyers with wide-ranging legal skills and backgrounds, enabling the County to handle almost all matters in house. Our attorneys studied at top national and regional law schools, and some served as law clerks for state and federal judges. Some attorneys are leaders in bar organizations or community groups, and others teach at area law schools and in continuing legal education programs.
The Office represents only County government agencies and cannot represent private persons. For information on finding a private attorney, please contact the Broward County Bar Association’s Lawyer Referral Service.

American Estates: Tony Rodriguez Smooth Brandy with Bamboo




Product Number: 004-009-4875


          Tony Rodriguez started making pipes about six or seven years ago after learning some of the craft from Scandinavian legends, but applied what he learned in different ways. This is the first bamboo we've had from the maker, and it is covered in a rather thick finish (the bamboo, not the briar) with epoxy in the knuckles - a common technique. No one has heard from him in the last few years and he doesn't seem to be making pipes anymore. This example has a very large stainless steel tenon (3/16" interior) and the stainless steel tenon connecting bamboo to briar is visible inside the bowl. For those of you who collect his work or wish to add a piece, this is a rare chance.

-Adam Davidson
