Historical Growth
Since Plains All American Pipeline's initial public offering in 1998, we have built and acquired a diverse portfolio of strategically located assets and today are one of the largest independent midstream energy companies in North America.


 



Energy in Motion
On average, Plains handles 4.7 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids through our extensive network of assets located in key North American producing basins, major market hubs, and transportation gateways. This plays a vital role in the movement of U.S. and Canadian energy supplies.


 



Financial Vision
A major factor in Plains’ continued success is its ability to maintain a competitive cost of capital and access to capital markets. The company aims to continuously grow its distribution to Unitholders over time through a combination of organic and acquisition-oriented activities.














Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and provides logistics services for crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and refined products. PAA owns an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada.
Plains GP Holdings (NYSE: PAGP) is a publicly traded entity that owns a non-economic controlling interest in the general partner of PAA and an indirect 14% limited partner interest in PAA, one of the largest energy infrastructure and logistics companies in North America.
Both companies are headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Ex-Dividend Reminder: Phillips 66 Partners, Shell Midstream Partners and Plains GP Holdings

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel , on 7/27/17, Phillips 66 Partners LP (Symbol: PSXP), Shell Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: SHLX), and Plains GP Holdings LP (Symbol: PAGP) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Phillips 66 Partners LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.615 on 8/11/17, Shell Midstream Partners LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.291 on 8/14/17, and Plains GP Holdings LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.55 on 8/14/17. As a percentage of PSXP's recent stock price of $50.93, this dividend works out to approximately 1.21%, so look for shares of Phillips 66 Partners LP to trade 1.21% lower - all else being equal - when PSXP shares open for trading on 7/27/17. Similarly, investors should look for SHLX to open 0.98% lower in price and for PAGP to open 1.99% lower, all else being equal.

Below are dividend history charts for PSXP, SHLX, and PAGP, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. 

Phillips 66 Partners LP (Symbol: PSXP) : Shell Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: SHLX) : Plains GP Holdings LP (Symbol: PAGP) : 

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 4.83% for Phillips 66 Partners LP, 3.94% for Shell Midstream Partners LP, and 7.96% for Plains GP Holdings LP. 



In Tuesday trading, Phillips 66 Partners LP shares are currently up about 1%, Shell Midstream Partners LP shares are up about 1.9%, and Plains GP Holdings LP shares are up about 1.2% on the day.

Website

The Enterprise Plaza in Downtown Houston has the headquarters of Enterprise GP Holdings


Enterprise GP Holdings was a midstream energy holding company based in Houston, Texas that made its debut on the Fortune 500 list at #177 in 2007.[1] It had its corporate headquarters in the Enterprise Plaza in Downtown Houston.
The company was led by its president and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph S. Cunningham. Dan Duncan was the majority owner.
Enterprise Products acquired Enterprise GP Holdings in 2010.[2]
History[edit]
In 2005, Ralph S. Cunningham became CEO of the affiliated Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), a transporter of natural gas and crude oil for the next couple of years, before he was instead named president and CEO of Enterprise GP Holdings.[3]
During the second quarter of 2007, Enterprise GP Holdings acquired two major competitors as partners, Houston-based TEPPCO Partners LP (NYSE: TPP) and also 35 percent of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Equity LP (NYSE: ETE).[4]
On July 23, 2007 Ralph S. Cunningham replaced Michael A. Creel as president and CEO of Enterprise GP Holdings LP. Cunningham had earlier that year been named interim president and CEO, and resigned from the Enterprise Products CEO position effective July 31, 2007. Creel then instead became president and CEO of the company's general partner Enterprise Products Partners LP.[3]
Cunningham also became a director of both Enterprise GP Holdings and affiliated Duncan Energy Partners LP (NYSE: EPL).[3]
