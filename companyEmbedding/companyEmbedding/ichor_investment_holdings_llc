Stock To Watch In 2017 - Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (ICHR)


June 26, 2017, 07:00:00 AM EDT
By RTT News

 (RTTNews.com) - We believe this stock is well-positioned for at least 15% upside from current $23 levels. The stock featured on our premium product Short-Term Investor on April 25 at an opening price of $19.5, and on June 9 touched an intra-day high of $29.73, returning a gain of 52.4% to investors. It is now at an attractive price point again.
Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (ICHR) supplies gas panel delivery systems and chemical delivery subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment industry. The semiconductor supply chain depends on critical subsystems, which is Ichor's domain of expertise.
New semiconductor processes, like Multiple Patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and Advanced packaging require more fluid delivery. Ichor says its platforms are critical to etch, Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and deposition steps that support these technology inflections.
Last year, Ichor acquired Ajax Custom Manufacturing of Union City, a plastic component supplier to major customers in the semiconductor capital equipment market. At the time, Ichor said the addition of Ajax will give it a great foundation for continued growth in semiconductor plastics, while opening up the opportunity for pursuing additional opportunities in liquid delivery processes.
Ichor sees the opportunity for market share gain in the chemical delivery systems market with new chemical delivery capabilities. The CMP chemical delivery process is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% from 2013 to 2018, also outpacing the growth in the WFE market.
The company's revenue growth has surpassed its customers and key competitor Ultra Clean Holdings Inc. (UCTT). From 2013 to 2016, Ichor has grown revenues at a CAGR of 23%, vs. 10% growth for customers and 8% growth for UCTT.
From $249 million in 2014, Ichor has grown revenues to $291 million in 2015 and $406 million in 2016, representing a 28% CAGR. But, during the same period adjusted Net income has grown at a whopping 64% CAGR, from $11.7 million in 2014 to $20.2 million in 2015 and $31.6 million in 2016.
Yet another definite plus is Ichor's ability to scale its business and respond efficiently to increases in demand, as customers expand with acquisitions.
The company says its low capex requirements and variable cost structure constitute a capital efficient, and leveraged earnings business model, respectively. Capex has declined from 1.4% of revenues in 2014 to 0.5% in 2015 and 1.1% in 2016, while GAAP operating expenses have declined from 13.2% of revenues in 2014 to 12.4% in 2015 and 10.2% in 2016.
For the second quarter of 2017, Ichor expects revenue $152 million to $162 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.63. At the time when the company released its guidance, analysts were modeling revenues of $138.8 million and EPS of $0.52. Current Street estimates have been revised up to EPS of $0.6 and revenues of $157.3 million, reflecting the company's guidance.
The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.2X vs. competitor UCTT's 11.9X.

2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "On its first earnings call as a publicly traded company, ICHR delivered strong results that largely matched positively pre-announcement and provided sequentially higher guidance that is above consensus estimates. While the buy-side is likely expecting upside to guidance given the strong shipments guidance from LRCX [Buy], one of its two large customers, we note that 1Q17 revenue is double from a year ago, clearly confirming momentum of ICHR's business. With high exposure to growing segments leveraging technology inflections in WFE and its success in winning at key customers, we believe ICHR will continue to outperform the industry.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/).

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please
