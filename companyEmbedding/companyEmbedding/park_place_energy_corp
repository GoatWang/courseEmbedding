Building a Regional Oil and Gas Company
Park Place Energy Inc. is a U.S. based oil and gas exploration company focused on building a portfolio of international exploration and development projects in Turkey and Southeast Europe. The Company’s focus is on recently acquired oil and gas producing assets in Turkey and a coal bed methane exploration license in Bulgaria.

In January 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of three oil and gas producing fields in Turkey. The main producing asset is a 36.75% interest in an offshore gas development project called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (SASB). The SASB involved 19 wells drilled, four platforms constructed in two phases, extensive shore-based logistical infrastructure, and significant pipeline and facilities construction to bring the gas to market.

Park Place’s priority is the expansion and revitalization of the SASB field during 2017 and beyond. By combining leading-edge technology to identify bypassed zones, the installation of artificial lift and new wells drilled from the existing platforms, we expect SASB to be a significant producing asset for the Company into the future.

About Us

The acquisition of Turkish assets marks a transformative event for the Company. We now have meaningful production and cash flow. We anticipate being able to increase production at the SASB field during 2017 and plan to drill new wells in 2018. We continue to look to expand our portfolio of oil and gas properties with particular focus on
 
Park Place holds rights to a natural gas play located in northeast Bulgaria that will produce gas from coal seams. The Company entered into a License Agreement and received regulatory approval from the environmental agency for its work programs but that approval was appealed by certain NGOs. Until the approval issue is resolved, the Company cannot commence its planned work programs. These work programs include the drilling up to 5 wells to demonstrate the technical feasibility and commercial potential of producing coal bed methane from this potentially world-class project.
 
Park Place is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, USA. The Company is led by a team of experienced international oil and gas executives, with decades of experience and much recent involvement in both Turkey and Bulgaria.
Corporate profile:

Park Place is incorporated in the State of Delaware, USA. It has its principal office in Dallas, Texas, an office in Ankara, Turkey and a satellite office in Sofia, Bulgaria.
As of February 1, 2017, Park Place has 55.4 million shares issued and outstanding.
Park Place is fully audited and is an SEC reporting entity.
The Company’s shares are presently quoted on the US:OTCBB and the OTC:QB under the ticker symbol PKPL.
The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Bulgaria for local operations.


History of Projects:

From 2006 to 2010, the Company held interests in several producing and non-producing properties in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta as well as in an offshore oil exploration block in the North Sea.
In 2009 and 2010, the Company disposed of substantially all of its North American properties to refocus its exploration efforts in Europe.
In October 2010, the Company was awarded an exploration permit for the Vranino 1-11 Block located in northeast Bulgaria by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers.
A competitor in the bidding competition contested the award and litigation ensued. In mid-2013 such the litigation was resolved in the Company’s favor.
In April 2014, the Company signed the License Agreement for the Vranino 1-11 Block.
In August 2014, the Bulgarian environmental agency approved the Company’s planned work programs for exploration of the Vranino 1-11 Block.
In September 2014, a number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental agency to approve our planned work programs.
Once the issues surrounding the regulatory approvals are resolved, the Company will commence on ground exploration activities on the Vranino 1-11.
In late December 2015, Park Place entered into an agreement to purchase three companies which have oil and gas production in Turkey.  The purchase was conditional on obtaining the approval of certain Turkish regulatory agencies.
The regulatory approvals were finally received in November 2016 and Park Place closed on the acquisition of the Tiway companies in January 2017.

Scott C. Larsen, President and Chief Executive Officer
Scott Larsen has had extensive experience in the acquisition and assimilation of oil and gas assets and companies and early stage development of oil and gas exploration companies. After completing his law degree at Rutgers University in 1979, Scott worked for US Department of Energy and Arco, served as general counsel to a small domestic oil company, was the oil and gas partner in a law firm and served as general counsel to an investment management company.  After honing his skills, in 1994 Scott took advantage of a unique opportunity to join the management team at TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd.

About Us (OBSOLETE)

Park Place holds rights to a natural gas play located in northeast Bulgaria that will produce gas from coal seams. The Company entered into a License Agreement and received regulatory approval from the environmental agency for its work programs but that approval was appealed by certain NGOs. Until the approval issue is resolved, the Company cannot commence its planned work programs. These work programs include the drilling up to 5 wells to demonstrate the technical feasibility and commercial potential of producing coal bed methane from this potentially world-class project.
 
The acquisition of Turkish assets marks a transformative event for the Company. We now have meaningful production and cash flow. We anticipate being able to increase production at the SASB field during 2017 and plan to drill new wells in 2018. We continue to look to expand our portfolio of oil and gas properties with particular focus on
 
Park Place is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, USA. The Company is led by a team of experienced international oil and gas executives, with decades of experience and much recent involvement in both Turkey and Bulgaria.
Corporate Profile:

Park Place is incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA. It has its principal office in Dallas, Texas and a satellite office in Sofia, Bulgaria.
As of September 30, 2014, Park Place has 45.6 million shares issued and outstanding.
Park Place is fully audited and is an SEC reporting entity.  
The Company’s shares are presently quoted on the US:OTCBB and the OTC:QB under the ticker symbol PKPL. 
The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Bulgaria for local operations.

Projects History:

From 2006 to 2010, the Company held interests in several producing and non-producing properties in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta as well as in an offshore oil exploration block in the North Sea.
In 2009 and 2010, the Company disposed of substantially all of its North American properties to refocus its exploration efforts in Europe.
In October 2010, the Company was awarded an exploration permit for the Vranino 1-11 Block located in northeast Bulgaria by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers.
A competitor in the bidding competition contested the award and litigation ensued.
In mid-2013 such the litigation was resolved in the Company’s favor. 
In April 2014, the Company signed the License Agreement for the Vranino 1-11 Block. 
In August 2014, the Bulgarian environmental ministry approved the Company’s planned work programs for exploration of the Vranino 1-11 Block. 
In September 2014, a number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental ministry to approve our planned work programs. 
Once the issues surrounding the regulatory approvals are resolved, the Company will commence on ground exploration activities on the Vranino 1-11 Block.

Overview of the Vranino Gas Project



Introduction
The Vranino project is situated in close proximity to a major gas pipeline in northeast Bulgaria.  The area covered by the License Agreement (the “license area”) was previously extensively explored for the potential to mine coal in the deep coal beds found in the Dobrudja Basin.  Based upon this prior coal exploration activity, we know these coal beds are a potentially prolific source of natural gas.  The main component of natural gas is methane and the data compiled from the prior coal exploration activity indicates the coals in the Dobrudja Basin contain natural gas that consists of 90-95% methane.  This methane is naturally occurring and will be produced through conventional drilling – the Company will not use coal gasification or hydraulic fracking, which is banned in Bulgaria.
The Company intends to initially drill up to five exploration wells, in a conventional and safe manner, consistent with best practices for environmental cleanliness and international standards.  If successful, the project will be a source of natural gas for the local community, will provide a cost savings for consumers and will reduce the need for Bulgaria to purchase expensive imported natural gas.
Historical exploration efforts
Between the 1960’s and the late 1980’s, over 220 wells were drilled on the Vranino 1-11 Block and the immediate surrounding area, with one additional well drilled in 2005. Of these wells, 120 wells are located on the Vranino 1-11 Block and intersect targeted gas bearing coal seams at depths of between 1200 meters and 2500 meters. 
The previous drilling centered on massive gas-charged coal deposits where over 60 individual coal seams (with varying thickness and gas content) have been identified. The coals are inter-bedded with various sandstones, which may also act as a reservoir for gas escaping from the gas bearing coals. The data gathered from the well drilled in 2005 confirmed numerous gas bearing zones of interest.
The Company has access to a massive amount of geological data in the Vranino 1-11 Block and the surrounding area, including logs, gas isotherms, location tops, temperature, DST and some core data, as a result of the prior drilling of such a large number of wells. Our evaluation of such data, which began in mid-2013, confirms that the Vranino 1-11 Block contains significant gas-bearing formations. 
While some of the wells have been converted to water wells, a large number of the existing wells are available for re-entry and possible deepening. One of the early objectives for Park Place will be to determine whether these wells can be successfully re-entered and deepened. If some of the old wells can be successfully used for future exploration, the Company could realize significant costs savings and higher returns. 
The coal beds in the Dobrudja Basin contain over 60 individual coal seams, many of which contain significant amounts of natural gas. Prior exploration activities targeted the coal seams for potential mining of the coal; however, the seams in the Dobrudja Basin were determined to be too deep for commercially viable coal mining.
 
Exploration and development strategy – a modern “green” approach
Park Place will use modern techniques for gas extraction that are environmentally friendly. (many of which have been developed in past 10 years). These techniques will not involve hydraulic fracking or underground coal gasification. 
Our plan is to initially drill 2 conventional vertical wells and core and test them; we will also re-enter and test an existing well. Once we evaluate the results, we will design and test completion techniques which will be safe and environmentally sound, and which we hope will optimize the production of natural gas from the coal seams. But we repeat: we will not use hydraulic fracking, which was banned in Bulgaria in 2012, or underground coal gasification.
In the USA, more than 50,000 wells have been drilled into coal seams in over a dozen basins. In Canada, over 10,000 wells have been drilled into coal seams. In the EU, there are currently underway projects targeting coal seams in the UK and pending in France.
