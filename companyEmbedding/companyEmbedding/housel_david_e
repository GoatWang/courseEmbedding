Career[edit]
Housel graduated from Auburn University in 1969 with a degree in journalism. He was news editor of The Huntsville News 1969-70, returning to Auburn as an administrative assistant in the athletic department ticket office 1970-72. He was an instructor in journalism at Auburn University and advisor to The Plainsman 1972-80. He became Assistant Sports Information Director under Buddy Davidson on July 1, 1980, and when Davidson relinquished in 1981, Housel was named sports information director. In April 1994 Housel was named athletic director, a position held until January 2005. Today, he is regarded as the unofficial historian of Auburn University. Simply put, Auburn’s athletic department has prospered under the direction of David Housel during his years as Athletic Director.
Housel is a past president of the SEC SID's, and a former chair of the NCAA Public Relations and Communications committees. He worked 18 straight Final Fours and served on the Media Coordination Committee from 1983 through 1994 when he was named Athletic Director. He has also served on the District III Postgraduate Scholarship Committee, and has served as chair of the Dean's Council for Auburn's College of Liberal Arts. Housel was also a member of the NCAA Championships Cabinet and the Executive Committee of the Southeastern Conference.
David has always stated that his top priority was to leave Auburn better than he found it. Not only did David leave Auburn better than he found it, he left countless coaches, student-athletes, staff and Auburn men and women everywhere better for having known him. Auburn won more than 30 Southeastern Conference titles during Housel’s tenure as AD, and an average of 14 Auburn teams a year advanced to post-season play during that span. Auburn Athletics also experienced unprecedented facilities enhancements during that time as well, including but not limited to the construction of Samford Stadium-Hitchcock Field at Plainsman Park, Jane B. Moore Field, the McWhorter Center for Women’s Athletics and the James T. Tatum Strength and Conditioning Center.
Of his many legacies, one that will outlive us all is that David has chronicled the history of Auburn Athletics.
Personal life[edit]
An award-winning free lance writer, Housel has written several books, including " Saturdays To Remember," "From the Desk to David Housel, A Collection of Auburn Stories." and "Auburn Glory Days: The Greatest Victories in Tigers History". An honorary member of the Auburn Football Lettermen Club and the University Singers, he is also a member of three Halls of Fame, the Sports Information Directors' Hall of Fame (1998), the Tony Brandino Hall of Fame (1998), and his hometown Hall of Fame. Housel still lives in Auburn.
Awards[edit]
The press box at Auburn's Jordan-Hare Stadium was officially named the David E. Housel Press Box in a dedication ceremony prior to the Tigers' 2005 football game against Mississippi. He was presented with the 2011 Coach Jack Meagher Award at Auburn University, an award is presented annually, “to a person with Auburn University affiliation who made significant contributions to society through athletics.”
He is also a past recipient of the Walter Camp Football Foundation Distinguished Service Award, and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame honored him as a Distinguished Alabama Sportsman.
During his career and in retirement, David has also served his church and community, earning recognition last year as a Distinguished Citizen of Lee County by the Boy Scouts of America

Editor's Note

Editor's Note: This story joins others in the 2017 Progress special section, featured inside Sunday's edition of the Opelika-Auburn News.




























































Editor's Note: This story joined others in the 2017 Progress special section. Copies are available at the office of the Opelika-Auburn News.David Housel began as a bundle of untapped passion, comprised of all the essential ingredients required of a die-hard fan: a love of football, an appreciation of the history, an ability to lose himself in the grandeur of a big game — if only he had any fandom to speak of.The year was 1956, the location was Birmingham, and the occasion was the annual Iron Bowl between host Alabama and visiting Auburn. Housel, led by his father, had never witnessed such a spectacle.The 10-year-old watched with wide eyes as the two teams clashed on the field below in a battle for his heart. All he needed was one of them to give him a convincing reason to move all-in.The Tigers won the game — “34-7,” Housel, now 70, said with a casualness that suggested the decades-old memory exists fresh in his mind — but Housel held onto his reservations for just a bit longer. Soon after the game, he decided to give each university one more chance, reaching out to both with handwritten letters.Auburn responded by sending him a media guide and a note thanking him for being an Auburn fan. Alabama sent him a media guide and a bill for two dollars.“I think it’s safe to say that Alabama got their two dollars,” Housel said, “but Auburn got my heart.”It was the note that made all the difference. Auburn made clear it wanted Housel, and from then on, Housel never stopped wanting to be a part of Auburn.In his Gordo High senior yearbook, the quote under Housel’s photo read: “Auburn, sweet Auburn, the loveliest village on the Plains.” All these years later — after graduating from AU in 1969 with a degree in journalism and rising from ticket office administrative assistant (1970-72), to journalism professor (1972-80), to assistant sports information director (1980-81), to head SID (1981-94), to athletic director (1994-2005), becoming an author and an award-winning freelance writer along the way  — Housel’s feelings about Auburn have never changed.“I think Auburn is a place where you can make it,” the Auburn athletics director emeritus said. “Farm boy, city boy, doesn’t matter — I think Auburn is a place you can make it. The only thing I’ve ever really dreamed of doing was coming to Auburn and being a part of it.”A part of it? No, Housel is far more than that.“David is Mr. Auburn,” current Auburn athletics director Jay Jacobs said. “There’s nobody else even close. When you talk about Auburn, he’s synonymous with it. All the good things that are represented by the Auburn family, that’s what David Housel embodies.”“David always used to say, ‘When people come to campus they may or may not remember what the final score was, but I want to make sure they remember how well they were treated at Auburn,’ and he’s always done that. Always. He always treated people with kindness and compassion and the Auburn way.”Most everyone on the Plains has felt it.“Who in Auburn doesn’t know David Housel?” Auburn mayor Bill Ham said. “Who hasn’t been impacted either by his writings or some of the things he’s been involved with? He is just absolutely a wonderful person. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Alumni Association (in 2015), and if you look at the list of individuals that have been awarded it, it is so incredible yet so fitting for him that he received that award because it exemplifies what David Housel is.”Memories from a storied careerAn irreplaceable piece of the Auburn story, Housel has gathered treasured memories along his journey.There was the time, in 1968, when Auburn football coach Shug Jordan greeted Housel with open arms at a football practice the morning after Housel won the election for editor of The Plainsman. The two chatted not as student-editor to SEC head coach, but as one friend to another.There were game days in the press box, images that remain crystallized in the memory of the former SID who says “nostalgia is my middle name.”“I would tell my staff, ‘It’s going to be our sports information staff against their sports information staff,’” Housel said. “And I said, ‘And we’re sure as hell going to win it.’ Auburn’s going to win it. Now how do you win a press box? You do the best job of being professional.”And then there was Oct. 29, 2005, when Housel was immortalized in Jordan-Hare Stadium by having the venue’s press box named after him during a ceremony in which a commemorative plaque was unveiled.“It was one of those experiences that teaches you humility… They had the plaque covered up by a Coke machine,” Housel said with a laugh. “So there’s this real nice thing going on, them talking about all my accomplishments and why they named it after me, and it was covered up by a Coke machine. Which is OK. It didn’t bother me. I thought that was pretty funny, and still do.”Of course Housel would relish the humor of it. That kind of thing is right up his alley.Jacobs remembers, in 2002, his drive back from Tuscaloosa with Housel after Auburn had won the Iron Bowl, 17-7. Housel made Jacobs stop at three or four convenience stores along the ride home.“We’d walk in and he’d buy a stick of gum or something and he’d always ask the person behind the counter, ‘Who won the Auburn-Alabama game?’ and wait for the reaction. Most of them had on an Alabama sweatshirt,” Jacobs recalled. “He had a lot of fun like that. I’ve even heard him ask people at restaurants, waiters and waitresses, ‘So what do you think about the athletic director, that Housel guy?’ He’s a guy that could laugh at himself and enjoy people as much as anybody I’ve ever seen.”The storyteller’s storyStill, along with getting a laugh out of it, Housel saw some symbolism in the coke machine-covered plaque.“Nothing is permanent,” Housel said. “There are folks that don’t know who I am and certainly they have no reason to. There are certainly people who work there who really never knew [football] coach [Pat] Dye and people for whom Bo Jackson is just a name out of history. And talking about coach Jordan now is like talking about Black Jack Pershing in World War I. Time passes, and as the years go by, you recede further and further to the background.”Housel then smiles: “And that’s fine with me.”In his dotage, Housel, for so long the articulator of Auburn’s story, confidently passes the baton to future generations. The interpretation of his own legacy is in their hands, too. But it’s Housel’s faith in Auburn’s posterity that is perhaps the truest way of quantifying his love for the place.“I think Auburn is a place that brings out the best in human nature,” he said. “I think if I have any role to play now, it’s probably as an elder statesman trying to define what Auburn was and what Auburn is, but it’s not for me to define what Auburn will be. That’s for the next generation, and I’m confident they’ll do a good job with it.”More than athleticsMatthew Holt, an AU graduate student in the pharmacy school and a member of that next generation, knew nothing of Housel before the two met in the spring semester of 2015.“This will make me sound very Auburn-naive,” Holt said, “but actually, no, I didn’t know much about him at all.”Holt took part in Housel’s Honors College book club while he was still in undergrad. During one class, Housel asked for a show of hands to see who had completed the assigned reading. It happened to be the one week Holt didn’t, and he was only person not to raise his hand.“So he told me, ‘All right, you can either read the book and come discuss it with me at a lunch, or fail the class,” Holt said. “Hopefully he was just kidding about that last part.”
Soon after, the two had lunch together at Byron’s Smokehouse on Opelika Road.“At first I was afraid: ‘Gosh, what is this going to be like?’ I was worried that he was going to be guilt-tripping me about not reading the assignment,” Holt said, “but there was really none of that. All he wanted was just a one-on-one chance to pick my brain and get all of my opinions and thoughts on what I had just read. He really just used it as a time to get to know me personally, and to have a deeper discussion.”This is the part of Housel’s legacy at Auburn that has nothing to do with athletics.“The reason I became his friend is because he wanted to contribute his time to the Auburn Honors College,” Holt said. “I would have never formed a relationship with him had he not chosen to keep contributing to Auburn in an area quite distinct from the athletic department.“This is a man who made it to the top of the athletic department, and of course that was his passion, but he’s never stopped trying to tell the world that Auburn is more than that.”Still hereRecently, Housel’s role has reduced to a small yet still neon-bright part of Auburn’s present-day story.“My priority in retirement,” Housel quipped, “is to stay out of everybody’s way.”He still holds his weekly Honors College book club (and Holt still attends, purely for leisure and the chance to meet up with his friend).“Out of everything I do,” Housel said, “I enjoy that as much as anything.”He reads a lot, and even attends two book clubs aside from the one he hosts. He walks with the help of a cane or walker, which does well to slow him down but does nothing to stop him from attending every Auburn football and basketball home game.Still, Housel is admittedly a bit detached, at least in relation to his days in the heart of Auburn’s athletics operation. Some relationships with current AU sports figures remain strong, but on the whole, he doesn’t know the players and coaches like he did back in the day.“But I know Auburn,” Housel said, “and I want Auburn to win.“Am I as emotionally involved as I was when I was 10 years old? I hope not. I hope I’ve grown up some. As for when I was working, the fate of the western world — the fate of civilization as we knew it — depended on the outcome of the Auburn-Alabama game. I have now realized it does not. And that has been a freeing experience.”Housel then paused. A disclaimer was necessary.“I answer all these questions like that,” he continued, “but had you been sitting next to me when Chris Davis ran that Alabama field-goal attempt back 109 yards (to give Auburn a last-second victory in the 2013 Iron Bowl)? You’d have said that old boy is 10 years old and the fate of the western world does depend on it!”For all his accomplishments and accolades at AU, for all his hours of service and powerful writings and orations about the place he calls home, Housel refuses to identify as anything more than “an Auburn guy who was lucky enough to spend his life here and is now enjoying his retirement years here.”“I busted my [butt] for Auburn not because of any reason other than just trying to make Auburn better,” Housel said. “And I was just fortunate to have some opportunities along the way.”Auburn was fortunate, too.
