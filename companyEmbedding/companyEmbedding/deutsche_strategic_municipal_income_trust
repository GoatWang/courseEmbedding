Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) 349-4281 and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.   Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Returns during part or all of the periods shown reflect a fee and/or expense waiver. Without this waiver, returns would have been lower and any rankings/ratings might have been less favorable. Expenses of the fund include investment advisory and administration fees and other fund expenses. Total returns shown take into account these fees and expenses.Growth of a $10,000 Investment from 06/30/07 to 06/30/17 06/0706/0906/1106/1306/1506/17Growth Chart$10000$10196$13347$16621$18738$20550SourceSource: Deutsche Asset Management.

    R-002918.8 (4/17)Important Objectives and Risk InformationThe fund seeks a high level of current income exempt from federal income tax. The fund invests at least 50% of its assets in investment-grade municipal securities or unrated municipal securities of comparable quality, and may invest up to 50% of its assets in high-yield municipal securities that are below investment grade. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the Fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.

Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) 349-4281 and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.   Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.

    R-002925.8 (4/17)Important Objectives and Risk InformationThe fund seeks to provide high current income exempt from federal income tax by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade, tax-exempt securities. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the Fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.

Each Fund has both common and preferred shares outstanding. In accordance with a position taken by the Internal Revenue Service, each Fund is required to allocate a proportionate share of distributions designated as taxable to both its common and preferred shares.Details are as follows:  Declaration- 12/09/2016           Ex-Date- 12/15/2016           Record- 12/19/2016           Payable- 12/30/2016                             Fund         Ticker         Short Term Capital Gain                                   (per common share)       Deutsche Municipal Income Trust             KTF            $0.0101     Deutsche Strategic Municipal Income Trust            KSM            $0.0348                    Important InformationDeutsche Municipal Income Trust seeks to provide high current income exempt from federal income tax by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade tax-exempt securities. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax.Deutsche Strategic Municipal Income Trust seeks a high level of current income exempt from federal income tax.

There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to the net asset value. The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Past performance is no guarantee of future results.This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction.        NOT FDIC/ NCUA INSURED • MAY LOSE VALUE • NO BANK GUARANTEE     NOT A DEPOSIT • NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY        Deutsche Asset Management represents the asset management activities conducted by Deutsche Bank AG or any of its subsidiaries.
