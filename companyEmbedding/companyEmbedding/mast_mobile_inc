Strong Employee Adoption



Save your sales reps an hour a day because they no longer need to manually enter data into the CRM.


Capture full and accurate data from all client communications in your CRM.


Employees can manage work and personal communication seamlessly but separately on one device. Personal use remains private.








Mast works with your current mobile carrier. Provides cellular quality calls, not VoIP.



























All calls. All texts. Automatically captured.




Your CRM is only as valuable as the data your reps enter. Get more value from your CRM investment by automatically capturing all calls and texts - inbound and outbound, whether on a reps' mobile phone or softphone, in the office or on the go, using one work number for each rep to maintain continuity with sales leads.













Comprehensive Quantitative Data


Mast creates a call record in the CRM for all calls linked to the contact with call time, duration and whether it is inbound or outbound. Full text conversations are loaded into a task record daily.


Rich Qualitative Data


At the end of calls with clients, Mast prompts the sales rep to enter notes and follow-ups. The rep dictates the notes and they are automatically added to the call record.













A work number ready for business.


Use one work number for all business calls instead of using personal mobile numbers that leave with departing sales reps. Get rid of underused desk phones.









Mast’s app replaces the dialer and seamlessly manages both work and personal calls.





Put work numbers on your team’s mobile phones with features like call transfer and hunt groups.









Use the Mast softphone on your desktop with click-to-dial from within your CRM - all using your same work number.





You have the option of recording your mobile sales calls so you can review and improve your pitch.


















One phone.Two numbers.Make calls the way you’re used to.


Employees benefit from just using one device but keeping work and personal separate - personal usage stays private.






































Use the right number for each contact with Mast’s patented technology.



Manage with simple swipe or tap gesture.Pre-sorts many of your contacts.Marks contacts as work or personal as you communicate with them.As soon as a contact is marked work or personal once, Mast always uses that number with them.








Works with your existing carrier, phone, and CRM system.
















































Providing
Solutions




We started to look for ways to integrate mobile calls and texts with our CRM platform, to eliminate data loss and empower our sales reps. We talked to other platform providers, but they didn’t have a solution. Then we found Mast with their unique mobile integration into Salesforce.

This is Mast



We launched Mast to reinvent communications for modern sales teams and businesses.  Every day, more work gets done on mobile devices—even if they’re in front of a desk phone, sales reps often use their mobile phone.
Our goal is to provide a communications platform that is integrated with the way we work, so we rethought mobile to embed the CRM into the rep’s day-to-day sales activities on their mobile phone.
Our primary area of focus is in building a platform to integrate work communications data into other enterprise applications to improve analytics and productivity.  Client communication data is highly valuable but companies haven’t been able to access it due to a lack of tools and systems or, often because end users do not adopt them.
We believe the right foundation has to be to create a seamless user experience, so people use their mobile devices normally, and to build in the network layer the ability to intelligently separate and capture the work communications data.

We asked some basic questions:

Why can’t I automatically load client calls and texts on my mobile phone into my CRM?
Why can’t I dictate a note and load it into my CRM on the go?
Why should anyone have more than one work number (nobody we know has more than one work email address)?
Why can a mobile phone only have one phone number?
Why am I carrying two phones, one for work and one for personal?
Why can’t you use your phone number on any connected device?

We came up with new answers. It’s easy to try out Mast, take a few minutes to do it now.  When you do, you’ll ask why hasn’t anybody ever done this before.
