IMPORTANT: PLEASE VOTE YOUR SHARES TODAY                                        

Your vote is extremely important.                                               

Dear Shareholder,                                                               

I am writing to remind you about the joint special meeting of shareholders to be
held on May 13, 2008, for all Pioneer open-end mutual funds. Shareholders of    
each fund are being asked to approve a number of proposals recently adopted by  
each Pioneer Fund's Board of Trustees. The Trustees believe that these proposals
outlined below will, among other things, streamline the operations of each fund.
We are seeking your approval of these proposals through the joint proxy         
statement, which is available to you on the Internet at                         
https://www.proxy-direct.com/pioneer. If you would rather receive a printed     
version of the proxy statement, you may request one via the Internet, or by     
calling 1-866-884-2702 and entering the control number and security code from   
your enclosed proxy card(s).                                                    

>  To vote by TouchTone telephone, call 1-866-241-6192.                         

>  To vote by Internet, go to www.proxy-direct.com/pioneer.                     

 You will need your control number and security code from your proxy card(s)
to vote by Internet or TouchTone telephone.                                     

>  To vote by mail, sign and date the proxy card(s) and return it/them in the   
enclosed postage-paid reply envelope.                                           

The proxy statement contains detailed information about each proposal being     
considered. Your fund's Board of Trustees has reviewed each proposal. In the    
Trustees' opinion, the proposals are in the best interests of fund shareholders 
and they recommend that you vote FOR each proposal. Please take a moment to read
the materials available on the Internet before casting your vote. We ask that   
you cast your vote regarding the following proposals:                           

Proposal 1: Elect Trustees. You are being asked to elect Trustees for each fund.
Each of the nominees, except one, currently serves as a Trustee for some or all 
of the Pioneer Funds.                                                           

Proposal 2A: Approve an amendment to the Declaration of Trust. Shareholders of  
Pioneer Funds that currently are organized as Delaware statutory trusts are     
being asked to approve an amendment to the Declaration of Trust for the funds.  
The Declaration is designed to grant the Board broader authority than it        
possesses currently to further amend the Declaration of Trust without           
shareholder approval.                                                           

Proposal 2B: Approve an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization. Shareholders of   
two Pioneer Funds that are now organized as Massachusetts business trusts are   
being asked to approve the reorganization of those funds as Delaware statutory  
trusts.                                                                         

P-->DEFA14A4th�Page�of�8TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
Proposals 3-A to 3-R: Revise Fundamental Investment Policies relating to:       
3-A     Borrowing                                                               
3-B     Underwriting                                                            
3-C     Lending                                                                 
3-D     Senior Securities                                                       
3-E     Real Estate                                                             
3-F     Commodities                                                             
3-G     Concentration                                                           
3-H     Diversification                                                         
3-I     Convert Investment Objective(s) from Fundamental to Non-Fundamental     
3-J     Illiquid Securities                                                     
3-K     Purchasing Securities on Margin                                         
3-L     Short Sales                                                             
3-M     Purchasing Securities on Margin and Making Short Sales                  
3-N     Investments in Other Investment Companies                               
3-O     Pledging or Guaranteeing Assets                                         
3-P     Investments Made for the Purpose of Exercising Control or Management of 
Issuers                                                         
3-Q     Investments in Affiliates                                               
3-R     Investments in Convertible Debt Securities Rated Below Investment Grade 

In Items 3A through 3R above, you are being asked to approve changes to the     
"fundamental" investment policies of your fund(s).                              

All mutual funds are required by law to have "fundamental" policies, that is,   
policies governing certain investment practices that may be changed only with   
the approval of fund shareholders. Many of the funds have fundamental policies  
that are not required by law or are more restrictive than the law requires, and 
the policies vary, sometimes considerably, from fund to fund. At the meeting,   
shareholders will be asked to approve revised fundamental policies, eliminate   
other investment objectives that cannot be changed without shareholder approval,
or to approve the reclassification of those investment objectives as            
"non-fundamental". These changes are intended to simplify compliance monitoring 
and provide additional flexibility for the funds.                               

Proposal 4: Approve an Amended and Restated Management Agreement with Pioneer   
Investment Management. You are being asked to approve an amended and restated   
management agreement between your fund(s) and its manager, Pioneer Investment   
Management, Inc. There will be no decrease in services or increase in management
fees as a result of the new management agreement.                               

Proposal 5: Approve a Policy Allowing the Appointment of Unaffiliated           
Sub-Advisers and Amendments to Sub-Advisory Agreements Without Shareholder      
Approval. Shareholders of certain funds are being asked to approve a policy that
would permit Pioneer--subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees-- to     
appoint unaffiliated sub-advisers to manage the funds, enter into sub-advisory  
agreements and amend existing sub-advisory agreements with unaffiliated         
sub-advisers, in each case without shareholder approval. The sub-adviser        
approval policy will not be used with respect to any agreement with a           
sub-adviser that is affiliated with Pioneer.                                    

P-->DEFA14A5th�Page�of�8TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
As a shareholder, you have the opportunity to voice your opinion and I encourage
you to do so. By voting your shares, you not only express to Pioneer how you    
feel about the matters under consideration, you also help eliminate the need for
subsequent mailings or phone calls designed to acquire sufficient votes to hold 
the meeting. Even if you own a relatively small number of shares, I urge you to 
take a moment and vote those shares today.                                      

Remember you may vote by telephone, Internet or by mail.                        

NOTE: If you vote by phone or Internet, please do not return your proxy card(s).

Again, I encourage you to vote your shares as quickly as possible and I thank   
you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. If you have any        
questions about this proxy solicitation or any of the proposals, please call    
1-866-526-4104.                                                                 

Sincerely,                                                                      

Daniel Kingsbury,

[PIONEER LOGOS]                                                                 
IMPORTANT: PLEASE VOTE YOUR SHARES TODAY                                        

Your vote is extremely important, no matter how many shares you own.            

Dear Shareholder,                                                               

I am writing to remind you about the joint special meeting of shareholders to be
held on May 13, 2008, for all Pioneer open-end mutual funds. Shareholders of    
each fund are being asked to approve a number of proposals recently adopted by  
each Pioneer Fund's Board of Trustees. The Trustees believe that these proposals
outlined below will, among other things, streamline the operations of each fund.
We are seeking your approval of these proposals through the joint proxy         
statement, which is available to you on the Internet at                         
https://www.proxy-direct.com/pioneer or enclosed. You will need to enter the    
control number and security code from your enclosed proxy card(s) to vote.      

>  To vote by TouchTone telephone, call 1-866-241-6192.                         

>  To vote by Internet, log into www.proxy-direct.com/pioneer.                  

You will need your control number and security code to vote by Internet or
TouchTone telephone.                                                            

>  To vote by mail, sign and date the proxy card(s) and return it/them in the   
enclosed postage-paid reply envelope.                                           

The proxy statement contains detailed information about each proposal being     
considered. Your fund's Board of Trustees has reviewed each proposal. In the    
Trustees' opinion, the proposals are in the best interests of fund shareholders 
and they recommend that you vote FOR each proposal. Please take a moment to read
the materials available on the Internet before casting your vote. We ask that   
you cast your vote regarding the following proposals:                           

Proposal 1: Elect Trustees. You are being asked to elect Trustees for each fund.
Each of the nominees, except one, currently serves as a Trustee for some or all 
of the Pioneer Funds.                                                           

Proposal 2A: Approve an amendment to the Declaration of Trust. Shareholders of  
Pioneer Funds that currently are organized as Delaware statutory trusts are     
being asked to approve an amendment to the Declaration of Trust for the funds.  
The Declaration is designed to grant the Board broader authority than it        
possesses currently to further amend the Declaration of Trust without           
shareholder approval.                                                           

Proposal 2B: Approve an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization. Shareholders of   
two Pioneer Funds that are now organized as Massachusetts business trusts are   
being asked to approve the reorganization of those funds as Delaware statutory  
trusts.

3-C     Lending                                                                 
3-D     Senior Securities

3-F     Commodities                                                             
3-G     Concentration                                                           
3-H     Diversification                                                         
3-I     Convert Investment Objective(s) from Fundamental to Non-Fundamental     
3-J     Illiquid Securities

3-L     Short Sales                                                             
3-M     Purchasing Securities on Margin and Making Short Sales                  
3-N     Investments in Other Investment Companies                               
3-O     Pledging or Guaranteeing Assets                                         
3-P     Investments Made for the Purpose of Exercising Control or Management of 
Issuers                                                         
3-Q     Investments in Affiliates                                               
3-R     Investments in Convertible Debt Securities Rated Below Investment Grade 

In Items 3A through 3R above, you are being asked to approve changes to the     
"fundamental" investment policies of your fund(s).                              

All mutual funds are required by law to have "fundamental" policies, that is,   
policies governing certain investment practices that may be changed only with   
the approval of fund shareholders. Many of the funds have fundamental policies  
that are not required by law or are more restrictive than the law requires, and 
the policies vary, sometimes considerably, from fund to fund. At the meeting,   
shareholders will be asked to approve revised fundamental policies, eliminate   
other investment objectives that cannot be changed without shareholder approval,
or to approve the reclassification of those investment objectives as            
"non-fundamental". These changes are intended to simplify compliance monitoring 
and provide additional flexibility for the funds.                               

Proposal 4: Approve an Amended and Restated Management Agreement with Pioneer   
Investment Management. You are being asked to approve an amended and restated   
management agreement between your fund(s) and its manager, Pioneer Investment   
Management, Inc. There will be no decrease in services or increase in management
fees as a result of the new management agreement.                               

Proposal 5: Approve a Policy Allowing the Appointment of Unaffiliated           
Sub-Advisers and Amendments to Sub-Advisory Agreements Without Shareholder      
Approval. Shareholders of certain funds are being asked to approve a policy that
would permit Pioneer--subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees-- to     
appoint unaffiliated sub-advisers to manage the funds, enter into sub-advisory  
agreements and amend existing sub-advisory agreements with unaffiliated         
sub-advisers, in each case without shareholder approval. The sub-adviser        
approval policy will not be used with respect to any agreement with a           
sub-adviser that is affiliated with Pioneer.

As a shareholder, you have the opportunity to voice your opinion and I encourage
you to do so. By voting your shares, you not only express to Pioneer how you    
feel about the matters under consideration, you also help eliminate the need for
subsequent mailings or phone calls designed to acquire sufficient votes to hold 
the meeting. Even if you own a relatively small number of shares, I urge you to 
take a moment and vote those shares today.                                      

Remember you may vote by telephone, Internet or by mail.                        

NOTE: If you vote by phone or Internet, please do not return your proxy card(s).

Again, I encourage you to vote your shares as quickly as possible and I thank   
you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. If you have any        
questions about this proxy solicitation or any of the proposals, please call:

Quarterly Performance Update (and expense ratio information) »









Share Class Guide (including Sales Charges, CDSC and more) »










Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Other share classes are available for which performance and expenses will differ. For fund descriptions, historical and current performance, standardized returns as of the most recent quarter-end, risk disclosure or a prospectus, please click fund names in the tables below. NAV results represent the percent change in net asset value per share. POP returns reflect maximum 5.75% sales charge for all equity funds, asset allocation funds, and international funds; balanced, flexible and all income funds have a maximum 4.50% sales charge, except Pioneer Short-Term Income Fund and Pioneer Multi-Asset Ultrashort Income Fund, which have a maximum 2.50% sales charge. Pioneer U.S. Government Money Market Fund is sold at NAV. Class C (% if redeemed) shares held for less than one year are also subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
