      Public Company Information:          




NASDAQ:ALXN 







  "Most noteworthy, John        has created a world-class legal team who are committed and proactive in        supporting the operations necessary to provide optimal care to patients        suffering with devastating disorders." 



CHESHIRE, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced key measures 
      to strengthen and broaden its executive leadership team in line with the 
      Company’s expanding global mission to develop and commercialize 
      life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and rare disorders.
    

      David Hallal is being promoted to the newly created position of Chief 
      Operating Officer and has been appointed to Alexion’s Board of 
      Directors. Mr. Hallal had previously served as Executive Vice President 
      and Chief Commercial Officer, and will continue to lead all commercial 
      operations globally with responsibility for country operations in each 
      of Alexion’s affiliates in EMEA, Japan, Australasia, and Latin America. 
      As Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Hallal will additionally now lead key 
      enterprise-wide initiatives and he will expand his role with external 
      stakeholders.
    

      “David’s focus and commitment to patient care and strong leadership 
      across our operations are an important component of the foundation for 
      Alexion’s future growth,” said Leonard Bell, M.D., Chief Executive 
      Officer of Alexion. “Additionally, David’s increasing role to lead 
      enterprise-wide operations is vital as we expand globally to serve more 
      patients suffering with severe and life-threatening disorders in more 
      countries. As we continue to build Alexion, David’s judgment and 
      experience will be an important additional voice on our Board of 
      Directors.”
    

      Clare Carmichael is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Human Resources Officer (CHRO) from her previous position of Senior Vice 
      President and CHRO. Ms. Carmichael will continue to lead and 
      significantly expand the Company’s global talent initiatives including 
      talent management, talent acquisition, training and development, and 
      compensation and benefits.
    

      “Clare has been a key leader in the ongoing transformation of Alexion 
      across each of our countries, regions, and corporate functions,” said 
      Dr. Bell. “Clare has provided strong leadership to the transformation of 
      Alexion’s talent and structure across the entire organization, including 
      senior management, which has been a critical component of our robust 
      growth. Under Clare’s leadership, Alexion has grown from approximately 
      800 to more than 2,000 employees across an increasingly complex 
      organization now operating in nearly 50 countries. As we look to our 
      opportunity to serve more patients, Clare’s increased responsibility 
      within the organization is vital as we continue attracting and retaining 
      the highest levels of talent required to serve patients across the globe 
      suffering with devastating and rare disorders.”
    

      John Moriarty, J.D. is being promoted to Executive Vice President and 
      General Counsel from his previous position of Senior Vice President and 
      General Counsel. Mr. Moriarty will continue to lead all of the Company’s 
      legal, government affairs and corporate communications activities, 
      further expanding each of these functions to support the Company’s 
      ongoing global growth.
    

      “John has provided a strong vision of global leadership for the legal, 
      government affairs, and corporate communications functions at Alexion, 
      which have contributed significantly to our growth in the dynamic 
      environments in which we operate,” said Dr. Bell. “Most noteworthy, John 
      has created a world-class legal team who are committed and proactive in 
      supporting the operations necessary to provide optimal care to patients 
      suffering with devastating disorders.”
    

      Additionally, the Company is pleased to announce that Edward Miller, 
      J.D. has joined Alexion in the newly created position of Senior Vice 
      President and Chief Compliance Officer. Mr. Miller will lead all 
      corporate compliance functions globally for Alexion.
    

      “Ed has a very strong background domestically and internationally across 
      all areas of compliance. He has been a strong first-mover in the 
      industry to recognize the importance, and lead the development of 
      cultures and programs that promote compliance,” said Dr. Bell. “As we 
      continue to grow worldwide to best serve patients, our commitment to 
      ethical business practices has never been greater, and Ed will continue 
      to build upon the strong compliance program Alexion has established over 
      the past several years.”
    

      “I am truly excited to be joining a company with such a strong focus on 
      patients and commitment to excellence,” said Mr. Miller. “I hope to 
      build on that culture and enhance the already existing commitment to 
      compliance and ethics as we fulfill our mission of bringing innovative 
      treatments to patients with devastating conditions around the world.”
    

      All four executives will report directly to Dr. Bell.
    

      The promotions of Mr. Hallal, Ms. Carmichael, and Mr. Moriarty, and the 
      addition of Mr. Miller, are designed to facilitate the further growth of 
      Alexion to serve more patients with severe and devastating disorders 
      around the world.

      he led the highly successful U.S. launch of the Company's first product,

      responsibilities to Chief Commercial Officer. In addition to his

 The MI6 is recalling its men after the botched “Arab Spring”. It was Sir James Craig who in 2004 put this project together, its essential aim being to produce an “Arab Revolt” just like Lawrence of Arabia had organized against the Ottoman empire. During the First World War, Thomas Lawrence promised the Arabs their unity and freedom if they succeeded in toppling the Ottoman coloniser. At the end of the day, they had the British Empire. This time the “Arab Spring” was conceived with Iran in (...)

 On 27 May 2017, Interpol has sent to every single European police force a list, drawn up by the US Intelligence Services, of 173 members of Daesh. According to the Guardian (the journalistic source for this information), the United States thinks it has identified a number of jihadists (European sourced), that Isis has trained to carry out suicide attacks in their country of origin. To justify possessing this information, the United States guarantees that it had access to credible sources (...)

 The appearance of a new alliance in... 
 President Trump's policy in the Greater Middle East is beginning to materialise. While up until now, the United States and their allies have been attempting to destroy states and impose chaos, they are now legitimising alliances against the jihadists. Although in theory, Iran, Syria and the Hezbollah are still enemies to be defeated, in practice, they have become partners. In the end, this new deal could enable the states of the region to force the multinational companies out of the political sphere and re-establish peace.

 Cartography: Orient-Le Jour The Jurd of Ersal is a mountainous zone, about 150 km2, situated between Lebanon and Syria. Its highest point exceeds 3000 m. In the winter, it is covered by several metres of snow and this is why it is uninhabited. Since 2011, about 3,000 jihadists and their families have taken refugee there. But today there would be no more than 1,000, spread between two groups: al-Qaeda and Daesh. For several months, negotiations have been underway between the jihadists (...)

 On 20 July 2017, Turkey's Great Assembly has adopted a new law, prohibiting its parliamentarians from insulting Turkey's glorious history by using the words, “Armenian Genocide”, “Kurdistan” and “Kurdish regions”. It is well known, common knowledge as it were - but only common to members of the AKP and the MHP (Parties of Nationalist Action) - that the “events of 1915” did not last from 1895 to 1896 and from 1915 to 1916.
