Our mission is to be the leading supplier of IoT gateways that enable companies to dramatically simplify the creation, deployment, and management of IoT projects while providing secure access to data for applications and people.
With more than two decades of experience in creating robust machine to machine (M2M) technologies, Lantronix is an innovator in enabling our customers to build new business models and realize the possibilities of the Internet of Things. Our connectivity solutions are deployed inside millions of machines serving a wide range of industries, including data center, medical, security, industrial, transportation, retail, financial, environmental and government. 
Device and (big) data management, mobility, enterprise-level security and networking are key pillars in the reality of IoT. And addressing these fundamental pillars is exactly what we do. Our products, solutions, and services enable connectivity (wired, Wi-Fi and cellular) and the management of “things” – machines, devices, sensors, computers, and more. Customers embed, attach and deploy Lantronix solutions to a wide range of devices — from medical devices in a hospital to municipal water monitoring systems  to industrial equipment in factories to high powered switches and routers that serve as the backbone for data centers.
In short, we’ve been helping companies connect to the Internet — reliably, intelligently, securely and quickly — for more than 25 years.





Security

Industry-leading, enterprise security to protect your data






Management

Manage virtually any device or machine, from anywhere






Mobility

Mobile-enable your IoT solutions, for access from anywhere, any device





 
Timeline of Innovation
Our innovative IoT and M2M products and solutions have won us dozens of industry awards, and have enabled the design and deployment of more than four million devices and IoT applications around the world. Following are selected examples of our award-winning, specialized IoT and M2M networking breakthroughs.


2015 

In calendar 2013 and 2014, Lantronix launched a record number of new products, services and solutions – more than a dozen IoT and M2M networking solutions including xPico Wi-Fi, xPrintServer Office (iOS) and CloudPrint (Android/Google), the SLC8000, xSenso, xDirect, xPort Pro Lx6, a new Professional Services organization, and more. In early 2015, we see customers and the entire IoT and M2M markets making significant strides in moving from early designs and prototyping, into manufacturing, product / application launch and more mass deployments.
We marked 2015 with a January announcement with Konica Minolta –a global leader in delivering state-of-the-art hardware and software solutions to help customers capture, access, manage and print documents across a range of devices from office MFPs to mobile devices. The two companies jointly announced the Lantronix xPrintServer® – Cloud Print Edition mobile printing solution had been added to Konica Minolta’s EnvisionIT portfolio.  The xPrintServer will enable mobile workers to wirelessly print from Android and Google Cloud Print-ready devices to any Konica Minolta bizhub MFP for increased business productivity.
Shortly thereafter, Lantronix took the show on the road, exhibiting and demonstrating new products at Embedded World 2015 – the largest annual embedded event covering the entire EMEA region. Our focus was on demonstrating how our innovative products are fueling the progression of the IoT market – from concepts and product development to full blown production. The company provided live demonstrations of its xPico® Wi-Fi® and PremierWave® product families, its support for Python scripting language, several Lantronix IoT-enabled product applications, including the award-winning xPico Wi-Fi-powered Torquing ZANO autonomous drone and a PremierWave EN-powered humanoid robot. Additionally, Lantronix will demonstrate factory provisioning of the xPico Wi-Fi module in a manufacturing floor setting, as well as the integration into a cloud-based device management platform



2014 

Lantronix announces Python support for Company’s Intelligent Device Software Platform – Starting with its PremierWave® family of Intelligent Gateways. Support for the industry’s most popular programming language, combined with ruggedized Lantronix Intelligent Gateways enables rapid development and deployment of secure IoT applications. To support customers and Python hobbyists, the Company launched a new developers’ wiki to provide downloadable sample scripts, instructions, and a platform for community sharing and collaboration.
In support of its award-winning xPico family, the Company announced the xPico Wi-Fi SMT – whose new capabilities simplify Wi-Fi integration for large scale IoT applications, while simultaneously enabling mobile device access to machines. The new SMT version is a certified, compact Wi-Fi surface mount module which enables quick and easy serial-to-Wi-Fi connectivity – critical to the needs of OEM design engineers and developers looking to develop IoT applications and solutions, in particular those requiring direct access to device data via smartphone, tablets, and connected PCs. And for those looking to add Wi-Fi to existing or new Raspberry Pi applications, the company also announced an xPico® Wi-Fi Pi Plate expansion board – which enables the easy integration of the Lantronix xPico Wi-Fi device server with the popular Raspberry Pi single board computer.
One of the major milestones of calendar year 2014 was the launch of the new SLC 8000. This groundbreaking console manager enables IT professionals in Fortune 500 organizations and test labs of any size to remotely manage, monitor and troubleshoot IT equipment – and it’s the industry’s first modular console manager. Designed to reduce deployment and management costs and time by providing secure, centralized out-of-band management to most IT equipment, the new SLC 8000 can be expanded from eight to 48 ports. In a typical deployment, each port would manage one piece of IT equipment such as a switch, router, or server. This modular design makes the SLC 8000 the first of its kind, allowing users to simply add or swap modules to expand device port density and power supply, or introduce new interfaces such as USB.
Lantronix has a history of supporting the education industry. And in August of 2014, the Company rallied around the “Digital Classroom” with the launch of its new Print and Learn (PAL) Program. In partnership with the National Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), the Company set out to helps schools and universities get the most out of mobile devices by providing discounts, programs, and social media outlets to support mobile printing via its award-winning xPrintServer product family.
In March of 2014, the Company solidified its place as a leader in mobile printing by bolstering its product line with the new xPrintServer Cloud Print Edition – the first and only Google Cloud Print-Certified mobile printing solution for businesses. Enabling secure enterprise-wide cloud printing, the newest xPrintServer enables a user’s supported printers to print using cloud print technology from Android OS mobile devices, as well as any device running Google’s Chrome browser and Chrome operating system (ChromeOS).



2013 

Announces Wyless partnership to deliver robust cellular technology and turnkey solutions into the global cellular market. With this new partnership, Lantronix’ customers can fast track their cellular M2M application development.
Lantronix announces the next-generation Lantronix® SLB (Secure Lantronix Branch office manager)™, a significant upgrade to the company’s existing integrated secure console server including critical features such as emote power management.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
