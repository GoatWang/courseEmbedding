 Comments 8/2/166-foot, 185-pound medium sized body frame. From the infield he uses adequate footwork to approach ground balls, while continuing to play through the baseball. Has some quickness to his release throwing with a clean, short arm action through a low ¾ slot, reaching a top velocity of 69 mph. Right-handed hitter starts his swing from an open stance, getting himself squared back up to even when he strides. Has minimal load with his hands getting to a good launch position before he swings. Swings with a level bat path through the zone, finishing with a two-handed follow through. Recorded a top exit velocity of 89 mph and ran a 4.86 home to first base time. On the mound he throws exclusively from the stretch, using regular effort to his delivery. The submarine pitcher, lands closed throwing across his body. Throws with average arm speed. His fastball has sinking movement thrown between 64-67 mph. The curveball has gradual break to it with 11/5 tilt at 53-55 mph. Throws the changeup using fastball arm speed consistently at 60 mph.   1/24/166-foot, 180-pound athletic, projectable frame. At the plate he starts in a tall, slightly open set up. Using an easy hands back load with an aggressive stride forward he is able to create good forward energy while remaining balanced. Had quickness in his bat as his hands fired through the zone on a level path. Was able to consistently barrel up balls in batting practice and reached a top exit velocity of 83 mph. Looked comfortable and smooth in the infield. Showed good footwork approaching ground balls and soft hands funneling the ball into his body. Would like to see him get more out of his lower half as he gathers to throw. From a sidearm slot he showed 73 mph arm strength across the diamond. Ran a 4.28 from home to first. On the mound he is a true submarine guy. Never throws from over the top and looks to be 100% comfortable with his low slot. Was able to consistently locate his fastball down in the zone with heavy run and sink at 66-70 mph. Leading his arsenal of off-speed was his slider that had big break across the plate at 51-52 mph. His curveball had a little more hump to it and was more firm at 54-57 mph. Had good feel for his 62-63 mph changeup that had late sink to it. 6/23/156-foot, 160-pound thin, athletic body frame with room to fill out with. From the infield he shows pretty good footwork approaching ground balls, but could be a little more aggressive playing through the baseball. He allows the ball to get deep into his body and would like to see him field with his hands more out front. He throws using a clean, short arm action coming from a ¾ slot, reaching a top velocity of 73 mph across the infield. Right-handed hitter starts from a slightly open stance, getting back to being squared up to even. He uses a fluid hands back load, with a slightly upward bat path. He finishes with a high, two-handed follow through. Showed the ability to use the whole field during his round of batting practice and reaching a top exit velocity of 75 mph. He ran a 4.60 out of the batter’s box. On the mound he pitches exclusively from the stretch, using regular effort to his delivery. He lands closed at foot strike, throwing across his body. He uses average arm speed, coming from a side-arm slot. His fastball had some arm-side run to it between 67-70 mph. His curveball was at 54-56 mph with gradual sinking action. He threw his changeup using fastball arm speed, that showed sink at 62-63 mph.2/22/156-foot, 160-pound prospect with average, athletic frame. Likely projects best as a position player at this stage. Offensively, the right-handed hitter demonstrated a consistent, repeatable swing. Starts open and gets foot down early. Gap-to-gap approach with some pop in his bat. Gets good extension. Defensively, he projects as a second baseman. Arm strength (72 mph across the infield) has room for improvement, but gets rid of the ball quick with his transfer. Throws from ¾ slot. Hands work at this stage. Still needs to improve flexibility in his lower half. Ran a 4.9 home to first. On the mound, the right-handed pitcher is a relief type working exclusively from the stretch. Throws from a side arm slot. Demonstrated command of multiple pitches in the strike zone. Fastball sat in the mid to upper-60s, topping out at 69 mph with arm-side run. Breaking ball showed 10/4 spin at 54-57 mph. Mostly stayed on one plane. Changeup was down in the zone at 62-63 mph.
