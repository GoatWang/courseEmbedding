Thank you and good morning. I’ll remind you all that there is a slide presentation to go along with the audio portion for your use. As has now become customary before we get into the slide deck I’d like to make a few opening remarks. At the end of the day this quarter was indelibly marked by two significant events and as it transpired these events happened on the same day. And it was a day we were all anticipating, the process was arduous, negotiations difficult and multi-faceted and the amount of due diligence performed was massive. Over a year of effort went into crafting what I have described repeatedly as a win-win-win-win scenario. Finally on December 9th of 2014 the culmination of all these efforts was the signing of the agreement to resume production of the Gulfstream G650 and G280 programs from Spirit AeroSystems. 
This singular transaction marked a significant step forward for Triumph, strengthening an already solid position in the integrated wing business and adding key products on growth platforms to replace some of our sunsetting production. Overall a very positive development. The part of that day that we were not eagerly awaiting was Boeing’s announcement of a production rate cut on their 747-8 program from 1.5 to 1.3 per month. As you know as close to the profitability edge as we were, any reduction in rate put us into a loss position on the contract and will require a charge to be taken.
So when we take the measure of this quarter, as I have mentioned, we really need to look no further than December 9th, because on that day the two single largest events in the quarter occurred. The good news we can all take from these two events is that the negative repercussions of the 747 rate cut, as painful as they are in the immediate term, are largely in our rearview mirror. Jeff McRae will take you through in detail the composition of the charges that we recorded and while no one can guarantees that there will no future charges on this program you will see that we have taken a number of important steps that lessen the likelihood of recurrence.

On the flip side the Gulfstream wing business in Tulsa is in its early stages and will provide benefits to Triumph and its shareholders for decades to come. The pathway from signing to closing was well executed by both parties and we have now operated in Tulsa for just about one month. We had hoped for high level acceptance in the labor force, although we planned for a more pessimistic case. 
On this front reality was more in line with our hopes and we’ve retained a very high percentage of the workforce in Tulsa which should in-turn lead to less than planned disruption and a speedier return to the improvement curves already in place. The quality of the delivered product remains high and deliveries are being made in accordance with our plan. Importantly we have aligned cross functional teams of key personnel in place to validate the synergy assumptions we have made and to develop and deploy specific plans to attain them.
Now certainly there is more to this quarter than two events and we will discuss these things in detail as we go. One more general comment before we get into the slides. Triumph Group through the years has grown from basically a loose confederation of independent companies to what is now a large group of companies that together are a formidable force in the marketplace. We have now reached the point where we at the enterprise level can leverage the strength of our portfolio to add value and to drive growth. 
We have engaged experts in several fields to help us identify and quantify value propositions and develop executable plans to achieve our goals. These will include a more robust view of the supply chain across the enterprise, the valuation of footprint consolidation opportunities, further capitalizing on tax efficiencies as our global footprint continues to expand, and using more effective means of driving best practices across the enterprise. As these initiatives take form and become measurable we look forward to sharing them with you.
With that serving as a preamble let’s turn to slide three titled Q3 in review. Overall the third quarter delivered a strong cash flow performance and Jeff will provide color on this. In the Aerostructures segment, and we’ll get into this in some detail, revenues were impacted by decreased C-17 production and lower non-recurring revenue. If you recall last year in Q3 we had a significant amount of 767 tanker non-recurrent [ph]. The operating results included the $152 million forward loss charges in 747-8 program and Jeff will get into that again in detail and I am sure we’ll cover some of the details in the call in the questions as well. 
What I want to make sure we understand is that this charge did not in fact change our commitment to continue to take actions to reduce costs and improve performance. Performance continues to improve on the program and we will not let up on continuing to drive improvements as we go forward.
In the quarter we also took $13.9 million of charges related to lower than expected performance to Triumph Structures International. Jeff will get into some detail on this as well. And importantly the Red Oak transition to pre-move performance remains on target for the end of the fiscal year. And as far as our Aerospace Systems is concerned we had a very good quarter. We experienced positive organic revenue growth with sustainable strong operating margins and the integration of our newest acquisition in that segment to GE Aviation Hydraulic Actuation business continues to progress well, currently running ahead of our synergy targets. And in terms of after-market services we experienced positive organic revenue growth with sustained strong operating margins. 
So let's turn to Slide Four. I've already covered the first bullet and so I'll let that speak for itself. The transition is in fact progressing well. I'm happy to announce that we've recently been awarded multi-year work packages and multiple Triumph sites with combined value in excess of $50 million from Spirit, for metallic machine parts and sub-assemblies. And finally we bought back 336,271 shares for approximately $21.6 million.

At this time I'll turn the call over to Jeff McRae. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. I will start with a review of the financial results for our third quarter, turning first to the income statement. 
Net sales for the third fiscal quarter were $917.4 million, up slightly from the prior year period. Operating loss for the quarter was $61.3 million, resulting in a net loss of $39.8 million or $0.79 loss per share. Results for the quarter included a $169.2 million of charges in the Aerostructure segment, the majority of which were related to the forward losses associated with 747-8 program. In addition there were $3.5 million of transaction related cost related to the resumption of the Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs that were included in the corporate results. Excluding these items net income was $72.1 million or $1.42 per diluted share. The number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter was 50.8 million shares.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $37 million. Excluding the impact of forward losses associated with 747-8 program and the Red Oak facility transition cost adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $117.2 million. Looking at our segment performance, sales in the Aerostructures segment for the third quarter declined 12% to $559.5 million, primarily due to decreased production in the C17 program as well as lower non-recurring revenue on the 767 tanker program.
Third quarter operating loss was $102.5 million and included $3.3 million of cost related to Red Oak facility transition and a net favorable cumulative catch up adjustment on long term contracts, excluding the 747-8 program of $900,000. The segment’s operating results included total charges of $155 million associated with the 747-8 program, a $152 million of which represented forward losses on the balance of units under contract and $3 million was a negative cumulative catch up adjustment.
The next slide shows the components of the forward loss provision. The magnitude of the loss is larger than we had previously indicated. As we fully incorporated the anticipation of future rate variability we also lowered our expectation of labor and cost performance through the end of the contract and we adjusted for lower anticipated pension benefit in future periods based on the incorporation of new mortality tables in the calculation of our pension obligations. And we also included incremental overhead absorption resulting from moving non 747-8 program out of the existing 747 facilities.
The forward loss covers unit deliveries assumed to stretch in to fiscal year 2019, roughly four years of production in front of us and roughly $1.1 billion of revenue, with actual cash losses being back end loaded due to pricing breaks provided in the last production lot. As Jeff mentioned we will continue to look for ways to improve performance and drive costs down in the 747-8 program. This will involve continuing to work with our customers and suppliers to identify opportunities and also engaging third-party consultancy to further evaluate opportunities and drive implementation of improvements.
The segment’s operating results were also negatively impacted by lower than expected performance at Triumph Structures International, our composites manufacturing facility located in Farnborough, England resulting in $13.9 million of pretax charges. This company lost its [indiscernible] certification due to systemic issues within their quality system in late 2013 resulting in unanticipated delays in production and deliveries and delaying our planned transition of work to a sister company in Taiwan. 
These issues resulted in charges being taken in the quarter related to current and forward losses as well as an inventory impairment. We have installed new leadership into this organization and are closely monitoring recovery plans and would expect full recovery in early fiscal 2016, which would then allow us to reengage in product transfer plans. 

As Jeff mentioned we continued to make good progress in ramping up production at Red Oak and expect to meet our target at getting back to pre-move levels by the end of the fiscal year. The only exception is the C-17 program which has continued to experience delays due to part shortages for which we will see some revenue slippage out of fiscal year 2015 into the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Red Oak did deliver the initial test article wing for the Global 7000/8000 and is making good progress on this program. 
As Jeff mentioned we are also working on several initiatives, which are focused on driving performance improvements and reducing costs, both within the heritage Vought business as well as our tier 2 structure businesses, which will provide a catalyst for margin expansion as we move into fiscal year 2016 and beyond. As mentioned earlier, on December 30 we did close in the Tulsa Gulfstream wings transactions, which included the receipt of a $160 million, which is included in the cash flow statement within the line, acquisitions net of cash acquired. 
The balance sheet as of December 31 also included provisional balances for the transaction which will be refined over the next few quarters. We are also working to refine our business plans for these two programs, but based on early indications we are seeing improvements to our base case performance assumptions. We are still confident that we will be cash positive by the end of fiscal 2018 on these programs, with the 650 program being in much better shape today than the 280 program. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $81.9 million. Excluding the impact of the forward losses associated with the 747-8 program and the Red Oak facility transition cost adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $72.2 million. The segment operating margin for the quarter was 16% after adjusting for the 747-8 program as well as the costs related to the Red Oak transition and Triumph's Structures International's performance. 
Moving on to aerospace system, segment sales were $279.2 million, compared to $211.4 million in the prior year period, an increase of 32%, reflecting 2% organic growth and the impact of the acquisition of the GE Hydraulic Actuation business. Third quarter operating income increased 29% from the prior year quarter to $41.9 million, with an operating margin of 15%. Organic operating margin for the quarter was 16% as compared to 15% in the prior year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $42.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7%. As Jeff mentioned the integration of the GE Hydraulic Actuation business is progressing well and we are tracking ahead of our synergy realization plan. As expected their margins were diluted to the segment's margin in the quarter but we continue to develop and execute on plans which will drive segment average margins from this business in the mid-term. 
The Aftermarket Services segment, revenues in the third quarter were $80.7 million compared to $69.6 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16% reflecting 7% organic growth and the impact of Triumph Aviation Services- NAAS division acquisitions completed earlier in the quarter. Third quarter operating income increased 34% over the prior year quarter to $12.5 million with an operating margin of 15.5%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $14.8 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.4%. Even with the continued softness in the military aftermarket we have continued to drive strong margins in this segment and anticipate holding margins at Q3 levels for the balance of the year. 
During the quarter we repurchased roughly 336,000 shares for approximately $21.6 million. As of December 31, approximately 3.5 million shares remained under the share repurchase authorization and we will continue to tactically repurchase shares as part of our balanced approach to capital deployment and managing our overall liquidity position.

Moving on, on the pension front, we’ve included for your reference a Pension/OPEB Analysis for Triumph Aerostructures for the fiscal years 2014 and '15, which remains unchanged from last quarter. As we said last quarter we did complete an initial analysis of the impact of a required incorporation of new mortality tables to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans and based on this initial analysis we project approximately a 9% increase in the pension and OPEB liability as of March 31, 2015. 
We only expect minimal impact to our fiscal year ‘15 earnings and anticipate seeing a slight year-over-year earnings improvement related to our pension benefit, as we look forward to fiscal year ‘16 although not at the same levels as we would have previously estimated prior to the incorporation of the new mortality tables. These calculations are highly dependent on a number of factors such as year-end discount rates and loss amortization methodology and will be finalized as part of our fiscal year end valuation process. As mentioned in 747-8 discussion we’ve captured in the forward-loss that portion of the mortality table change impact that would be applied to the 747-8 program. 
Turning now to backlog, our order backlog as of December 31 was $4.8 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year. Keep in mind that our backlog takes into consideration only those firm orders that we are going to deliver over the next 24 months and primarily reflects future sales within our Aerostructures and Aerospace Systems groups. The aftermarket services group did not have a substantial backlog. Military represented approximately 23% of our backlog. 
For your reference we have included the top ten programs by backlog for both the Aerostructures and Aerospace System segments. You will note that with the inclusion of the backlog required with the G650 and G280 programs the Gulfstream programs in the aggregate are now the top programs in the Aerostructures segment. 
Boeing remained our only customer to exceed 10% of total revenue. Net sales to Boeing commercial military and space totaled 42.8% of our revenue and was broken down 76% commercial and 24% military. For your reference we have included in the appendix, charts reflecting sales by market and sales trends. 
Turning now to the balance sheet for the nine months ended December 31st we generated $365.9 million of cash flow from operations before pension contributions of $55.9 million. After these contributions cash flow from operations was $310 million. This does not include the receipt of $160 million from Spirit related to the transfer of Gulfstream G650 and G280 programs.
Inventory at December 31 reflected an increase of $178.6 million, during our first three quarters of the year of which approximately $117.9 million was attributable to non-recurring investments in the Bombardier and Embraer programs and $121.9 million was attributable to the acquisition of the GE Hydraulic Actuation business, Triumph Aviation Services- NAAS division and the Gulfstream G650 and G280 programs.
Capital spending was $26.1 million in the quarter, and $85.2 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital spending for the fiscal year to be in the range of $120 to $140 million. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion, representing 38.3% of total capital and total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBIDTA was 3.48 times. 
The global effective tax rate for the quarter reflected the fact that the R&D tax credit was retroactively reinstated back to January 1, 2014. In addition, the effective income tax rate for the quarter further reduced by implementation of state and global tax planning initiatives. From a cash tax perspective we currently expect minimal cash to be paid in fiscal 2015. 

The Q4 effective tax rate will be 35.2% and reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit expired at December 31 2014. In terms of financial guidance, based on current projected aircraft production rates we now expect our fiscal year revenue to be approximately $3.9 billion and Q4 earnings per share to be approximately $1.70 per diluted share, which excludes Red Oak facility transition cost and is based on a weighted average share count of 50.6 million shares. We now project our Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $165 million, excluding the non-recurring cost associated with the Red Oak facility transition. 
We expect to generate free cash flow available for debt reduction share repurchase and acquisitions for the fiscal year of approximately $300 million, which represents the incorporation of the cash used on the G650 and G280 programs in the fourth quarter and the impact of the 747-8 program. This does not include the $160 million received related to Gulfstream programs in Tulsa.
We have reduced overall earnings guidance to reflect a number of factors impacting our full year results to include delays in completing deliveries of the C17 program, lower production rates on certain commercial programs, continued softness in military aftermarket and the timing of resolution of certain non-recurring claims with customers. And we have incorporated the projected impact of the G650 and G280 wing programs which positively impact earnings per share, but are currently a drag on adjusted EBITDA and cash.
We are currently in the mist of the planning process for fiscal year 2016, but are not yet prepare to provide full guidance. While we are still confidence in the long term top and bottom line growth opportunity for this business, we would generally expect fiscal 2016 to be a transition year, with production ending and the C17 program, rate reductions on 747-8 and A330 programs and continued uncertainty in the military aftermarket, being offset by the incorporation of the G650 and G280 wing programs and the ramp on recent wins on the A320 and A350 programs, while we also complete development efforts and begin initial deliveries on the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 and Embraer E2 Jet programs.
Overall I expect the top line to reflect a 1% to 2% growth year-over-year, excluding any benefits associated with future acquisitions. While the bottom line will reflect margin expansion driven by the full year benefit related to the Red Oak facility, continued synergy realization on recent acquisition and capturing benefits associated with a number of improvement initiatives. We continue to see the business generating positive cash in fiscal 2016 although it will be muted from previous expectations driven by the outflows required on the G650 and G280 wings and then lower performance expectations on 747-8 program.
We do plan on providing a detailed view of fiscal year 2016 guidance as part of our fourth quarter’s earnings release. And with that I'll turn it back over to Jeff.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Thank you, Jeff. In terms of the outlook for the balance of the fiscal year and I know Jeff just went over this in great detail, I’d just like to accentuate a few things. We have a strong backlog and continue to win new contracts on key growth programs. We remain focused on execution, increasing profitability, expanding our margins and generating strong cash flow. Our financial guidance is as Jeff just outlined and that is that our revenue is expected to now be approximately $3.9 billion and the quarterly EPS were approximately a $1.70 per diluted share, is something that we've just laid out this number. But I think that you can understand that a number like this indicates that we still have a great deal of confidence in our ability to deliver results. $1.70 would be in fact a very solid quarter and we remain confident in our ability to do so. 

Then as both Jeff and I have stated we are absolutely committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to drive growth in the near and the mid-term. So at this time I'd like to open the phone lines to answer any questions you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions]. Sam Pearlstein, please state your affiliation followed by your question.
Samuel Pearlstein
Wells Fargo. Good morning guys. 
Jeffry D. Frisby 
Good morning Sam. 
Samuel Pearlstein
747 in the past you've talked about we were 25 -- quarter turn or half a turn it would be $30 million or $60 million. So this is obviously larger. So just, I mean are you assuming an even lower rate as you go out to 2019 or what are you doing differently than you had in the past when you provided that estimate? 
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, Sam I mean we are assuming a level of rate volatility on 747 as we look forward. Boeing has announced going to 1.3. In our analysis we think we’ve fully covered any future rate volatility we would see on this program. And as we step back and look at what the magnitude of rate reduction would be, it caused us also take to look back at what other impacts that there is potential risk on. And we try to provide for those in this analysis. So the primary area being in the assumption of where our labor performance and overall cost performance will be on this program through the end. And as I mentioned we still have four years of production in front of us and I think what we have done now is taken kind of a more risk adjusted approach of viewing where we think we are in this program through the end. 
Samuel Pearlstein
Okay, and then just on the cash flow, I know in the past you talked about $300 million to $325 million on an ongoing basis. You said it's lower than that because of the 747 and the Gulfstream program. But is there any way to size the magnitude of that reduction and how long until you get back on to that kind of a track of $300 million or so. 
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, what I would say and as it relates specifically to the G-650 and G-280, we still see ourselves turning those programs on a net basis cash positive by the end of fiscal year 2018. We know the cash drain early on will be higher and it will wane as we go through the first three years. As we think of the first quarter of operation, I would look at that being the highest use of cash. It is also hurt by the fact that we did not receive receivables as part of the transaction. So there is a delay in beginning receipts from customers. As we go through -- at fiscal year '16 I would expect the cash use to wane and continue to wane as we get through the end of fiscal year '18 where we still stay within the balance of the $160 million we've received on the program. 
On 747-8, as we look at the forward loss we have to keep in mind that the cash related to that forward loss is still in front of us and it's very much backend loaded to roughly two-thirds of the cash would hit us in fiscal year '18 and '19, which is driven by price breaks we have on the last lot under contract. So as you feather those two things in there the timing of those are a little different but it really creates a greater drain as we think of fiscal '16, '17, '18 than what we have previously would have anticipated. 
And as we talked in the past as we look forward, the other significant headwind that we still have when we begin getting out into fiscal '17 and '18 is we will become a cash tax payer. So we currently still project zero cash tax in fiscal '15, roughly 10% cash tax in fiscal '16, becoming a full tax cash payer in fiscal '17 and beyond which we believe is a rate roughly 28% to 30% in those years. 
Samuel Pearlstein
Okay, thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. Steven Cahall, please state your affiliation followed by your question. 

Steven Cahall
Yeah, thank you, from Royal Bank of Canada. Good morning. 
Jeffry D. Frisby
Good morning. 
Steven Cahall
Maybe just to follow up on the 747 program, first I was wondering as we take a look at this I'm guessing that kind of the big unknown-unknown here is the revised labor and cost estimate. So wondering if you can give a little bit more color as to how you come about sizing those and then you talked a lot about the ongoing productivity improvement and what sort of the risk and opportunity is there as we think about this long-term estimate?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, I mean as we proceed on those programs we have historically assumed a certain level of period over period improvements in the labor performance as well as the broader cost performance. As we looked at the EACs for the balance of the contract, we definitely flattened our expectation around performance. And most of that’s driven labor as well as overhead cost. 
We think that there is still opportunity we can drive improvement above what we projected but we thought this was the appropriate time to really scale back our expectation of improvement through the end of the contract. So I would say, I think we have at least bracketed the risk and are still striving to drive opportunity in 747-8. This also assumes that we produce through the end of the contract. As we’ve spoken in the past you know we are confident in Boeing’s ability to sell planes but as we sit here today they haven’t fully filled out the order book through the end of our contract. If they want -- they were to end the program before the end of the contract there be some claw back of this loss. I would say that the risk at that point would be then around any facility shut down impacts that we would have to factor in.
Steven Cahall
Okay, that’s helpful. And then on -- if we think about this sort cascading to where we are on the A330, how would you couch that program in comparison to the 747? Airbus has certainly suggested that rates are coming down but could come down further. So how does that program sit versus where you are on 747?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, completely different dynamics on 330. You know 330 is built in facilities with a number of other programs. So the magnitude of impact when we see rate reductions isn’t the same as we see on 47 where they are pretty much in dedicated type facilities. As we have looked at projections on 330 we have built in the rate reduction expectation that Airbus has already communicated and as we build business plans without firm direction from Airbus on rate reductions we have assumed continued step down in rates as we get out beyond fiscal ’16, as a transition to Neo. 
I would say our current margin expectation on 330 comes down a little bit at lower rates but it isn’t to the same magnitude that we are dealing with here on 747.
Jeffry D. Frisby
And I think another key difference in looking at a go forward view of 47 and 330 is that if in fact we identified a particular level of capital investment that we might make in order to drive costs down the run rate, the quantity of the aircraft in front of us on A330 is fundamentally different, in fact can provide a business case that can help us drive costs down and pay for those things. 47 is not necessarily -- does not necessarily have that luxury. So it is two totally different scenarios.
Steven Cahall
And the 777 looks more like the 330 or the 747?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah, I would say the general dynamics on 777 would look like 330, correct.
Steven Cahall
So, it’s not in a dedicated facility like 747?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Correct, definitely amount. Yeah, 747 is really the one anomaly where it resides in two, they are not fully dedicated but it’s you know 90% of the work load in the facilities.
Steven Cahall

Thank you. I will get back in the queue.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Thanks, Steve.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from Myles Walton. Please state your affiliation and your question.
Myles Walton
Deutsche Bank, thanks, good morning.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Good morning.
Myles Walton
I think Jeff McRae you had previously had a $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion cash projection for the five year '15 going forward. I think Gulfstream programs are it would seem $160 million negative to that after tax ahead of the 747 hit $100 million. So are we now looking at $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion or is the range even lower than that. 
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, I mean at a macro level and I haven't run out updated cash flows for five years, Myles. But on a macro level I think those are the two key impacts that we're looking at. And I would say Jeff and I are still very optimistic with some of the other things we're doing in the business that we'll be able to recover that cash by driving improvements and taking cost out of the overall structure within Triumph. 
Myles Walton
The mortality assumption hit on the 747 rather what -- that you had here in the quarter, is that triggered by the rate decision and should we expect it to roll through the rest of the portfolio at year end. 
Jeffrey L. McRae
So what happens on 747, because we're in a forward loss position, it really what it’s doing is pulling forward the change that we anticipate in the next four years from our previous projection on pension benefit to our current projection on pension benefit. So it really is magnifying that impact as we pull it forward in to 747. We still anticipate some year-over-year growth in pension benefit as we move forward. It's just not at the same magnitude that it would have been previously before in corporation in the tables. So I think the impact on other programs it bleeds in slower because those are still in positive positions and they tend just to be seeing the impact of a single year versus this situation where 47’s pulling in four years of that delta. 
Myles Walton
Okay and then this question is kind of the high level, it ties the cash back to the portfolio. Jeff Frisby, you've had challenges in the Aerostructures, realistically you'll continue to over the next few years look challenges and execution opportunities on the Aerostructures, Aerosystems and aftersystems business don't seem to be encumbered by the same dynamics. What if anything would require you to think about breaking the two, and also are the two kind of cash independent at this points, that is the next five year projection would both be able to function into their projected cash flow streams independently. 
Jeffry D. Frisby
Well, the company operates as one, really. And I would say that the opportunities that are in front of us as they relate to the Aerostructures business are still available to us in the systems business as well. Some of the initiatives that we are working on are going to benefit the entire enterprise. So it's going to -- it's one of those things that yeah we've got some difficulty in trying to drive margins back up to an acceptable level in Aerostructures and we're working on those issues and we'll succeed to doing so. 
But it doesn't mean that those same initiatives won't take margins in our systems and aftermarket businesses in fact improve those as well. So I think that it's not a tale of two companies here. We have one company and a lot of our success, comes from the fact that we gain a lot of benefit from leverage we can bring across being a $4 billion company. So that really can't be minimized. So I'm not sure if I captured all of the aspects of your question, so whatever I missed if you want to re-ask I will be happy.
Myles Walton
Yeah, I mean it does look like that certainly the underlying organic differences are materially different. You provide the top 10 programs and you can see it in the portfolio manifestation. So it does seem divergent, certainly challenges. And then on the cash side, I guess the other point to the question was, is Aerostructures kind of in need of the cash venerability of Aerosystems I'm sorry Aerospace Systems and aftermarket at this point?

Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah Myles, I don't think there is great distortion as we look long-term in this business between the segments from a cash generation and deployment. Obviously with investments required on development programs in the structures world it tends to be larger investments within the longer term returns on those investments. So you get a little more lumpiness but we don't view this business as the deployment or generation of cash in systems and aftermarket and just go in to fund Structures or vice versa and long term I don’t see a great disparity there.
Myles Walton
Okay, thanks.

Thank you and our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu. Please say your affiliation and your question. 
Sheila Kahyaoglu
Great, thanks, it’s Jefferies. Good morning.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Just to follow up on Steve’s question a bit, how do you get the investment community comfortable that whether it’s the 747 or the A330 that this is sort of one of the biggest charge and what changed between today and looking back to September 2013, in terms of cost on the 747 and head count. Can you may be talk about production rate is difficult I understand but maybe some of the changes that you’ve made?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, I mean as we think 747 from the impacts we saw going back over a year ago, a lot of the impact that we realized over a year ago although it related to performance within our shop it was also recognition of the impact of the broader supply chain on the 747 program, a lot of disruption from my quality and delivery standpoint where we were not meeting the expectations of our customers. There was a lot of expedited freight type of cost that we were incurring at that point in time. I would say, as we sit here today and we’ve talked about the forward loss we are now taking, we are back on schedule with the customer, the quality continues to improve in the product we are delivering, the performance has improved overtime, it hasn’t been at the rate that we would like to have seen it improve at, but I would say overall the 747 program is much more stable that it was a year ago. 
The variable is as Boeing reduces rates and potentially as we look in the future, at future rate reductions, that has a significant impact on 47 because of how it’s produced and where it’s produced in dedicated facilities where we don’t have the luxury of being able to take as much cost out, as we see from the impact in lower revenue coming in on the program. From a risk standpoint and I tried to talk about it with Steve’s question we think we have bracketed what is a reasonable expectation, looking forward on this program and have fully provided for what we believe would be the impacts of future rate variability as well as a much lower expectation from a performance standpoint. 
I am never going to say never, especially on this program but I think we, in this charge have attempted to put our arms fully around what we think is in front of us and we think as we look at driving improvement and tracking opportunities we see on this program this is weighted more so towards opportunities then future risks. 
Jeffry D. Frisby
And the important statement has already been made that the 747 is a unique program in our company and that it is the only program that has effectively dedicated facilities. We’ve always stated that Triumph is far more flexible and resilient in face of rate cuts because of our facilities not being dedicated to individual programs. The 747 is alone in being the exception to that rule and while certainly rate cuts will affect us in some way as they affect most manufactures we in fact will not experience the same kind of impact on other programs as we mentioned in our answer to Steve’s question. 

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Got it. Thank you. That’s very helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow-up how do you think about normalized margins within structures going forward?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, I mean you are going to have revenue on 747 going forward and as we look at through the end of the contract we still have roughly $1.1 billion of revenue on that contract that will flow through the P&L, that will flow through the P&L at 0% percent margin. So obviously that is dilutive to margins in the Aerostructure segment. When we exclude the 747 from Aerostructures we still see ourselves operating with operating margins in the mid-teens and we think that, that is sustainable. We will see some impact as the Bombardier 7000/8000 program ramps up as well Embraer E-Jets because our expectation with those would be at a lower then segment margin in their first accounting blocks, and would grow to above segment margins as we proceed through accounting blocks. 
So we will have some of that dynamic in structures but I still it’s reasonable to look at that business being a mid-teen operating margin business as we look forward, excluding 747.
Sheila Kahyaoglu
Thanks 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr. Please state your name and your affiliation -- I am sorry your affiliation and your question. [Operator Instructions]. Okay. Are there any additional questions? Looks like our next question is from Kevin Ciabattoni. Please state your affiliation and your question. 
Jeffry D. Frisby
She’s not part of the Triumph [ph]. Operator, is there other questions in the queue, maybe we can move on and circle back to Cai and Kevin.
Operator
Sure, okay. Just one moment. Looks like our next question is from Steve Levenson. Please state your affiliation and your question.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Okay, it seems a common theme here.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Try to get this fixed.
Operator
Okay, I am just going to look into this, if everyone could please hold for just one moment. Thank you. Once again our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu. Please state your affiliation and your question. Let’s try Kevin Ciabattoni. Please state your affiliation and your question.
Kevin Ciabattoni
Hi, can you hear me?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah, we sure can, Kevin.
Kevin Ciabattoni
All right, great. KeyBanc, thanks.
Jeffry D. Frisby
And we apologize if we were accusing you of not coming off of mute. I think there was a technical difficulty here. 
Kevin Ciabattoni
I figured, thanks. So my first question, real quick I just want to touch on the free cash flow. I think you've mentioned expectations for next year are a little bit muted relative to your prior thoughts. Is that including the $160 million that you guys received from Spirit as part of the Gulfstream package or are we…?
Jeffrey L. McRae
No, I mean what we have done with that 160 as we think of free cash flow, we've excluded that 160 from that equation. So as I think of fiscal '16 my comment really is muted around the known outflows will have on the Tulsa programs as well as the impact with the lower expectations on 47-8. 
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay perfect, that's helpful. And then just want to look at aftermarket a little bit. You saw 7% organic growth there. Just wondering if you could give us some color on what you're seeing in that market. And then on the military side it sounded like you're expecting things to pick-up into the back half of this year, looking at last quarter and now it sounds like maybe that's not the case. Just wondering what's changed there. 
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah I mean what we're seeing in the aftermarket services segment is most of the organic growth is coming on the commercial side. So we're still seeing the same, what I just take as pent-up demand on the military side that we keep expecting to free up. When I talked to our aftermarket companies they talked with a level of frustration because they can see the product, they have customers on the military side, expressing that funding will be coming and things keep getting pushed out. It's not clear to us if it's budget constraints or other factors there, but even with that softness we have seen very strong performance within our aftermarket services businesses but most of it's being driven by commercial work as opposed to military. 

Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay that's helpful. And then last one from me. Maybe if you guys could provide us with any kind of specific changes that occurred at Red Oak through the quarter in terms of the progress there, and then any potential for further footprint consolidation as we look into fiscal '16, '17? 
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah I mean Red Oak, specifically I would say as we sit here today we have achieved getting back to expected performance levels on most programs. There are a couple of outliers that we were closed on just not there yet. C-17 and I talked to really is one anomaly there where primarily because of it coming to its end of production, we've been experiencing a number of shortages within the supply chain. And that's both our supply chain as well as customer furnished product, which has really impacted performance there and has impacted our ability to complete the program here in the fourth quarter. So we will see revenue slippage in to fiscal '16. 
But we continue to monitor the performance at Red Oak on a regular basis and have been very pleased with what we're seeing there. I think all of the kind of instability early on with the workforce has worked its way through. And they're starting to really hit on all cylinders. It's also where we are building the wing for the Bombardier Global 7000 and the team there did get out the first wing to Bombardier at the end of December. And we'll continue to ramp up that program as we look forward in Red Oak as well. We've also made a decision to produce the fuselage segments for the Embraer E-Jet programs in Red Oak and that activity will be ramping up as we look into fiscal '16 and fiscal '17 as well. 
Jeffrey L. McRae
And in terms of footprints consolidation, that just one aspect of what we're currently reviewing and the reason I say that is that while some footprint consolidation just make sense and we have in fact accomplished some of that in this fiscal year and we are continuing to implement the footprint consolidations, such as consolidating our two Long Island manufacturing facilities into one. 
There are still is an opportunity I think to expand what we are doing. In other words reducing our footprints only makes sense if in fact we have underutilized capacity that we really have nothing to do with and with the acquisition of the Tulsa wing program we have a fair amount of opportunity to drive additional vertical value through the value stream. So those decisions that we may have made six months ago may not make sense now with the additional value that we can drive through a far more fully utilized facility. 
That said I’ll go back to the flip side of that and we are continuing to look at where our long-term footprint focus needs to be in terms of being competitive in all of our segments. So this is a subject that we are acting on now. We are looking at -- we are in the process of acting on projects that will run through ‘16 and it’s an area of focus for us not only in ‘16 but also what is the long-term industrialization strategy of the company. 
Kevin Ciabattoni
Okay, great. Thank you guys. 
Operator
Thank you and our next question is from Steve Levenson.
Stephen E. Levenson
Thanks, Good morning. Can you hear me?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Hi, Steve.
Stephen E. Levenson
Okay, great thank you. On the cash received as part of the G280-G650 transaction, are there any restrictions or can you use it you please?
Jeffrey L. McRae
We can use it as we please. I mean as we review we received it on the 30th of December. It went in and reduced the outstanding revolver we had at that point in time. But it, it goes into the bucket of deployment from looking at opportunities, both organically and inorganically and share repurchase. 
Stephen E. Levenson
Got it, thank you. Separately can you give us a little more information on the Global 7000/8000 when you get some relief on that inventory and can you just give us some idea of how the E2-Jet schedule looks?

Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah, so I mean we have delivered the first test articles on the Global 7000/8000. Most of the deliveries that we have in fiscal ‘16 are additional test articles going to Bombardier. We would expect to start seeing revenue units on Global 7000/8000 by the end of fiscal ‘16 but really so ramping up in fiscal ’17, when we start delivering revenue units is when we start liquidating the development cost on that. It’s also when the payments related to development costs flow in, the initial few hundred units on that program. 
On Embraer you can generally think of being roughly nine to12 months behind that schedule that we’ve talked to on Bombardier, we will start delivering test units in mid-fiscal ‘16 but wouldn’t really start seeing revenues until the end of fiscal ‘17 and really ramping up then in fiscal ‘18. 
Stephen E. Levenson
Okay, thanks. Last one is how much more inventory -- what additions do you think there will be on the Global 7000/8000 program?
Jeffry D. Frisby
So we are effective -- but we are not yet done with the development from an engineering stand point but we are closing in on it. So I would expect by the end of this fiscal year, early fiscal year ‘16 that the engineering activity will be concluded. We would always expect some level of ongoing activity just as we continue to optimize within the build and design. So most of ‘16 though is that investment in the test articles. I would generally look at the investment required in Bombardier in fiscal ‘16 to be roughly half of what we’ve seen in the fiscal ‘15. 
Stephen E. Levenson
Okay, thank you very much. 
Operator
[Operator Instruction]. And our next question is from Cai von Rumohr. Please state your affiliation and your question. 
Unidentified Analyst
It’s Lucy dialing in for Cai from Cowen and Company. Can you hear me okay?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah, Lucy. 
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, so just following-up on the previous question, I am in interested in learning about cash requirements on new programs. In the past you have talked about $120 million or so for the Global 7000/8,000 and the E2. Where does that sit today and given it sounds like you are on track for scheduling in cost for those programs?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yeah, so if you look at spending today in fiscal ’15 we are slightly under that $120 million mark. I still expect full year spending on Global 7000/8000 and Embraer to be in the $120 million to $140 million range. I would expect that to diminish significantly as we move into fiscal year ’16 where I would look at probably roughly half of that spend in fiscal year ’16.
Unidentified Analyst
Right. And I may have missed this earlier; you talked about continued softness in military aftermarket. Are you expecting that to get better at any point maybe next year?
Jeffry D. Frisby
You know we have continued to expect improvement there. We have in our mind pushed out that improvement into fiscal ’16. So I wouldn’t expect much improvement in the fourth quarter of ’15 but we are still optimistic we will see spending come back as we go into fiscal year ’16.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yeah, that said the commercial side of that aftermarket business it remains robust at this time.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, thank you.

Jeffry D. Frisby
Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I want to add my welcome to the Triumph Group first quarter fiscal year '15 conference call. I'll take this opportunity to remind you that there is a slide presentation available for your viewing in addition to the audio portion.
Before I get into the slide deck, I want to make a few remarks. Many of you attended, either in person or by telephone, our Investor Day that we held in New York City on June 11. The theme of that day was that the Triumph was designed to be different, built to perform and positioned for growth. For the first time, we shared not only short-term guidance, but our long-term vision as well, long-term strategic plan that we have been executing for the past 2 years. We shared how, through the rest of this decade, we're going to mold our company into a more balanced enterprise in terms of segments, customers and programs, characterized by a focus on execution at all levels, leading to a predictable 8% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth and 15% year-over-year growth in earnings per share.
In the 7 weeks since we last spoke, we have made good progress on several fronts and have been benefited by a key customer decision. Shortly after Investor Day, we settled all pending litigation with Eaton, ending a 10-year legal battle and freeing us from the distractions associated with this type of activity.
Just prior to the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the GE Hydraulic Systems businesses located in Yakima, Washington; Cheltenham, U.K.; Isle of Man; and Suzhou, China. We completed the first quarter with results slightly better than our June 11 guidance, and then were gratified to learn at the recent airshow in Farnborough, the Airbus had decided to launch the A330neo, effectively lengthening the production life of this important airframe well into the next decade.

Each of these accomplishments and milestones is important individually. But together, they provide us with solid momentum heading into the balance of our fiscal year and beyond. We'll get into more detail on some of these issues shortly.
There's one last item I'd like to cover before I get into the slides. There have been many questions asked and there has been much speculation around Triumph Group's interest in, and intentions towards certain assets owned by Spirit AeroSystems in Tulsa. I want to make a statement that will serve as the sum total of what we will say on this subject at this time. And we have long stated that we would have an interest in certain pieces of Spirit's Gulf Tulsa business, specifically the Gulfstream wings, should they become available. We have also long stated, since win-win agreements are hard to reach, that win-win, win-win agreements are far more complex and more difficult to achieve. That being said, we still have interest in reaching such an agreement if possible. And we will let you all know if and when we have something to report.
All right, then at that. Let's turn to Page 3 titled Q1 In Review. As I've mentioned, our first quarter results came in as expected. We had a solid start to our fiscal year. We're slightly above the upper end of our Investor Day guidance. In our Aerostructures segment, we had a solid quarter in spite of our lower 747-8 and 767 program revenue and the shifting of several C-17 shipments to quarter 2, which was also mentioned at Investor Day. And importantly, the 747-8 program is on track.
In terms of Aerospace Systems, organic sales were impacted by production rate cuts on V-22 program and decrease in military sales, but we had continued good performance at Triumph Engine Control Systems as well as other companies in the group.
Our Aftermarket Services business was down revenue-wise, but we had continued strength in operating margin performance despite military aftermarket weakness. I should add that we remain confident that this segment will recover well as the year progresses.
We successfully completed the acquisition of the Hydraulic Actuation businesses of GE, as I mentioned earlier, and we are excited about and we have high hopes for this acquisition. As we speak, efforts are underway to make the kind of improvements necessary to achieve the margin potential this business has.
GE operated this business in 4 locations, and as part of the agreement, we will be moving out of some shared facilities and will be able to achieve some benefit from consolidating footprint.
This business is also virtually, entirely proprietary in nature, and as such, should have a more vibrant aftermarket presence than they do. We are clearly executing plans to take greater advantage of this position.
Thirdly, as in the case of engine control systems, this company was, and I'll use the term, saddled with contracts that provided parent company benefit, but were in varying degrees detrimental to the individual site. And we're in the process of shifting course relative to these contracts. Now these efforts, among others, plus the natural lift you get from a large dose of autonomy and support, will add up to a very successful addition to our Aerospace Systems segment.
As I mentioned earlier, we settled all pending litigation with Eaton, and we received $135.3 million in cash. There's not much more to say about this, it's over. We received their payment and now we can focus on winning more business.
As you know, we successfully completed the refinancing of the high-yield debt due 2018, providing us some important interest reductions. And we executed a 750,000 share buyback for approximately $51 million and effectively repurchased an additional 284,000 shares when we redeemed our convertible notes.

I'll be back to address our outlook shortly, but I will now hand over to Jeff McRae. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a review of the financial results for the first quarter.
Turning first to the income statement. Sales for the first quarter were $896.9 million compared to $943.7 million for the prior-year period, a decrease of 5%. Operating income for the quarter increased 70% to $240.5 million and included $8.7 million of costs related to the Jefferson Street/Red Oak facility transition. And $134.7 million of settlement gain net of legal fees related to the Eaton litigation.
Excluding these nonrecurring items, operating margin was 12.8% for the quarter. The prior year's first quarter included approximately $3.5 million of nonrecurring costs related to the Jefferson Street move. Excluding these costs, operating margin was 15.4% for the prior year's first quarter.
Net income was $128.2 million, resulting in earnings per share of $2.46 per diluted share versus $1.50 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring items for both periods, net income was $62.1 million or $1.19 per diluted share versus $81.4 million or $1.54 per diluted share for the prior year's quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the net settlement gain was $134.4 million, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.1%. The number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 52.1 million shares.
Now looking at our segment performance. Sales in the Aerostructures segment for the first quarter declined 6% to $611.9 million, primarily due to the production rate cuts in the 747-8 program, whereas we were still at 2 ship sets per month in Q1 '14. Lower revenues in the 767 program and the shifting of several C-17 shipments into the second quarter. First quarter operating income was $70.9 million compared to $100.4 million for the prior-year period, and included $8.7 million of pretax charges related to the Red Oak facility transition. Most of this is cost that was incurred in fiscal year '14 that is embedded in block accounting. Although we did incur some additional cost in the quarter related to the cleanup and disposal efforts at the Jefferson Street facility. We also saw a net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment of $700,000. The segment's operating margin for the quarter was 11.6%. Excluding the Red Oak facility transition cost, the segment's operating margin was 13%. EBITDA for the quarter was $90.7 million with an EBITDA margin of 15%.
We continue to make good progress in ramping up production at Red Oak and anticipate being fully back on schedule and recover the pre-production performance levels on all programs by the middle of the fiscal year. The overall Red Oak business case continues to hold in line with previous guidance. As we move through the year, we will see segment margin enhancement driven by Red Oak as we get into accounting blocks that are being fully executed in Red Oak in FY '15 and beyond.
As Jeff mentioned, we also saw a continued stabilization in our 747-8 program in line with our expectations, which has allowed us to maintain a low single-digit margin on the current accounting block. Our margin calculation is based on the assumption that we maintain a production rate of 1.5 ship sets per month.
We also continued to make progress with the development of the wing for the Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000, and are on track to deliver the initial wings in support of the development effort this fiscal year.
The rudder, elevator and fuselage sections of the Embraer E-jet are also on track, and we anticipate making initial deliveries on those during the first half of fiscal year 2016. We incurred $34.5 million of development cost on these programs during the quarter.

Moving onto Aerospace Systems. Sales in this segment were $219.9 million, basically, flat compared to the prior year's quarter. Organic sales for the quarter declined 5%, primarily due to production rate cuts on the V-22 program and overall lower military sales.
First quarter operating income decreased 12% from the prior year quarter to $37.4 million with an operating margin of 17%. EBITDA for the quarter was $43 million at an EBITDA margin of 19.9%. And as Jeff mentioned, we did complete the acquisition of the GE Hydraulic Actuation Business at the end of the first fiscal quarter. The financial statements had incorporated a preliminary opening balance sheet for this business, while there was no material impact on the income statement due to the timing of the closing of the transaction. We still project this business to be immediately accretive, contributing approximately $0.07 to our FY '15 earnings per share, while it will be neutral from a cash generation standpoint, as we make investments to consolidate the overall footprint of the business, as we work to consolidate the European elements into our existing actuation and motion control business in the U.K.
We expect to drive segment average margins from this business in the midterm, and we will see positive cash generation and EBITDA in FY '16, consistent with our expectations.
Excluding the impact of GE, we anticipate improved margins in this segment during the balance of FY '15, driven by aftermarket, which was light in the first quarter in the segment.
Moving to Aftermarket Services. Segment revenues here in the first quarter were $67.6 million, compared to $74.4 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease reflected the timing of completion of certain contracts and continued softness in the military aftermarket. First quarter operating income decreased 7% over the prior year quarter to $10.5 million with an operating margin of 15.5%. EBITDA for the quarter was $12.4 million with an EBITDA margin of 18.3%.
On the commercial side of our Aftermarket segment, we have seen an increase in the pace of opportunities, which will drive a level of recovery in this segment, although weighted to the second half of the fiscal year and offsetting some of the softness we are seeing in the military aftermarket. We anticipate holding margins at Q1 levels in this segment for the balance of the year, with some opportunities for improvement driven by product mix.
As Jeff mentioned, during the quarter, with did repurchase 750,000 shares for approximately $51 million and effectively repurchased some additional 284,000 shares with a redemption of our convertible notes, bringing the total number of shares repurchased or effectively repurchased to 1,334,000 shares. We will continue to tactically repurchase shares as part of a balanced approach to capital deployment and managing our overall liquidity position.
For your reference, we have included a Pension/OPEB analysis for Triumph Aerostructures, which remains in line with our previous disclosures. During the quarter, we did contribute $45 million to the pension plan in line with our fiscal year assumptions.
Turning now to backlog. Our backlog take into consideration only those firm orders that we are going to deliver over the next 24 months and primarily reflects future sales within our Aerostructures and Aerospace Systems groups. The Aftermarket Services group does not have a substantial backlog. Our order backlog as of June 30, was just over $5 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year and did include the incorporation of approximately $230 million of backlog held by the GE Hydraulic Actuation business, which significantly improved our position on the Boeing 787 program and the Airbus A320 and A380 programs.

Same-store backlog increased 1% sequentially and 1% from the prior year. Military represented approximately 26% of our total backlog.
Boeing remained our only customer to exceed 10% of total revenue. Net sales to Boeing commercial mil -- and military and space totaled 42.6% of our revenue and it was broken down 68% commercial and 32% military. For your reference, we have included in the appendix charts reflecting sales by market and sales trends.
Now turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we did utilize $6.8 million of cash flow from operations before pension contributions of $45.2 million. Inventory for the quarter increased $90.4 million, of which approximately $34.5 million was attributable to nonrecurring investment in the Bombardier and Embraer programs and $48 million was related to the GE acquisition.
We also ended the quarter with a significantly elevated level of accounts receivable, which included $135.3 million related to the Eaton settlement, $26 million related to a tax refund due to the completion of the IRX -- IRS examination of our NOL carryback claim, and $15 million related to the closure of a claim from a prior acquisition. These 3 payments have all been received in July.
CapEx in the quarter was $23.1 million, and we continue to project CapEx for the year to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, and expect nonrecurring investment in major programs to be approximately $120 million for the year.
Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.7 billion, a $211 million increase from the end of the previous quarter, reflecting cash use of $51 million to repurchase shares; $65 million to fund the acquisition of the GE hydraulic business; $35 million used to fund the call premiums related to the 2018 higher notes and the convertible debt, as well as financing fees on the new debt issuance; and $45 million in pension contributions.
Net debt represented 42.4% of total capital, and total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 3.4x.
Although ending the quarter over our targeted leverage position, we anticipate bringing this back within the targeted range over the next 2 quarters.
Based on current interest rates, we anticipate a quarterly interest expense including amortization of fees of between $16 million and $17 million for the balance of the fiscal year 2015. The global effective tax rate for the quarter was 36% and reflected the fact that the R&D tax credit expired in December 2013 and has not yet been renewed. In addition, the income tax expense for the quarter was reduced by approximately $1.4 million to reflect the additional tax benefit resulting from the completion of the IRS examination of our NOL carryback claim and the reversal of tax reserves.
From a cash tax perspective, we currently expect minimal cash tax to be paid in fiscal year 2015.
In terms of financial guidance, we are reaffirming our FY 2015 guidance based on current projected aircraft production rates and a weighted average share count of 51.6 million shares. We expect full year revenues to be $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion and earnings per share, excluding the nonrecurring items, to be $5.75 to $5.90 per share.
We have good visibility into our business given our backlog and the anticipated benefit from recent activities.
Regarding the quarterly flow of earnings, we expect to see strengthening the quarters as the year progresses, with greater weighting towards the second half of the fiscal year. Driving results will be the realization of the full benefit of the GE acquisition, the Red Oak facility transition, recent wins and the general seasonality of a number of our businesses, increase in the cadence of opportunities in the Aftermarket segment and realizing the full benefits of the share repurchase made to date. We expect that Q2 will be higher than Q1, contributing 23% to 25% of full year projected earnings, excluding nonrecurring items.

We continue to project our full year adjusted EBITDA to be $665 million to $680 million, which excludes the impact of the Eaton settlement and nonrecurring costs associated with the Red Oak transition. And we expect to generate free cash flow after pension contributions for the year of approximately $385 million, which has been increased to reflect the Eaton settlement.
A number of you have inquired recently about the potential impact of further reduction in the 747-8 program production rate. But we currently do not have any indication that production rates from the 747-8 will change. If Boeing were to direct us to reduce production rates on the program, which we believe would most likely take program to a rate of between 1 and 1.25 per month, it would have a negative impact on the profitability of the program. Although we do believe we'd be able to maintain a slight positive margin on the current accounting block, our greater impact would be on future accounting blocks for which we would be put into loss positions, forcing us to recognize those projected losses on a current basis.
Given this scenario, our current estimate of the impact would be a pretax charge of approximately $30 million to $60 million. Obviously, the impact is highly dependent on the level of rate reduction, as well as the duration of any rate reduction. We will continue to work with our customers and suppliers and are taking actions to improve our internal cost structure and performance to drive improved margins on these programs and mitigate the impact related to any potential rate reduction.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Jeff.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Thank you, Jeff. Turning to our outlook. We remain confident in our fiscal 2015 outlook. Our backlog remains strong. It's over $5 billion now. We will remain focused on execution, increasing profitability, expanding our margins and generating strong cash flow. Execution is still the key that unlocks our ability to grow even more quickly. We reaffirm our FY 2015 guidance based on the current projected aircraft production rates and our weighted average share count of 51.6 million shares; revenue of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion; earnings per share, excluding the items listed here, of $5.75 to $5.90 per share. And as both Jeff and I have already mentioned, it is weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year, with Q2 slightly higher than Q1.
Our adjusted EBITDA of $665 million to $680 million remains intact, and we should have cash available for debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchases of approximately $385 million. Although there are certainly challenges ahead, our future remains bright.
With that, I'd like to open up the phone lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Noah Poponak.
Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
This is Omear filling in for Noah. I believe you have noted in the past that the Red Oak cost-saving targets only incorporate tangible and visible achievable opportunities and that potential upside could exist from higher efficiency savings once the facility is live and in operation. Are you now able to better quantify or describe those potential opportunities for us possibly?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes, Omear. I would say we are still very confident in being able to achieve greater performance in what we built into our business case. We, as we said in our statements, see the facility getting back up and being back at the performance levels that we exited Jefferson Street at by the end of the second quarter, middle of the year. From that point forward, we would expect to be able to see continued performance improvements. I don't know that I would be in a position right now to start quantifying additional benefits above the $0.50 that we've previously communicated around Red Oak, but we definitely are -- continue to be optimistic of being able to drive additional performance improvements.

Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. And just a separate follow-up. Can you spend some time discussing your overall Airbus strategy. You have mentioned it a little bit
in your prepared remarks there. What type of content would you guys be potentially interested in, in going for on Airbus products going forward? Is it more on the systems side, more on the structure side or you guys have a preference or how are you guys thinking about that?
Jeffry D. Frisby
We're really aiming for profitable work on Airbus. And I actually, say that for a reason, there are an awful lot of companies, particularly due to the fragmented status of the Aerostructures business in Europe, there are an awful lot of companies in the business, not many of them making money. So we are looking for the right Aerostructures opportunity that fits our capabilities and allows us to perform in a way that will benefit not only Airbus, but ourselves. And we're also, at the same time, we're looking in and succeeding in achieving systems business wins as well. So one of the reasons we really were favorably viewing the GE acquisition. Because it had such a significant percentage of Airbus content on the actuation side. So it's a blend. I think that we're not really looking at one segment in preference to the other. But at the same time, Airbus is just one piece of our rebalancing strategy. They happen to be the one of the 2 of the duopolies in commercial aircraft production that we don't have as significant a presence in, so it becomes most prominent. But it's just one of our targeted customers that we are looking at in order to advance our cause of rebalancing our customers.
Operator
Our next question comes from Joe Nadol.
Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
It's Seth Seifman on for Joe this morning from JPMorgan. Just to dig in to the cash flow a little bit further. Thanks for the outline of the receivables. I just wanted to follow up last year, it seems like we have been waiting for a receivable from a large customer and receivables continue to increase through the second half of last year. And then you outlined what drove the increase in Q1 and that we should see that reversed. Is there a bigger reversal happening there? Did we see the receivable, I think, it was probably about $100 million from a major customer in the second half of last year. And it got drowned out by other increases? Or is there a bigger reversal of that receivable -- of that than what should lay out in Q1?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes, Seth. I think what you're referring to is at the end of Q3 '14, we had a significant deferral of payments related to a customer that would have cleared out in Q4 of FY '14. As we said at the end of Q1, I would say that there is a level of, I won't call it slow payments, but timing around payments that we would have hoped to have received in Q1 that are drifting into Q2. I wouldn't say it's a specific customer that we're concerned on there, it was just a general drifting on collections. So from a timing standpoint, I called out 3 large items that are sitting in that receivables balance at 6/30. Those have all been received. So the total of those is roughly $176 million that came in here in the first few weeks of July. I would say that we should see continued improvement quarter-over-quarter from a cash perspective in receivables, but it's nothing specific to call out.
Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And then I guess just in terms of getting to the guidance. Probably, work through it, but you could tell us a little bit about the receivables, about the investments in capitalized inventory, taxes, pension. Any other working capital adjustments to be aware of in terms of how you get to the guidance for the year?

Jeffrey L. McRae
No. I mean, in our guidance, we have built in a level of improvements from a working capital standpoint outside of the investments in the nonrecurring programs that are hitting inventory. Part of that improvement comes at we have -- we begin to see some additional offsets to the investments as we have milestone payments on those nonrecurring programs that will be inflows from customers, which helps us offset some of the impact there and ultimately, gets reflected as a net inventory balance. But we see opportunity broadly, primarily in inventory as we go through FY '15 to continue to drive down and see improvements that will drive some of that working capital that we're depicting.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Wells Fargo. Can you just help me, I mean, how should I think about the proceeds from the Eaton lawsuit? Should that go towards buyback or any other purpose? Just because I'm a little surprised, it doesn't look like you bought back much stocks since the Investor Day. Didn't know if you were blocked out for certain periods or how should we be thinking about that, the extra $135 million?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. I think there's a couple dynamics, Sam, that came into play in our mind. One, as we think of that $135 million, we view it in line with our broader capital and capital generation we're seeing in FY '15, and we'd look at a balanced approach to deployment of that capital. So I think we continue to see a very robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Obviously, we are also viewing share repurchase favorably as we look at where our share price is right now. As you think of activity, as we evaluated capital at the end of the first quarter, we knew we had allowed our leverage ratio to creep up with the share repurchase that we had completed with the expense we incurred with the takeout of the debt, and with the GE acquisition. As we looked at it, we felt comfortable at a leverage ratio of 3.4 and a debt to capital above 40%. We really do want to manage that into the target range on leverage of between 2x and 3x and really keep that debt to capitalization below 40%. So we really looked at it and balanced and didn't feel it appropriate to continue to extend ourselves in the first quarter. We also knew we were going to have a strong cash generation quarter in Q2, and we look at deployment of capital into 2Q pretty strongly.
Jeffry D. Frisby
And just a -- your other observation is right on. Since June 11, our Investor Day, we had about 2 days, I think, of -- even if we wanted to buy stock back until we entered a blackout period, which we're still in. So at that point, we could not act. So now we're in, as Jeff said, we're in a position that if, in fact, we think it's the right opportunity, we'll have the ability to participate.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. That's great. And then just on some of the adjustments between the adjusted EPS and the GAAP EPS, it looks the Jefferson Street/Red Oak transition cost moved from $0.26 to $0.31 and then the refi cost looked like they moved down from 32% to 28%, so I don't know, Jeff, if you can help with that.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. On Red Oak, we did see some additional cost that we had not anticipated in the first quarter. All of it was related to relocation activities, primarily additional cost around cleanup and disposal of assets at Jefferson Street that we thought we had fully captured that cost in fourth quarter, and we had a couple of additional activities we had to take care of there. No additional growth in the depiction from a disruption standpoint. We think all of that is behind us but some additional one-time cost on getting out of Jefferson Street. On the refi, it really is the final calculation based on the timing of taking out of those 2018 notes where there was a dynamic on the call premium based on timing that came in a little lower than what we had been providing guidance to.

Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And if I could just ask one last one, I appreciate you giving us the top 10 programs by the different segments. But is there any way to look at how those have changed since all the prior quarters would have been in aggregate. So if I just look at it from 3 months ago to now, what were the major changes amongst the top 10?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. On the Aerostructures group, not a whole lot of change. The Bombardier Global 7000/8000 had moved into the top 10, I believe, last quarter. It is still there. We saw the 787 program move a little bit, but it really was just changing the positions. I wouldn't say anything of great significance on the Aerostructures side. On the Aerospace Systems side, the 787 program moving to the top of that list is driven by the GE acquisition with a significant content on 787. That also allowed the Airbus A320 to move up the list and also move the A380 up the list on the Aerospace Systems side. And I would say those were really the significant movements we saw in the quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steven Cahall.
Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Royal Bank of Canada. Maybe just one, first on the 747, I think the quantification of some of the potential forward loss is very, very helpful. Is just the right way to think about the range, the amount of visibility you have and then also the difference between 1 versus 1.25? Is that really the main swing factors or is there anything else we should be thinking about from a sensitivity standpoint?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. As we went through this analysis. Obviously, a lot of variables in play. One, being if there was a rate reduction, what is the timing of that rate reduction. And then what is the magnitude of that rate reduction and then for how long does it -- do we move forward at a lower rate. I would say the biggest dynamic impacting the range is really rate. So between 1 and 1.25 drove most of the dynamic between the $30 million and $60 million that we depicted. Keep in mind, on this contract, we're under contract through unit 1574. We know Boeing hasn't sold all those planes. Our analysis assumes that we run out through the end of the contract.
Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
That's great. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up maybe on the GE acquisition. I think, if I heard correctly, you said you expect that to be positive EBITDA by FY '16. So maybe kind of 2 questions. Is there much risk to that transition process or is this really the big contract that you talked about rolling off, and so there's not a lot of operational risk there? And then with the 787 moving up in Aerospace Systems, is this part of the issue there, is either coming to a learning curve or moving to a development contract on the 787 that rolls off next year.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Okay. So I'll try to remember both parts of the question, I'll answer the second one. The 787 program is fully developed. There -- in any program like this, you typically develop the system and get it qualified, get it delivered, and then there's typically a period of time where you go back and see if there's anything you can do to increase the value engineering possibilities in terms of cost reduction or in terms of weight reduction. And so there will be minor tweaks to this system in terms of improving it. But any kind of development activity on this program is well behind it. On the -- let me see, on the first part, talking really about operational risk and the integration of this company, the risks involved here are just those inherent with moving a -- anytime you move product from one place to another, we have to move out of Suzhou, China, for example, and we have to move our operations out of Cheltenham, out of the facilities that we share with GE. There are some risks inherent in moving any of those types of things. We have a lot of experience in doing that. So we don't really expect a great deal of downside to that. We plan for certain capital expenditures and other operational expenses in order to do that. But at the end of the day, we end up with, I think, a far more cost-effective footprint as we better utilize some of the facilities that we're moving this product to. So I think on balance, we're looking at a pretty positive experience here.

Operator
Our next question comes from Yair Reiner.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Oppenheimer. Just going back to Aerostructures for a bit. If I take out the impact from the cumulative catch-up adjustments, it looks like margin in the first quarter was a touch over 13%, which is actually a bit below where you've been trending over the last year. Maybe you can talk about what's driving that and why you expect it to improve as we move through the year.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. I think the main driver that we will see from an improvement in margin will be associated with realization of the Red Oak investment. And the dynamic we're in right now is most of the product that we're shipping out of Red Oak today are in accounting blocks that straddle fiscal year '14 and fiscal year '15. So many of those blocks are still burdened with the cost structure at Jefferson Street that's being averaged over the accounting block. As we get to the second half of the year and start completing the blocks that had Jefferson Street impacts, we'll get into pure accounting blocks that are just Red Oak and straddle FY '15 and FY '16. And we'll get the full benefit of the cost structure in Red Oak. That will be the primary driver of improvement as we look forward to the second half of the year. The only other nuance dynamic, I would say, in the first quarter that we saw is we did see a number of shipments on C-17 shift out of the first quarter into the second quarter. C-17 tends to be a program that we would generally see at or above average segment margins on. So what we have a little bit of a mix going on in the first quarter and that should correct itself in the second and third quarters.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
And then just as a follow-up. You mentioned in response to an earlier question that you expect that kind of by the middle of the year, towards the second half of the year, the Red Oak facility should start to have JSF-type margins. I was hoping you'd maybe give us a little more detail on that because where to draw the line on what the JSF margins really were is a bit difficult given some of the disruptions that have happened over the last year.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. Let me correct my statement, if I said margins. I meant to say performance, and performance really is recovery of the labor performance back to where we were, what I would depict as premove activity. So as we transitioned to Red Oak, getting tools set up, getting employees back on the tools and back up to fully up the learning curve, we're still working through that here in the first half of the year. But we definitely anticipate, and I'd say, that we're on -- we're there on many programs today. We'll be there on all programs by the middle of the year where our performance levels is at least at the level before the move activity started, which is -- has a relationship to margin. The bigger margin driver around Red Oak is really the cost structure in Red Oak versus Jefferson Street there.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Got it. You did say performance, I misread it to mean margin. My last question then I'll get back into queue. It looks like your guidance assumes that there's going to be some improvement in organic sales for the balance of the year. Can you give us kind of a rough sense of what you anticipate organic growth will be in the final 3 quarters?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. It definitely, I would say, as we look at the first quarter, it was light from a revenue standpoint. Part of that was just timing of deliveries around C-17 that we will see come back in the balance of the year. I would say, other than the C-17 dynamic, we wouldn't see much additional growth from the Aerostructures standpoint. In Aerospace Systems, we will see the inorganic benefit of the GE acquisition come in. So we will get 3 quarters of revenue generation there. We had anticipated full year revenue out of GE in the $180 million range. We would anticipate in the last 3 quarters between $140 million and $150 million of revenue generation out of that business. And we would expect to see, what I would depict as, low to mid single-digit organic growth within systems. Much of that is we would expect some pickup in the aftermarket element of Aerospace Systems in the balance of the year. That tends to be a bit seasonal for us. And we definitely saw a light quarter from an aftermarket element of Aerospace Systems. So that will drive a lot of the pickup there. And then in Aftermarket Services, there, I think, we are still anticipating a significant improvement from a top line standpoint and being able to hold bottom line margins. We still believe we will return to -- closer to FY '13 top line levels in Aftermarket Services. The cadence of opportunities we're seeing, primarily in commercial aftermarket, has increased significantly in that business, turning opportunities to revenue happens pretty quickly, and we don't have a long lead like we do in our other segments.

Operator
Our next question comes from David Strauss.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
UBS. I want to talk or ask about the C-17. So last quarter, you had a negative in cash, this quarter, there was nothing. But can you just talk about your ability to kind of manage that program down in risk? Jeff, you mentioned the margins there are above average, risks that kind of the margin profile as you manage that program down and how you're thinking about it, given that, I believe, Boeing still has about 10 unsold airplanes.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. I mean, on C-17, obviously, we're paying close attention because we definitely would expect a deterioration in labor performance as you get close to the end of production. And it's not necessarily folks aren't working as hard, it s that you tend to run into more issues with the parts flow and if you scrap apart, trying to get another
part from a supplier ends up creating disruption within the line. So we're definitely looking at kind of broad performance to degradate. That said, contractually, we believe we have a strong position to ensure that we're at least being kept whole for the dynamics of bringing a program to an end. So I wouldn't expect significant degradation in margin. I would expect some degradation in margin. But we think, ultimately, and we will work with the customer very closely to ensure that we're being compensated as this comes to on end. You also get that dynamic of, as it comes to an end, we still are optimistic of seeing a level of postproduction spares requirements that will allow us to at least help keep the line hot, so to speak, that will help us get through some of the tail-up issues we would see as the production units come to an end.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And Jeff, when would you expect revenues related to new aircraft builds ending?
Jeffrey L. McRae
On the big structure side, it will end at the -- pretty much in line with the end of the fiscal year. It starts bleeding in, in early, in the third quarter fiscal year, when we get into the detailed parts that we supply into C-17. So you'll start seeing a slow diminishment in revenue, Q3, Q4 and it's completely done from a production unit by the end of Q4.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. Then my last question on Gulfstream. The expectation is that Gulfstream is going to announce a refresh, update, whatever you want to call it, on the G455/450 program sometime in the near future. And obviously, you have a very large role on those programs. Can you just talk about kind of how you see your role on whatever the future G455/450 looks like?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. I mean, let me start, I mean, expectations -- and I think we have said this publicly. If not, we will now, is our expectation is we wouldn't see the same level of content on next-generation Gulfstream aircraft that we see today on the G550, where we deliberate fully integrated wing to Gulfstream. That said, with our structure, we can play at many levels of the supply chain feeding Gulfstream wings from a Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3. And I fully expect to have a high level of participation on any program Gulfstream launches. And although it might not be at the same level of supply that we have on the G550. I would fully expect it to look more like what we do on G450, where we supply a full wing box to Savannah. Not to say that we would be supplying a wing box, but I think revenue stream would look much like what we have on G450. And I think we will see a lot of opportunities to play at lower levels of the supply chain in the structures world. And I think there'll be a lot of opportunities for us to play on the systems side.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yes. I think all that goes to say that each customer, as they approach each new airplane and assuming that Gulfstream actually has an airplane as you described, is they tend to go through kind of cycles in terms of what they want to do internally, what they -- they go through their own make buys. And our structure enables us to participate at whatever level is appropriate for that customer at that time and our relationship with Gulfstream is a very positive one. So we are very confident that we will play a significant role in whatever new aircraft they come up with.

Our next question comes from Kim -- Ken Herbert.
Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
It's Canaccord. I just wanted to ask first, within the Aerostructures business, as you look at your footprint, I know you've got a number of other facilities, Hawthorne, Marshall Street other areas that are very 747 dependent. As you look out a couple of years, what's the opportunity within Aerostructures for, perhaps, additional cost savings, either leveraging Red Oak or maybe some adjustments as some of these other programs, like the 47 especially sunset?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Ken, we're not just thinking about a couple of facilities. We continually look at our entire portfolio of facilities and equipment, and we're continually looking to optimize that. I would say that kind of all options have always been on the table. And one of the things I was just thinking about, when Jeff was answering a question on C-17, was the fact that while our revenues, some of structures, individual structures, companies, kind of Tier 2 guys are going down relative to that program, they are also winning new products on other platforms in order to replace that but at the same time, we're looking at optimizing our footprint relative to that program's decline. So it's something that we go over on a regular basis. And so I'd say that your assumption is correct, that we're going to continue to evaluate facilities like Hawthorne and Marshall Street. But that just goes for every one of our other facilities as well.
Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then if I could, on the Aerospace Systems segment. Now with GE completed, can you just remind us how much of that business now is aftermarket and specifically, maybe the split there between commercial and military. I know you talked about strengthening on the commercial aftermarket within that segment.
Jeffry D. Frisby
I'm not sure, I'm remembering it, I think the Aftermarket business is relatively light. I know the repair business is virtually nonexistent. And I would say it's the overall aftermarket business is probably in the teens in terms of a percentage, which it needs to be quite a lot higher than that. And the military, the commercial breakdown, do you remember what that is?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes, it's weighted more heavily towards commercial with 87, 320 and 380 being the largest dynamics there. The content on the military side, largest program is V-22. I would say the overall weighting in the business is probably 75%-25% commercial and military.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Maybe 80%-20% something like that.
Jeffrey L. McRae
80%-20%.
Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Okay. So within the whole -- within the entire segment, though, so this -- the GE business pulls the aftermarket mix down a little bit for the entire segment then?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. The overall segment still runs about 80%-20%, OEM to aftermarket. So you might see initially a slight reduction to that. To Jeff's comments earlier, we're very optimistic we can drive a higher level of aftermarket into this GE business and so I would fully expect it in the midterm not to be a reducer of content from an aftermarket standpoint.
Jeffry D. Frisby
Yes, and remember that in our Aerospace Systems group, we have companies that are more built to print. This is -- those companies that are more proprietary we would normally expect to have a higher percentage of aftermarket. And this is clearly one of those. And so we believe that overall, we can -- those companies that are highly proprietary, we can in fact, drive more benefit from the aftermarket and we intend to do so.
Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Okay. And then just finally, so the pickup you're seeing within the segment on the aftermarket in the near term, within Aerospace Systems, it's obviously the GE acquisition helps because you've got runway there to build that side of the business. But with other parts of the segment, can you point to any specifics, whether it be geographically or other areas where you're seeing some of the pickup or maybe, I think, you referenced a step up in cadence of quote activity and other activities that give you confidence on the second half recovery?

Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. In Aerospace Systems, definitely expectation of a pickup on the aftermarket side in the balance of the year. We tend to see a level of seasonality in the aftermarket in this business. We also know we have a couple of what tend to be onetime sales each year that are falling in the second half of the year in that segment that, that will get us to where, I think, you would expect us to be in this segment. And we also have decent positions on programs that continue to -- you'll see pressures on ramping up such as 787.
Operator
Our next question comes from Julie Yates.
Julie Yates Stewart - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Crédit Suisse. Jeff, just on GPECS. I think last year you talked about seasonality in aftermarket. And last year you saw a big chunk of that in the fiscal first quarter. Are you seeing similar lumpiness this year? Or are you seeing a smoother profile through the year and then just broadly, how are margins progressing now that you owned the asset for 18 months?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Well, I'm not sure which -- well, I guess we can -- since we're both Jeff, we can both answer it. I think that inherently, in our Aerospace Systems group, we have some lumpiness. We generally see fourth quarter strength in some of our companies because there are some fairly predictable foreign military spares activities that happen at that time. In the earlier quarters, they usually -- the orders generally come in and the shipments usually come in, in big, big bunches. So we may not always see in the first quarter, some great strength, but we will see some lumpiness in that. And so we're confident we are going to see that. That we will have strong quarters in terms of that Aftermarket business in Aerospace Systems. Overall, the question on the margin growth.
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes, I think overall, Julie, as it relates to the Engine Control business, as we had talked in the latter half of FY '14. We were very pleased with the level of margin improvement we had seen in that business. And we continue to see strong margins, what I would depict as above-segment margins coming out of that business. Much of that ends up being related to aftermarket. So you do end up having some lumpiness. But our expectation for FY '15 is we would see a continuation of above-segment margins coming on that business.
Julie Yates Stewart - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then any more color on the military aftermarket? It's been a source of weakness for some time now. And I think the last few quarters you've talked about there being pent up demand. Are you starting to see -- do you have visibility on any of that demand starting to break free?
Jeffry D. Frisby
While we see the demand, Julie, it's not -- for example, the reason we see the demand will give you -- we have one of our companies that supports the C-17 repair business and our customer in this case has, in fact, delivered us all the -- all their stored units to -- that they were holding for repair. So we now we have them all. The trouble is, is that they have not authorized us to repair them because the funding has not been turned loose for that. So it's -- we see what the demand is, which is significant. It's just going to be a question of whether or not -- whether or not the need for the reentry of these products into the marketplace, which may be driven by flight hours on certain aircraft such as C-17, whether that drives a faster pace or whether we're just going to see kind of a normal ramp back up. But there is quite a lot of work out there to do. We just have to find what those triggers are to really get the funding moving.
Julie Yates Stewart - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then just last question. Is there any update on the pipeline of programs that you guys are bidding? And any color on win rate that you can offer?

Jeffry D. Frisby
Well, I don't think we have a lot of color on win rates. I would say that the pipeline is still robust and that we are still, I think, participating successfully. We have continued to win things of market share gains, things of this nature and continued -- continuing to maintain our position on most of our programs. We have a lot of discussions going on, and we would look forward to announcing those large wins when we get them. And in opportunities such as this, a lot of the wins we get are not -- usually don't enter the realm of really being worthy, volume-wise, of a press release. But when you multiply them 47x, they get to be pretty significant. So I guess when we get to quarterly opportunities, it's a good time to talk about some of those as we roll them up. So hopefully, we'll be able to do that. So I guess the answer, in a nutshell, is that the pipeline remains robust. We are still winning our -- at least our fair share, and we're confident that we'll continue to so.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Mecray.
Christopher Mecray
BlackRock. Could you just help us maybe just aggregate the cash flow forecast just a little bit given all the moving parts? If you take the Eaton settlement out and the other receivables that you got, have you, in fact adjusted your outlook for the year? And what, if anything, went into that?
Jeffrey L. McRae
As far as cash flow generation, we have not -- we have updated and reconfirmed what we had depicted previously of generation of roughly $250 million of free cash flow. Obviously, the first quarter was not a strong cash quarter for us. We definitely see the second quarter being much stronger with some of the elements we talked about that were held up in receivables at the end of the first quarter. And as we look at the balance of the year, similar to earnings, we would generally see the second half of the year from a cash generation standpoint being a much stronger half than the first half. But I would fully expect to see the second quarter being a strong cash generation quarter.
Christopher Mecray
Okay. So the weakness in the first quarter, which I do recognize is seasonally normal, isn't any worse than you would have necessarily expected?
Jeffrey L. McRae
No. No.
Christopher Mecray
Okay and one other thing. Sorry. Go ahead.
Jeffrey L. McRae
No, no, go ahead -- I hate to call it timing. But there's a lot of timing dynamics in that. And with the lower revenue in the first quarter, there's a little seasonality impact to it.
Christopher Mecray
Yes. Okay. The -- I don't know if it's material or not, but I assumed you had not anticipated the elimination of legal cost as of your Analyst Day. And I wonder what kind of tailwind that may provide for the balance of the year next year?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. If you remember what we talked about in the fourth quarter was the expectation that if the Eaton activity continued, we were reevaluating alternative fee structures with our legal counsel, which really in our mind, was going to make legal fees associated with Eaton 0 for the year. Because we would have moved to some form of contingent basis on settlement. Ultimately, we never had an agreement in place there. As you can see, with the netting that we did between 135.3 and 134 that we're showing, we did have that legal fee that we're netting out against the settlement. So ultimately, you should see 0 impact related to legal fees in Eaton in FY '15. That is also how our guidance was built.
Operator
Our next question comes from Stephen Levenson.
Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Stifel. Just to expand a little bit on the future opportunities. Do you see opportunities for increased content on A330 Neo? I know you're pretty happy about the life extension. But with the bigger engine, will the parts that you make require strengthening or is there something in addition?

Jeffry D. Frisby
We do see that there will be some change. We think that we'll be able to protect the work statement that we do have. But there are going to be some additional packages that will invariably come out. And we like our chances of increasing our scope of work on that aircraft.
Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And can you give us a little bit more detail on not necessarily what you expect to get, but timing on things like 737 MAX and 777X?
Jeffry D. Frisby
Well, 737 MAX, we're already winning content on that and have announced several things on the systems side. The structures pieces are -- they've announced on 777X for example, Boeing has announced some substantial awards to some of the Japanese suppliers, for example. We have strong relationship with those Japanese suppliers. And invariably, those types of decisions as to who is going to supply product in through that channel comes a little bit later. So I would say, what we're thinking about, that we've got maybe within the next year, 9 months to a year, something like that where we will expect to be able to announce what we're going to be supplying on the 777X. I would suspect that we are going to continue to supply whatever is applicable that we're currently doing on a 777. I would think we would carry that over. But what we're really looking for is additional opportunity on 777X. Now we have won systems products on 777X as well. So we are continuing to make inroads there.
Operator
Our next question comes from J. B. Groh.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
D.A. Davidson. I just had a quick follow-up on the backlog slide there. Is the total backlog between those 2 buckets sort of proportional to the revenue they generate?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
So structures is like 70-plus percent and Aerospace systems is 20-some percent of the total backlog. Is that fair way to look at it?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. If you think of backlog being really those 2 segments with little coming out of Aftermarket Services, it should be pretty proportional between the 2, J.B.
J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division
Okay. So structures backlog isn't necessarily disproportionately higher?
Jeffrey L. McRae
No. No.
Operator
Our next question comes from Yair Reiner.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Oppenheimer. Just a quick housekeeping question. What is the amortization expense within interest? And also what is the interest rate you're paying out on the revolver?
Jeffrey L. McRae
Yes. The total amortization flowing through interest? Is that the question?
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Exactly. And then also the interest rate on the revolver.
Jeffrey L. McRae
The revolver is running right around 2% today. The amortization flowing through interest -- I want to say it's in the $4 million to $5 million range. But I probably need to come back, specifically on that.

The books in this department are geared directly toward young readers who may not yet have the ability to read on their own or may still be learning the basics of how to sound out unfamiliar words, but we also have books for older kids ages 11 15 who are reading chapter books and other advanced children's literature. Our children's book offerings cover a wide range of reading abilities and subject matter, allowing you to build the perfect library for kids at every stage in their learning journey. Every Day Low Prices mean you can create an engaging and diverse collection of reading materials to enrich your kids' lives and make learning a fun experience for the whole family.Early childhood booksOur Children's Books department includes categories for books for children from ages Birth 2 Years and 3 4 Years. These are the shortest, simplest books, designed for parents to read out loud to their little ones. Some parents may use these easy-to-read books as a basis for teaching their children how to read by sounding out words and recognizing specific letters. If this kind of education is a priority for you, both of these sections include specially written books that focus on simple words, the alphabet and numbers from 1 10. If you'd rather just read to your child at this early stage, you can find plenty of simple stories and picture books in these sections that will suit that need as well.Books for school-aged childrenChildren who are more advanced can find longer and more complex books in our sections for children ages 5 7 and 8 11 years old. The 5 7 Years section includes a wide variety of short, simple books with easy plot lines and basic vocabulary that many elementary school children will be able to read on their own. Books in the 8 11 Years category become more advanced, dividing into chapter books that still have bigger print and smaller words to avoid frustrating young readers. Each of these sections includes classic titles and popular new books that you can choose from according to your child's personality and interests. We also have a special section for ages 15 & Up so high school-age kids can find the classics that are part of their school syllabi and discover new titles to read in their free time.Shopping for children's booksIf you're shopping for books just to add some new titles to your child's library, you can have them join you in the shopping process to make it more fun and make reading more exciting. Point out different book subjects and titles to your child and let him or her tell you which ones seem the most interesting. Focusing on the books in our Popular Brands & Characters section may be a particularly good idea when you're shopping for books with your kid; the familiar characters and themes will capture their attention and help them feel more excited about reading. If you're shopping for books as a gift for a baby shower, birthday or holiday, you can focus on classics that have shown up on kids' bedroom bookshelves for generations. From early-reader classics like the Richard Scarry Golden Books or the Berenstain Bears series to timeless chapter books like Hatchet and books by Judy Blume, picking out some of your own favorite children's books can be a fun way to bond with your children and carry on literary traditions in your family. Shopping for books for holidays is also made easy by focusing on our seasonal shops and sections in the Children's Books department. Mother's Day, Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Thanksgiving and other holidays are all popular subjects for children's books that will get your kids excited about the season.Boxed sets and collectionsOne great way to shop our Children's Books department is to look for boxed sets and book collections in our Character Books and Classic Books sections. You can find collected books from beloved authors or those featuring famous characters in these sections. Buying a complete collection at once gives your child the ability to work their way through all the books in the collection without needing to wait and buy each new book in a series. These collected sets also make fantastic gifts for baby showers, birthdays and other occasions. New parents will appreciate having their baby's bookshelves stocked with all the classics from a beloved series. We offer collections of Children's Books for different ages and stages of educational development, making this a versatile option throughout a child's life.Show moreElectrode, Comp-138129725, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167700710, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
