As of March 2013, it had the most assets of any listed company in Japan with a total of 33 trillion yen on its stand-alone balance sheet, more than twice the total assets of #2-ranked Tokyo Electric Power Company.[2]

Founded on September 15, 1902, Dai-Ichi was the oldest mutual insurance company in Japan until a motion to demutualise was passed in 2009 and, on April 1, 2010, it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising 1.01 trillion yen. As of March 2013, it had the most assets of any listed company in Japan with a total of 33 trillion yen on its stand-alone balance sheet, more than twice the total assets of #2-ranked Tokyo Electric Power Company.[2]

DN Tower 21, headquarters of The Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. The low-rise section (left front) was built in 1938 and served as SCAP headquarters (1945-1952).


The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (第一生命保険株式会社, Dai-ichi Seimei Hoken Kabushiki-kaisha), or Dai-ichi Life for short, is the third-largest life insurer in Japan by revenue, behind Japan Post Insurance and Nippon Life.
Founded on September 15, 1902, Dai-Ichi was the oldest mutual insurance company in Japan until a motion to demutualise was passed in 2009 and, on April 1, 2010, it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising 1.01 trillion yen. As of March 2013, it had the most assets of any listed company in Japan with a total of 33 trillion yen on its stand-alone balance sheet, more than twice the total assets of #2-ranked Tokyo Electric Power Company.[2]
It was announced in October 2014 that Dai-ichi would raise US$1 billion by issuing US-dollar-denominated subordinated bonds in overseas markets.[3]

Restoration of Mozart's former residence Completed in January 1996  | About Us | DAI-ICHI LIFE 






















The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company was founded in 1902, and since then has fulfilled its responsibilities to society through social action programs and through actively supporting the fields of arts and culture.One such program involved the reconstruction of the residence of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the world's most beloved composers. The residence itself was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War, but in 1996, it was restored to its former glory. One of the main reasons for rebuilding Mozart's home was to give people today and in the future a glimpse of how Mozart lived as a young man, in those rooms where he once composed some of the greatest music the world has ever seen.
The Story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and “the Mozart Residence”.

The Story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the Mozart Residence















Please enable JavaScript to watch this content.


Story 1
The Story of the Mozart Residence
The Mozart Residence - located in Salzburg's New Town, this was where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived as a young man, from the time he was 17 to when he was 24 years old. Also known as the Tanzmeisterhaus, or Dancing Master's House, it was destroyed during the bombing raids of the Second World War, but with the support of Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, the residence was rebuilt in 1996. This is the story of Mozart's Residence - where the spirit of Mozart himself can still be felt.

Story 2
Mozart's Violins
Mozart's three violins - the instrument he received from his father as a child, the instrument he used during his time as concert master to the court of the Archbishop of Salzburg, and the Italian-made Costa Violin he used when playing at home during his time in Vienna. We talk about these three instruments as we listen to the precious sounds they make.

Story 3
The Secrets of Mozart's Letters and Scores
The Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation holds a number of letters written by Mozart, including some to his father Leopold, and even musical scores written in his own hand. These items give us a powerful glimpse into his life and music, and they are currently stored in the most strictly controlled conditions in the special collection room in the basement of the Mozart Residence, giving us a picture of the man himself and his life that cannot be found elsewhere.

Story 4
Mozart's Keyboard Instruments
Here we take a look at two pianos currently in the possession of the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation that were once actually played by Mozart. You will have the chance to hear the true sound of these two instruments - one, the Walter piano Mozart used to have transported to his concerts from his home in Vienna, and two, the clavichord he used to compose music in the later years of his life.

Story 5
Mozart Audio-Visual Collection
The Mozart Residence shares facilities with the Mozart Audio-Video Collection, which was established in 1991. Visitors will learn about the oldest recording (1889) in the collection - of Danish baritone Peter Schram singing excerpts from Leporello's arias - the 1909 silent film Mozart's Last Requiem, and other items.















Lange: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the Piano (1789)


The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited was founded in 1902 and, ever since its establishment, has actively striven towards strong life insurance business operations. The focus was not solely financial, but to nurture a society that enjoyed peace of mind and a strong sense of community. Thus, as part of our corporate social responsibility drive, we proactively contribute towards society in various ways, including in the field of arts and culture.The majority of our efforts were expended on causes within Japan and we recognized the need to contribute to the global society. Hence, as one of our 90th anniversary projects, we contributed to the restoration of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's former residence. The restoration was successfully completed in 1996, and our involvement established a relationship with Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation, an organization world-renowned for its collection of original documents and academic research on one of the world's most beloved composers.This bond between our two organizations has flourished, and it is our pleasure to have realized several collaborative events with Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation in recent years.













There are two historical residences in Salzburg in connection to Mozart: the first was his birthplace, and the latter a second residence known as “Tanzmeisterhaus”. Unfortunately, bombing during World War II destroyed half of Tanzmeisterhaus, and a different structure was built on the damaged section of the property, thereby eradicating all traces of the house's original features.The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company supported the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation's restoration project, and in 1996 the residence was restored to its original form of the 18th century. Today, the residence is utilized as a museum and hosts various exhibitions and concerts, entertaining visitors from around the world.













Salzburg is a historic city surrounded by beautiful mountains located near the German border, and Salzburg's “Old Town” is registered as a World Heritage site. As a landmark, the Hohensalzburg Fortress rises above the rooftops and can be seen from any point in the city. The city maintained its independency as the archdiocese of Salzburg, and is now known for the birthplace of Mozart and the setting of the movie “The Sound of Music”.

To mark the 140th anniversary of the Japanese/Austrian treaty, Mozart's child violin (“Kindergeige”), owned by the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation, was brought to the East for the first time in history. It was played during a one-night only concert in Tokyo's National Museum of Art, and the concert was held alongside the “Habsburg Exhibition”, which portrayed fine arts from the time period.













Next, in commemoration of The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company's 110th year, an exhibition of the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation's collection of “Portraits of Mozart” was held at our company's headquarter building in Tokyo. Under supervision of internationally respected authority Mr. Bin Ebisawa, the collection was exhibited to depict Mozart from various perspectives. The exhibit displayed “Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the Piano” by Lange (1789) for the first time in Japan, a piece made famous in Japan by the well-known author Hideo Kobayashi's writings. The exhibition also hosted daily lobby-concerts by top musical performers from Japan which were well received by the audiences.
Bin Ebisawa, Mozart Lecture Concert - In harmony with violins and violas Mozart loved - November 2011
During the exhibition of Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation's collection “Portraits of Mozarto” a concert was hosted where violins and a viola which Mozart himself used during his lifetime was played. Lectures by Mr. Bin Ebisawa were also presented during the concert. It was the first time in the history for Japan to exhibit musical instruments possessed by Mozart. Performance by top orchestra members from the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation using Mozart's own instruments fascinated the audience.













On May 11, 2014, our headquarters' gallery was proud to host the Mozart Collection & Concerts - 250 Years of Sound. The very same violin made 250 years ago and loved by Mozart himself, along with a collection of items like scores written in his own hand, found their way to Japan for the exhibition.A Mozart program concert in the lobby from this precious violin and clavier captivated many people with resonance that transcended 250 years.











Print of Mozart with a lock of his hair


Based in Mozart's birthplace of Salzburg, Austria, the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation is an international organization that preserves and manages buildings related to Mozart, collects historical materials and publishes research findings on such materials. There are over a hundred original handwritten notes which include letters written by both Mozart and his father, as well as a collection of Mozart's personal belongings. The amassed collection numbers in the tens of thousands, making the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation one of the largest facilities to manage Mozart's materials. In recent years, the Foundation has also begun digitally processing musical scores and other materials.Furthermore, the Foundation hosts the International Mozart Week music festival in Salzburg, and exhibits its collections in both the house Mozart was born in and his second residence, the “Tanzmeisterhaus”. The Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation's historical roots stem from the “Cathedral Music Association and Mozarteum”, which was established 50 years after Mozart's passing. Mozart's widow Constanze Nissen was involved in the establishment, and many of Mozart's materials were provided by the Mozart family. In 1880, the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation was separated from the Cathedral Music Association and Mozarteum. Today, three institutions still bear the name Mozarteum: The Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation, the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg, and the Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra.

Mozart was born in Salzburg, Austria in 1756. By the time of his death in Vienna at the young age of 35, the genius had composed numerous pieces in various genres of music including opera, symphony, concerto, chamber music, songs and Church music. His father Leopold introduced Mozart to the world of music at the age of four. Mozart then composed his first musical piece at age 5, his first symphony at 8 and opera when he was 12. As a prodigy, he spent most of his time travelling, and was invited to most European major palaces such as the Schönbrunn Palace and the Palace of Versailles. Then, Mozart's dispute with the Archbishop of Salzburg when he was 25 meant that he spent the next 10 years as the world's first ever free musician, a time during which A. Salieri was the Hofkapellmeister in Vienna. Despite his success as a musician, Mozart was unable to secure either a stable income or fame and this dilemma was reflected in the pieces he composed in the latter years of his life, which gained more depth and gravity. Salzburg, with its annual music festival, is now considered a sacred place for music aficionados. It is a city that houses over 600 of Mozart's compositions, a priceless heritage to mankind of historical masterpieces that will be passed on to the coming generations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
