Riverbend Sand & Gravel Project - Fresno County, California
















 





Reliable and Sustainable
Construction Aggregates
to meet the current and long-term
demand for construction materials
in
Fresno County.
Project
Why sand & gravel and how is it used?
Each person in the Fresno market area uses approximately
6 tons per year of construction aggregates (sand and gravel) for:

Housing, Roads and Highways, Office Buildings, Schools, Shopping Centers, Public Infrastructure
and in a vast array of consumer, industrial, and agricultural products.
1.25MillionTons
The mined aggregate would be processed at an on-site processing plant to produce
1.25 million tons of finished product annually for the local region.
Product
How will the project benefit the local economy?The Riverbend Project will have a direct and indirect impact on the economy. 

At full operation, Riverbend Sand and Gravel will employ
29 full-time employees.

$58.9 million in annual output
to the economy of Fresno County.

335 jobs annually
earning $18.15 million in income.

$1.6 million
in annual tax revenue. Economy
How will our natural resources be conserved?
Riverbend is designed as an environmentally sound project that will balance the recovery of aggregate resources with the protection of other resources including wildlife habitat, groundwater, surface water and air quality. 
Over 200 acres of the ranch are excluded from the Project to protect the wildlife habitat
and floodway along the Kings River.


Farming will continue on the phases not actively being mined. Approximately 350 acres of important farmland will continue to be farmed for at least 30 years after the Project is initiated.


Reclamation of the Project site would create approximately 268 acres of reclaimed farmland and approximately 351 acres of open space, namely riparian and open water wildlife habitat.


43% of the mined land will be reclaimed to farmland of equal or better quality of that currently existing on the site by improving the current rocky, stressed soil conditions.


57% of the mined land will be reclaimed to Open Water and Riparian Habitat which will effectively expand the existing wildlife corridor by 1/3 to 3/4 of a mile wide by almost 2.5 miles long.

									How to Choose Your Kitchen Faucet




Green Living: The Eco-Friendly Way to Replace a Kitchen Faucet
When it comes to your kitchen and bath, paying attention to the environment often means saving money too—and many improvements pay back quicker than you might think. Here are some tips.
Don't delay fixing a leaky faucet
The Sierra Club, the nation's largest environmental organization, tells us that ignoring a leak can waste up to three gallons of water a day or 1,095 gallons a year. Replace your old kitchen faucet with a model that utilizes a ceramic disc cartridge. You'll enjoy leak-free performance and save water too.
Don't put your replacement off because you think you can't afford a new faucet. After extensive testing, Consumer Reports found that many lower cost faucets from reputable manufacturers offered durability and performance that equaled premium products.
Go low flow
Government regulations mandate a faucet flow rate of 2.5 gpm (gallons per minute) or less. However, new faucets with low-flow aerators feature a 1.5 gpm or lower rate without sacrificing functionality. If you don't want to replace your faucet, it's usually quite easy to replace just the aerator.
The benefits of quality
Go ahead, invest in that better-quality faucet. You'll get the look you really want while saving on future replacement and repair expense. Plus, you're doing the planet a favor by putting less trash in landfills.
It may not seem like much, but environmentalists often say that living greener is all about changing our attitudes and taking small steps that add up.
A greener way to stay hydrated
Replace your soap dispenser or other faucet accessory with a filtered drinking water dispenser. If you don't have an extra installation hole available, get an under sink filter.
Either way, the money you'll save on bottled water will offer you a dramatic payback.
Learn more about how to choose your kitchen faucet or how to find the right pot filler faucet.

									Designing a Utility Room to Meet Your Needs




Planning a Multi-Purpose Room You'll Enjoy
Your home's utilitarian spaces such as laundry rooms, work room, and mudrooms seldom get the attention they deserve. These hardworking rooms can be as beautiful as they are functional with a little planning and effort, you can turn your laundry room into an enjoyable, multi-purpose space.

Design Ideas for a Utility Room
Just because it's a utility room, doesn't mean your laundry room has to be mundane. With a little bit of foresight and just the right products, you can create a room that works for you by simplifying your household chores while also being stylish, beautiful, and efficient.

The addition of an all-purpose laundry sink goes a long way into making a utility room into a multi-tasking area of your home. Whether you choose a standalone floor-mounted or wall-mounted unit, or a drop-in sink surrounded by a countertop that gives you a place to fold clothes, a laundry sink makes it easy to clean up after messy chores such as gardening or painting without having to use your kitchen sink for the task.

Storage shelves, cabinets, and bins help keep your utility room tidy and organized while giving you a place to store household cleaning essentials within easy reach.

Riverbend Home carries quality products to make your laundry room come to life from popular Mustee brand sinks to storage items, accessories, and themed décor.
Remodeling your laundry room and need some advice? Check out the helpful tips in our article Designing A Utility Room To Meet Your Needs.

Add Structure to a Room with Furniture and Rugs
Bring form and function to your living areas. Accent chairs such as classic wingback, club, armchairs, stools, benches, and occasional chairs provide extra seating with style and comfort. Add an ottoman for an additional place to sit or rest your feet. Choose from a fabric and leather upholstery in a variety of colors and patterns to find the design that best suits your style.
Coffee tables, side tables, consoles, and accent tables not only add to the look of any room, they offer a place to display your personal items. Chests, shelves, and cabinets make great focal points and give you a place to store books, collectibles, and other effects. Since pets are family too, our collection of pet beds gives your furry friends a place of their own to rest and relax.

An area rug can complement your hardwood or tile floors, add warmth and softness, or delineate sitting or dining areas in more open spaces. They add texture, color, and visual interest to your rooms while enhancing your décor and reflecting your individual style taste. 
Select a rug according to the style, material, shape, and size that best suits your need. Determine the size rug you need based on the size of the space, how the room is used, the arrangement of your furniture, and where the rug will be placed. Consider the specific areas you want to define and the traffic patterns that flow through the room. Measure that area for how much room various rugs would take up and take into account how much exposed floor would remain.
Our selection of area rugs are hand-crafted in flat weave, knotted, loomed, and tufted designs in a selection of wools, cottons, viscose blends, natural fibers such as jute, hemp, and even leather. With styles ranging from traditional to contemporary and everything in between and a wide variety of colors, patterns, and sizes, you'll find it easy to find just the right rug to dress up any room in your home.

How to Choose Your Bathroom Sink Faucet





Things to Consider When Selecting Your Bathroom Faucets
Coordinate your various fixtures 
Most manufacturers carry collections of bathroom faucets so that you can match your bathroom sink faucets to your bathtub and shower faucet sets and everything in between—even the small things like diverters and bidet faucets have coordinating finishes and styles with other bath fixtures. 
Some bath fixtures inevitably will outlast others either in terms of their lifespan or style. Homeowners often replace showerheads, handshowers, and shower arms more often than other bathroom faucets, so be sure to choose a finish for your bathtub faucets and fillers, shower faucets, and shower systems that will be easy to match with the rest of the fixtures in your bath. Decorating your bath with standard finishes and styles not only makes it easier to update your bath, but is better for your home resale value too.
Safety first 
If you have or plan to have children or elderly living in your home or you plan on aging in your home, consider installing valves that allow for more control over the water temperature as we tend to lose sensitivity to heat as we age. Many valves come with an anti-scalding feature. Check your local building codes, it may even be required in your area. Look for pressure balancing valves or thermostatic valves that have this extra safety precaution. 
Pressure balancing valves use just one handle to control both volume and temperature with a dial or set-screw to set the stop-point for the handle rotation to adjust the maximum ratio of hot to cold water. These valves react to changes in water pressure and compensate to maintain a consistent temperature. Delta's Monitor series, Moen's Moentrol and Posi-Temp series, and Grohe's GrohSafe are examples of pressure balance valves.
Thermostatic valves use two handles, one to control volume and one to control temperature. Thermostatic valves react to water temperature rather than pressure to regulate the temperature.  A wax element inside the valve expands or contracts in reaction to heat. When the water supply exceeds the maximum set temperature, the element expands to reduce the flow of hot water, allowing more cold into the mix. Thermostatic valves give more direct control over the output temperature without adjusting the setting on your water heater. Examples of thermostatic valves are Ecostat by Hansgrohe, ioDigital and ExactTemp by Moen, Grohtherm by Grohe, and TempAssure by Delta.
Bidets have faucets too 
Although bidet popularity is on the rise, bidet faucets are a bit more limited when it comes to availability of styles and finishes. So, you may want to start with your bidet faucets when taking on your bath design and coordinate the rest of your bathroom faucets and fixtures from there.
Learn more about how to choose your bathroom sink faucet or bathtub faucets, showerheads and shower systems.
