As Chief of the United States mission in China, he served two Presidents and was responsible for directing, coordinating and managing the activities of all United States Executive Branch activities in China. Prior to assuming duties in China, Admiral Prueher served as a lecturer and Senior Advisor to the Stanford-Harvard Preventive Defense Program and as a Senior Fellow at the Center for Naval Analysis.
Admiral Prueher completed thirty-five years of distinguished service in the United States Navy in May 1999.

The largest military command in the world, CINCPAC spanned over half the earth's surface and included over 300,000 people. In this capacity, Admiral Prueher worked with Asia-Pacific civil and military leaders to promote collective security and cooperation in the area. From 1989 through 1995, Admiral Prueher served as Commandant of Midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis; Commander of Carrier Battle Group ONE based in San Diego; Commander of the U.S. Mediterranean Sixth Fleet and of NATO Striking Forces based in Gaeta, Italy; and as Vice Chief of Naval Operations in the Pentagon.
Foremost a carrier based attack pilot for his first 24 years of service, he also spent three years as a Navy Test Pilot at Patuxent River, MD. He has extensive flight and combat experience, with over 5600 flight hours and over 1000 carrier landings. He was qualified in 52 types of aircraft, held numerous senior tactical commands, including two carrier air wings, and led the formation of the Naval Strike Warfare Center in Fallon, NV.
Admiral Prueher hails from Nashville, TN, where he graduated from Montgomery Bell Academy. In 1964, he graduated with distinction from the U.S. Naval Academy and later received a M.S. in International Relations from George Washington University. He is also a graduate of the Naval War College in Newport, RI. In addition to co-authoring the Performance Testing Manual used by naval test pilots for many years, he has published numerous articles on leadership, military readiness, and Pacific region security issues.
Admiral Prueher has received multiple military awards for combat flying as well as Naval and Joint Service. Additionally he has been decorated by the governments of Singapore, Thailand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia. Currently, in addition to speaking and consulting on international issues, he sits on the Board of Merrill Lynch, Emerson, New York Life, and several other corporate, educational, and civic boards.
His wife, Suzanne, and he currently reside in Virginia Beach, VA. Their daughter, Brooks Barwell, an urban planner, lives with her husband in Alexandria, VA. Their son, Joshua, a Naval Officer, and his wife live in Washington, DC.

Department History







Department History
Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series
                        of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with new
                        diplomatic challenges.
This portion of our website contains a short history of the
                            department, biographies of the Secretaries of State, a database of Principal
                            Officers and Chiefs of Mission, and a history of the buildings of the Department
                            of State.
The Department of State has grown significantly over the years. The first
                        Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief
                        clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained
                        two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. 
World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945) brought vastly increased
                        global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent
                        power. New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the
                        Soviet Union, included: 
the newly independent states,
the global economy,
terrorism, and
the security of the American overseas presence. 

To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and
                        overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to: 
1,228 in 1900,
1,968 in 1940,
13,294 in 1960,
and 15,751 in the year 2000.

The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and
                        continues to grow.

Joe Prueher | Promotion restores shine to tarnished Navy career - tribunedigital-baltimoresun






 


Home→Collections→NavyPromotion restores shine to tarnished Navy careerApril 09, 1995|By Thomas W. Waldron | Thomas W. Waldron,Washington Bureau of The SunWASHINGTON -- Three years ago, the high-flying military career of Joseph W. Prueher seemed finished -- grounded by an incident during his tenure as a top official at the U.S. Naval Academy in which a female midshipman was handcuffed to a urinal.Several Navy officers in the past few years have seen their careers tarnished or short-circuited by criticism over their handling of sexual harassment cases. But thanks to patient support from the top ranks of the Pentagon, Admiral Prueher managed to survive, even flourish.His turnaround culminated Thursday, when the Senate confirmed him as vice chief of naval operations -- the Navy's second-highest uniformed position.To his supporters in the Navy, the ascension of Joe Prueher (pronounced PREE-er) is vindication for an honorable and conscientious officer whose name had been unfairly tainted by the handcuffing case.Even U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, a member of the academy's governing Board of Visitors, gave her blessing to Admiral Prueher in a recent meeting, concluding that the incident had taught him a good lesson about women in the military.But the parents of the female midshipman at the center of the incident say they are still angry that Admiral Prueher was never held accountable for the relatively lax punishments in the case. His rise, they say, is evidence that the Navy's old boy system is alive and well."To me, Joe Prueher is the epitome of the failure of Navy leadership," said Carolyn Dreyer, the mother of Gwen M. Dreyer, the female midshipman. "It was handled horribly. But he somehow magically escaped."Ms. Dreyer, then a second-year midshipman, was handcuffed to a urinal in a men's restroom after a campus snowball fight in December 1989. Eight male midshipmen were punished, none severely.Not long after the incident, Ms. Dreyer left the Naval Academy and graduated from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo in 1993. She works as an engineer for Apple Computer and plans to get married in August. She declined to be interviewed.While some Navy people said the incident was nothing more than academy horseplay, others said it symbolized a macho campus atmosphere that sometimes left women feeling denigrated and unwelcome at the predominantly male academy.On Capitol Hill, criticism of the Navy's handling of the case mounted. The the career of the Naval Academy superintendent, Adm. Virgil L. Hill Jr., was derailed: He received a lateral transfer after his Annapolis duty instead of the standard promotion and has left the Navy.As commandant of midshipmen, the No. 2 officer at the academy and the one responsible for disciplining student misconduct, then-Captain Prueher was deeply involved in the Dreyer case. And, according to Ms. Dreyer's parents, he mishandled it.Her father, Gregory F. Dreyer, himself a Naval Academy graduate, said in 1992 that when he complained about the academy's handling of the case, Captain Prueher told him to "back off" or he would release photographs taken by midshipmen that showed Ms. Dreyer smiling during the handcuffing.Congressional staffers remembered Admiral Prueher's role and sent up red flags in 1992 when President George Bush nominated him to assume command of the Navy's 3rd Fleet, based in San Diego.With the Tailhook scandal unfolding -- marked by charges that drunken Navy fliers had fondled and humiliated women -- sensitivity to allegations of sexual harassment was running high.Rather than engage in a public fight in the Senate and risk losing Admiral Prueher's 1992 nomination altogether, Navy leaders withdrew his name from consideration.Another chanceSeveral months later, the mood on Capitol Hill had softened enough to convince Admiral Frank B. Kelso II -- then chief of naval operations -- and others that Admiral Prueher wouldreceive a fair hearing. He was nominated for another promotion.The Dreyers again told congressional staffers about their unhappiness with Admiral Prueher's handling of their daughter's case. Despite their criticism, his nomination cleared the Senate."It was clear that he wasn't in charge at the academy at the time," said a Senate staffer familiar with Admiral Prueher's 1993 confirmation. "Other than that one case, he had a good record."A few months later, the Senate approved a second promotion, to the three-star rank of vice admiral. In his new position, he holds the four-star rank of admiral.To help smooth the current promotion, Admiral Prueher paid three courtesy calls: two to the senators from his home state of Tennessee and one to Senator Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat and a leading voice on women's issues in Congress.The senator had "deep concerns" about the disciplinary actions in the Dreyer case, a Mikulski aide said. Admiral Prueher said he told the senator he would have handled the Dreyer case differently today. Ms. Dreyer deserved more sympathy, the admiral said, and those responsible for the incident possibly deserved harsher punishment.1 | 2 |  Next

Admiral Prueher is also a Consulting Professor and Senior Advisor at Stanford University.
Admiral Prueher served as Ambassador to the People's Republic of China from November 1999 to May 2001. As Chief of the United States mission in China, he served two Presidents and was responsible for directing, coordinating and managing the activities of all United States Executive Branch activities in China. Prior to assuming duties in China, Admiral Prueher served as a lecturer and Senior Advisor to the Stanford-Harvard Preventive Defense Program and as a Senior Fellow at the Center for Naval Analysis. Admiral Prueher completed thirty-five years of distinguished service in the United States Navy in May 1999. From February 1996 until then, he was the 17th Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC), the senior military commander of all the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force troops in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and their littoral areas. The largest military command in the world, CINCPAC spanned over half the earth's surface and included over 300,000 people. In this capacity, Admiral Prueher worked with Asia-Pacific civil and military leaders to promote collective security and cooperation in the area. From 1989 through 1995, Admiral Prueher served as Commandant of Midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis; Commander of Carrier Battle Group ONE based in San Diego; Commander of the U.S. Mediterranean Sixth Fleet and of NATO Striking Forces based in Gaeta, Italy; and as Vice Chief of Naval Operations in the Pentagon. Admiral Prueher hails from Nashville, TN, where he graduated from Montgomery Bell Academy. In 1964, he graduated with distinction from the U.S. Naval Academy and later received a M.S. in International Relations from George Washington University. He is also a graduate of the Naval War College in Newport, RI. In addition to co-authoring the Performance Testing Manual used by naval test pilots for many years, he has published numerous articles on leadership, military readiness, and Pacific region security issues. Admiral Prueher has received multiple military awards for combat flying as well as Naval and Joint Service. Additionally he has been decorated by the governments of Singapore, Thailand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
