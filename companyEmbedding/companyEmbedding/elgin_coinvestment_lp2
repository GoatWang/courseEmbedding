Elgin National Watch Company
In the spring of 1864 half a dozen ambitious Chicago businessmen decided that if Massachusetts could build a factory that built watches – Illinois could, too. Harper’s magazine summed their sentiment perfectly: “It was the genuine, audacious, self-reliant Western spirit.” By August of that year this consortium, including then-Chicago mayor Benjamin W. Raymond, purchased an abandoned farm 30 miles north of Chicago and built a watch factory there. After a year of designing and building the lathes and machines to achieve seemingly impossible levels of precision, a team of watchmakers and mechanical engineers produced their first pocket watch movement, named for mayor “B.W. Raymond.” The watch was exquisite: Elgin National Watch Company was born.
By 1910, word of Elgin’s obsession with precision had spread around the world. Elgin engineers built their own Observatory to maintain scientifically precise times in their watches. Later, their accurate “wristlet” watches proved to be vital to the WWI war effort, helping to fuel a craze back in the states for something called “The Wrist Watch.” By the opulent Jazz Age, if you weren’t displaying the exuberant symmetry of an Elgin wrist watch or carrying a svelte, distinctive Elgin pocket watch, then who were you? Elgin had helped define the American pocket watch as unsurpassed in “Railroad Accuracy.” By 1930, the post Civil War dream factory imagined by a handful of American entrepreneurs had produced 32 million “time machines.”
During World War II, all civilian manufacturing was halted and the company moved into the defense industry, manufacturing military watches, chronometers, fuses for artillery shells, altimeters and other aircraft instruments and sapphire bearings used for aiming cannons.
While their altruism was vital to the war effort, Elgin’s patriotism ironically opened an opportunity for the Swiss. By 1964, after a Mid-Century decade that saw the rise of the elite “Lord and Lady Elgin” series, the original Elgin factory closed. Over the course of a century, the dream factory just north of Chicago had produced half of all jeweled pocket and wristwatches manufactured in the United States.
The legendary Elgin watch has become woven into the fabric of America:

Robert Johnson, pre-eminent Delta bluesman, sang “She’s got Elgin movements from her head down to her toes” in his 1936 recording of “Walkin’ Blues”.
NBA Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor was named after the Elgin National Watch Company.
Daniel Beard’s sketches of an angel at the end of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court are based on the Elgin National Watch Company’s logo.
The Steeleye Span album Bloody Men contains a track titled “Lord Elgin”: ostensibly a love song, it is, in fact, about the Lord Elgin Watch.
Elgin Watch Company is referenced in the video game L.A. Noire, which takes place in post-World War II Los Angeles.

Morguard Page Content3​The Opportunity
Execute on a vision to build a LEED Gold Class A office tower in downtown Ottawa that meets the market demand for competitive and sustainable workplaces, provides stable income and high yields for Morguard's shareholders and its co-investor client and sets the benchmark for public benefit spaces. ​


The Value Proposition

   Morguard's approved design called for a 360,000 square foot Class A office tower with commitments to public benefit sp​aces and preservation of a designated heritage building on the site. Morguard's asset management, development, and leasing teams worked collaboratively to: secure a solid deal structurecreate long-term value for shareholders and investorsdevelop and implement a lease strategy

         As a LEED Gold certified building, Performance Court has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any multi-tenanted office tower in Canada. The target is a 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to the Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB).First-of-its-kind in Canada, interactive public benefit space including a street level art gallery, a winter garden with a three-storey digital screen and an outdoor terrace with sweeping views of the nation's capital.​​​​​Earned BOMA BEST Platinum Certification in 2016.

Grandmaster: An Alternative to the Alternatives
Advisors today are facing some tough choices on behalf of their clients. They demand alternatives to the traditional equity/fixed interest portfolio mix yet so many alternative funds have over-promised and under-delivered. Many have suffered large losses, and others are often illiquid or, in the extreme, even fraudulent.
In an age where every investment house tries to position a new fund with “unique and special” qualities, in order to market it,  financial advisors have become very cynical and sceptical about a fund’s true value.  After all, many funds have been dubious and ended up doing everything but what was promised. 
Being unable to find a reliable, liquid and cost-effective solution from the universe of alternative funds, we created one. Years of research and proven excellence in due diligence result in one strategically conceived investment fund giving access to a small selection of elite institutional managers otherwise out of reach of retail investors.
Where Grandmaster is indeed unique is that it was initially created only for use in the alternative portion of our own investors’ portfolios, in order to give them access to top funds with very large minimum entry levels of 1M+. As a result, our analysts truly sought what we believe are the best hedge funds – most of which are used as the private pot of the managers (significant co-investment by the principals) and where the outside investors are pension funds, and not advisors or private banks. 



The documents and their contents are only intended to provide general information about the Grandmaster Fund to institutional/professional investors and/or any other authorised financial intermediary as specified in the Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament (AIFMD) and within the meaning of Annex II to Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID).
