But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More After A Car AccidentMost people don't want to think about getting into an accident, but it's a reality many of us will have to deal with at some point. I know that a car accident can be frightening, but you can help reduce some of the stress by knowing what to do ahead of time. Remember to always keep current proof of insurance in the car, and follow these tips about your personal safety, documenting the accident and beginning the claims process.Learn More Rent Or Own CalculatorIf you're wondering whether you should rent or own, there's a lot to consider. Aside from whether the space is right for you, how much maintenance you want to be responsible for and how to decorate, this decision can have financial implications. You'll need to consider monthly as well as long-term expenses in your decision. Use this calculator to help you compare the costs and whether renting or buying makes the most sense for you.Learn More What Is Whole Life Insurance?You know life insurance is a great way to help protect your loved ones, but do you know what kind of life insurance might be best for you? If you're looking for life-long protection, predictable costs and a savings vehicle, whole life insurance might be a good fit. Take a look at this overview to see if it's something that interests you. I'd be happy to tell you more about whole life insurance and help you decide if it's the right choice for you.Learn More Is Your Office Rental Covered?Renting an office for your business makes sense - you have the space you need without the costs or maintenance of owning the building. But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office. Whether it's making sure your computers would be replaced or recouping potential losses after a disaster, let's talk about insuring your business before you sign that lease.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Fire Damage To Your CondoLiving in a condominium has its perks, especially if the condo board manages upkeep of the building. But you're still at risk when things go wrong in common areas or neighboring units, especially when it comes to a fire. The damage can be hard enough to deal with, but you could also be left wondering whose insurance will cover the costs of repairs and replacing your belongings. While you hopefully never experience a fire in or near your condo, it is important to be familiar with not only your condo insurance's fire coverage but also with the association's coverage.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Davis.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(530) 756-9211(530) 756-9211Fax(530) 756-9218(530) 756-9218Email:gregp@allstate.comgregp@allstate.comAddress:437 F StDavis, CA 95616Get DirectionsLandmarks:We are on the corner of 5th and F St. Enter the parking lot by going east bound on 5th St.Areas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Davis, Woodland, Winters.
