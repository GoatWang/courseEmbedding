Distinguished Alumni 2011: Jeffrey S. Hatfield 
 

Jeffrey S. Hatfield
CEO, Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Jeff Hatfield was born and raised in Indianapolis.  He received his BS degree from Purdue  University’s School of Pharmacy in 1981.   While at Purdue, his passion for blending science and business emerged  as a lifelong career goal.  Working with  Dr. Ken Kirk, head of Purdue’s PhAd department at the time, Jeff pursued a  uniquely designed curriculum that supplemented the core pharmacy program and  work as a teaching assistant in clinical pharmacy with extensive elective coursework  at the Krannert School of Management.  While  in the program, Mr. Hatfield wrote a three-stage plan that became the blueprint  for the next 10 years of his career.
After graduating from Purdue, Mr. Hatfield began work as a  pharmacist for Revco Drug Stores in southern Indiana.  The following year, he was promoted to Chief  Pharmacist / Store Manager in Martinsville, becoming Revco’s youngest store  manager.  Working double shifts for the  better part of the next two and a half years, he earned enough money to continue  on to the next stage of his plan, pursuing an advanced degree in business.  In 1983, Mr. Hatfield was accepted into the  Master’s program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of  Business, where he completed his MBA in 1985.
After graduation, Mr. Hatfield entered the third stage of  his plan, beginning work at Squibb (now Bristol-Myers Squibb), as an analyst  and business consultant to the central US business unit.  From there, he progressed through a variety of  field and corporate positions, ultimately gaining responsibility for the  eastern quarter of the US.  In 1995, Mr.  Hatfield was put in charge of BMS’s US Managed Health Care business,  responsible for negotiating and contracting over $7 billion of product sales  through the full array of managed care entities, including HMOs, insurers, PBMs  and state and federal government agencies.
In 1997, Mr. Hatfield became President of BMS Canada, where  he was responsible for all aspects of the company’s three core business  units:  branded products, generics and hospital  products.  During his tenure in Canada,  the company enjoyed strong performance, including success with several product  launches that achieved sales and market share significantly above global  standards.  Mr. Hatfield also took a leadership  role with the pharma industry’s trade organization, the Pharmaceutical  Manufacturer’s Association of Canada (PMAC), where he first served as Board  member, then Treasurer and eventually Vice Chairman.  In his role with PMAC, Mr. Hatfield worked directly  with the Canadian government on regulatory, access, reimbursement and other  policy issues.  In 2000, BMS-Canada was  recognized as the ‘Most Admired Company’ in the province of Quebec.
In 2001, Mr. Hatfield returned to the US as head of BMS’s  Virology and Immunology Divisions.  While  in that role, he redefined the divisions’ clinical, operational and financial  strategies, acquired and merged DuPont’s virology business, and launched  blockbuster Reyataz® to the market.  Most  significantly, Mr. Hatfield conceptualized and negotiated an initiative with the  primary competitor company, Gilead Pharmaceuticals, to better serve the needs  of people living with HIV by creating the industry’s first “one-pill, once-a-day”  complete HIV drug regimen.  The product,  Atripla®, now generates over $3 billion in annual sales.
In 2004, Mr. Hatfield left the security of large pharma to enter  the entrepreneurial world of biotech as President and CEO of Vitae  Pharmaceuticals, a privately held, venture-backed biotech research company focused  on novel approaches to rational, structure-based drug discovery.  Since joining Vitae, Mr. Hatfield has grown his  company from an intriguing platform technology start-up into a highly  productive, clinical-stage drug discovery and development engine.  Vitae currently is advancing a robust  pipeline of internally discovered assets in large therapeutic areas with high  unmet medical need, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease  and atherosclerosis.  Vitae’s lead  program, VTP-27999, is advancing towards Phase IIb clinical trials on an  accelerated biomarker-based registration path negotiated with FDA.
Vitae was recently recognized as one of Pennsylvania’s ‘Top  50 Best Places to Work’ - #11 among all PA industries / companies.  Vitae also was recognized by the trade  publication The Scientist as a life  sciences ‘Best Place to Work’ with a #6 ranking among all life science  companies.  Further, Mr. Hatfield has  been recognized in Ernst & Young’s annual Entrepreneur of the Year contest,  and last year was a Philadelphia area Life Science CEO of the Year.
Mr. Hatfield currently serves on the Board of Directors of Vitae  Pharmaceuticals and the Board of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO),  the biotech industry’s national policy organization.  He is also an advisor and visiting lecturer for  Purdue University’s School of Pharmacy and advisor to Drexel University’s LeBow  College of Business.
Mr. Hatfield is married to Janet who works for a global  wound care and ostomy company in Princeton, NJ.   He has two sons, ages 26 and 24.   Steven is a social worker and Brian is completing his Master’s in  Medicine at Boston University.  In his  down time, Jeff enjoys competitive cycling, racquetball and golf.

 Educational Background



Bachelor's Degree in Pharmacy 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.
