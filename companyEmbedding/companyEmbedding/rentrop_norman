    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Norman Rentrop is the chairman of Rentrop Investment Office (Rentropsche Vermögensverwaltung). He is an investor in both private and public equity. In private equity Norman has invested in 18 companies in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Russia, China and USA with an IRR of 16.5 % p.a. (1991 – 2002). Among his better known investments have been Sunday Business Post, N-TV (the German news channel) and ADI Auftragsdienst der Deutschen Industrie (Construction Market). He presents a very entrepreneurial outlook towards investing by not being afraid of going against the crowd and sometimes, even investing against some high sentiment. Norman is a very hands-off investor like his great role model Warren Buffett. You can see him regularly at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder meeting (1st Saturday in May in Omaha, NE). Norman built a 100 million Euro professional publishing company from scratch. After his 40th birthday he moved from the operational side of the publishing company to chairman of the supervisory board to have more time for inner reflection and his family. Currently, the publishing company is run by excellent managers while Norman oversees the investing of his family office. His family office invests in:a) undervalued public companies b) merger arbitrage and special situations c) enhanced indexing d) Berkshire Hathaway e) Private equity with a very long term (10+ years) outlook Rentrop Family Office focuses on investing, growing family wealth and tax administrations and their goal is to grow family wealth 12% p.a. NOT preserve wealth. The Rentrop Family Office treats investors as partners who are expected to contribute by alerting partnership about private companies that fit our criteria. Coming from a business owner perspective that understands the value of keeping cost low they manage to keep the management costs at  0.25% management fee and 0% performance fee. After WWII, his grandfather taught him to invest in stocks at a time when investing was not a common practice in Germany. After the family’s real estate in Cologne was destroyed in WWII his grandfather drew the conclusion not to invest in inner-city real estate again, but to invest in publicly traded companies. . What more he learned was that stock is a piece of a real company which could be watched or observed every day. Moreover, if you want to go into the accounting profession you have to be satisfied regardless of that fact that there will be people who will make a lot more money than you.Evolution of investment strategies of Norman Rentrop:In 1931 there were 3,000 public companies in Germany versus about 1,000 today). In 1967, he bought his first share at the age of 10 and attended his first shareholder meeting at the age of 15. In his evolution as an investor Norman Rentrop tested different asset classes. In the 1980s he bought silver as an investment, with poor results.His publishing company was one of the most audacious in delivering their publications to communist east germany and after the separting wall came down in late 1989, there was a lot of pent up demand. Rentrop publishing delivered all orders to East Germany as fast as they could even though there was great uncertainty about the value of the East German Mark. Grey market rates in Zurich looked like 1:20 at the time. When Chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl decided to exchange the weak East German Mark 1:3 to the strong West German Mark, Rentrop publishing company felt highly rewarded.  for East German investments in 1990.In 1992, Rentrop bought his first share of Berkshire Hathaway, after reading John Train’s ‘The Money Masters’.In 1993, while on vacation in Florida, he was reading ads in the newspaper for real estate when he saw an ad for a building that had asbestos. As he could not figure out immediately whether the price was for rent or to buy.(the price for sale was as low as  1x a year of rent.), he began to research real estate investments in the U.S. and made several investments. While they all performed, he got more joy out of his investments in businesses and therefore concentrates on what suits his personality best.Investing in start-up businesses iIn 1993/1994 onwards he made 18 investments; 8 went well, and 10 failed. But the eight that made it did so well, that the return was 2.5x (250 %)a with an IRR of 16.5% p.a.Being asked about his failures he did not have enough time to go into his hourlong presentation about “How to loose millions and other valuable advice” but briefly spoke about:Three companies that went bankrupt were:1. Girmes - a great manufacturing company. It was once a textile company like Berkshire Hathaway, but turned out to be a declining business.2. Egana Goldpfeil3. Aero Inventory – a company which supplied machinery like toilets to airlines. According to Norman, thinking like an investor made him a good entrepreneur. He built up a publishing company from scratch that is flourishing with annual sales of more than 100 million Euros, which was clearly a very successful venture. Additionally, investing like an entrepreneur made him a successful investor. He is always is nearly 100% invested and tries to avoid holding cash because he has never met anyone who is able to time the market. Over the past 10 years, his investments have out-performed the DAX 5.32% annually. The 3 criteria of Warren Buffett:1. Outstanding Business. (What is the longterm sustainable competitive advantage)2. Integrity of Management. (Do they love the money or do they love what they do)3. Attractiveness of price.Investment has to fit ones personality and the approaches should be accordingly selected. A person should determine what drives him/her by asking questions like: What are my talents? What are my gifts? What do I enjoy? Where do I find fulfilment?Another important factor is that there should be no debt. “The only time when I did not sleep well was when I had a loan of DM 1 million to expand my publishing business. I felt very relieved when I had completely paid it back.”What has worked in business which can be put to work in investments:• Board• Benchmarking• Measuring (what gets measured does get done)• Test (Try everything and keep the good)• Investing is most intelligent when it is most business-like (Benjamin Graham)Disclosure: Nonehttp://www.valuewalk.com/Disclosure: Nonehttp://www.valuewalk.com/

He stated his first newsletter, die Geschäftsidee, while he was in school with 10,000 Deutschmarks earned from being a reporter for a local daily newspaper. Today, Norman Rentrop publishes 57 newsletters, loose-leaf services and magazines and three directories in the fields of marketing, public speaking, finance, investment, real estate, human resources, taxation, stocks, market analysis, business expansion and more. Founded in 1975, Verlag Norman Rentrop (“verlag” means publishing house in German), employs 220 people and more than 400 authors at its Bonn headquarters, and more than 600 people and 1,000 authors are employed worldwide. Verlag Norman Rentrop is today one of the leading information publishing companies in Germany. Its 1997 sales of 162 Million Deutschmarks (90 mio. US$) makes it the 7th largest professional information company in Germany. To help business owners achieve their goals in life, foster entrepreneurship and independence for a free and social responsible society is Rentrop publishing’s mission.
When he began in the publishing business, the German newsstands were crowded and the bookstores did not welcome newcomers. Norman turned to American-style direct marketing to grow the company; NPA, FOLIO and DMA conferences became his training camps. His training was enhanced by seminars given by visiting North American direct marketers like Joan Throckmorton, Dick Benson, Ted Nicholas, Ted Kikoler and Don Hauptman.
“We practice what I like to call ‘consultative journalism,'” said Rentrop. “I would like for every German business owner (my audience) to be able to afford consulting, and that’s what I give them through my newsletters. I think of information products as the ability to multiply ideas over the printing press and electronically.”
Norman is famous for inviting American publishers to tour his operations in Bonn and reciprocally visiting U.S. publishing operations. “By exchanging ideas and comparing how we do in different areas we can all optimize our publishing successes.”
“His case studies of actual successes and failures presented at NPA special publishers conferences are very remembered of,” says NPA executive director Patti Wysocki.
Verlag Norman Rentrop spends a lot of money on developing people and new products. There is a heavy emphasis on investing in people. They budget one month’s salary for training each year per employee. His company sent 18 employees to the NPA International Newsletter Conference last June – from Germany. They also budget between $150,000 – $200,000 on books, magazines, newsletters and other information products, which averages $1,000 per employee (in addition to the one month’s salary for training). “My philosophy is that if you give, you will receive,” said Norman. “I invest in my people and they will work hard for me in return and help to grow my company.”
Back in 1987 Verlag Norman Rentrop was one of the very first German publishing companies to introduce profit center managers – the concept of intrapreneurs. “By empowering my profit center managers to make all the decisions as if it were their own company and incentivising them by phantom stock. My people love the system for the freedom and I can concentrate on the big picture.”
On a recent business trip to the U.S., Norman dropped in at a Barnes & Noble bookstore. He looked at about 150 books, and bought 50 books that he had shipped to Germany. “What more could you ask for,” said Norman, “all the books you could possibly want, and nice chairs and food, too.” Although Norman does enjoy visiting bookstores, he also buys books at amazon.com on the internet.
New product development and the ability to see a need in the market is one of Norman’s favorite parts of the newsletter business. He spent $50,000 with amazon.com last year on books to research new product ideas. “I love the creative process, but I also love the investment process. I study the lists, and based on the statistical validity of a test of 50,000 names, I make the determination of whether to invest in another 50,000-name mailing. That’s my favorite kind of investment.”
“Why buy the cow if you want to drink a glass of milk,” Norman asks. That explains for a lot of outsourcing at Rentrop and their partnering and enjoying minority participation.
Today, Norman has minority interests in companies around the world – in Turkey, Romania, Poland, France and the U.S. He works with the mayo Clinic Letter, Agora, Georgetown Publishing House, The Global Network and Garrett Communications, to name a few. In the case of many of these relationships, Norman takes the U.S., newsletter and translates it into German – both for language and cultural differences. For example, one newsletter has to do with etiquette. While the American and German editions are similar, cultural differences make it impossible to simply translate word for word. For example, in the United States, it is customary for the gentleman to open the door to allow the woman to go ahead. In Germany, the man goes first to thwart danger.
Norman’s first love of the newsletter business is lists. “I spend one-third of my time evaluating and cultivating mailing lists and studying SRDS and rate cards; it requires the mindset of a good investor who can calculate chances,” said Norman. The famous list guru, Dick Benson, once said that a publisher should spend one-third of their time on lists or media. “I spend 12 days a year in list meetings where I meet with publishers and profit-center managers to evaluate lists for mailings and inserts (German magazines don’t rent their mailing lists, but do take inserts); it’s one of the most important elements of direct marketing.”

Publishers Profile: Norman Rentrop

Norman turned to American-style direct marketing to grow the company; NPA, FOLIO and DMA conferences became his training camps. His training was enhanced by seminars given by visiting North American direct marketers like Joan Throckmorton, Dick Benson, Ted Nicholas, Ted Kikoler and Don Hauptman. 
„I practice what I like to call ‚consultative journalism,‘“ said Norman. „I would like for every German business owner (my audience) to be able to afford consulting, and that’s what I give them through my newsletters. I think of information products as the ability to multiply ideas over the printing press and electronically.“ 
For those of you who don’t know Norman, the best way I can describe him is as a sponge of information. Norman, who lives in Germany, has probably visited more U.S. publishing companies than any U.S. publisher, always wanting to know how other publishers run their businesses, always wanting to improve how he runs his business. 
Verlag Norman Rentrop spends a lot of money on developing people and new products. There is a heavy emphasis on investing in people. They budget one month’s salary each year per employee. His company sent 18 employees to the NPA International Newsletter Conference in 1998 – from Germany.

He looked at about 150 books and bought 50 books that he had shipped to Germany. „What more could you ask for?“ said Norman, „All the books you could possibly want, and nice chairs and food, too.“ Although Norman does enjoy visiting bookstores, he also enjoys buying books through Amazon.com on the Internet. While he skims through a lot of books, Norman claims to read only two or three books per month. 
If asked who he admires, Norman will tell you he emulates Warren Buffet. Whereas Warren Buffet is a sort of contrarian on Wall Street, Norman may be a bit of a contrarian to the newsletter business. While most newsletter publishers are sole owners of their publishing companies, Norman owns minority interests in many other companies besides his own. Most publishers would prefer to maintain control over their business, but Norman is happy to own a minority. 
„Why buy the cow if you want to dringk a glass of milk?“ Norman asks. Norman’s philosophy toward newsletter publishing is that of a shareholder. Let’s say you invest in 500 shares of one particular stock on the New York Stock Exchange. You own a minority interest in it, and your investment in the company, while you expect to make money, buys you little power and control. You can, of course, show up at the shareholder’s meeting, but how much effect could you expect to have? 
Today, Norman has minority interests in companies around the world – in Turkey, Romania, Poland, France and the U.S. He works with the Mayo Clinic Letter, Agora, Georgetown Publishing House and Garrett Communications, to name a few. In the case of many of these relationships, Norman takes the U.S. newsletter and translates it into German – both for language and culture differences.

Norman Rentrop is the first of five children of Friedhelm Rentrop, CPA. In 1975 he founded Rentrop publishing. He made his A-Levels at the Jesuit boarding school Aloisiuskolleg in Bonn. Having been an exchange student to England he got his business idea: publishing a business magazine called Die Geschäftsidee which still is one of the flagship publications of his publishing company, which focuses on publishing newsletters and looseleaf services.[4]
