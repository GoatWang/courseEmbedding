About NISACompany Profile
About NISA
NISA manages portfolios for some of the largest institutional investors in the world. Client portfolios include investment-grade fixed income, derivative overlays and index-like equity investments. NISA is 100% employee-owned and is based in St. Louis, Missouri. Members of our experienced senior leadership team provide guidance for the firm through the Management Committee and Investment Committee. We employ over 225 people, approximately one quarter of whom have a participation interest in the firm.
History
Background and Founding
NISA’s founders, Jess Yawitz and Bill Marshall, began their careers as professors at Washington University in St. Louis, where they were early pioneers in research on fixed income investing and the concepts of interest rate risk management and immunization. After leaving academia to work on Wall Street, Jess and Bill returned to St. Louis, founding NISA Investment Advisors, LLC in 1994 as a firm focused on fixed income investing for large institutional investors.
Growth in Clients and Assets
Since its inception, NISA has maintained discipline regarding both clients and assets. Large, risk-controlled and liability-aware portfolios have been a mainstay since the company’s founding. Product expansion has generally been a direct result of client input.

We manage growth carefully, typically adding a limited number of new relationships each year. Fundamental to this discipline has been a continuous expansion of staff in advance of workload demands.
Future
We anticipate a continuation of our measured growth, in terms of assets, clients and employees. From time to time we have discussions with clients regarding extending our investment style and approach to new products and markets (e.g., management of investment grade bond portfolios in non-US dollar regions), which will likely lead to a gradual expansion of investment products.
We believe our independence is a strength, and we have no current plans to affiliate with any other entity or change our ownership structure, other than a continued expansion of ownership among employees.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.
Learn More



Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.
Get Started

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.
