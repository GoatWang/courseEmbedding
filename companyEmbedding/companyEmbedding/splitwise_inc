Do not refresh


            It would have been excellent If it had rupee sign instead of dollar.... Plus I can't delete my friends. There suppose to be an option where I can delete them.

            Though its a third party app, it does its job well. There interface is good, its clean and simple. The reason I didn't gave 5⭐ is it doesn't support push notifications. You won't get a notification when there is any update on splitwise. Also you cannot attach bills and bills doesn't show up when attached by Android or iOS users. Text update are also not updated.

Could be perfect


            The app has all the basic features with a good ux. Clean and simple to use. As others have noted, only if I could edit the expense after adding it, it will be perfect.

We do the math for you

We’re fairness experts
            How should we split the cost of rent? At what point is a girlfriend a roommate? Participate in cool fairness research and get advice on all sorts of common sharing problems.

What is Splitwise?

        Splitwise is a Providence, RI based company that makes it easy to split bills with friends and family. We organize all your shared expenses and IOUs in one place, so that everyone can see who they owe. Whether you are sharing a ski vacation, splitting rent with roommates, or owe someone for lunch, Splitwise makes life easier. We store data “in the cloud,” so that you can access it anywhere: on iPhone, Android, or on your computer.
      
We focus on fairness

        Most people want to be fair to each other, but sometimes they forget, or can’t decide on what fair is. In addition to helping people honor their debts, we provide mediation advice about fairness issues through our “fairness calculators.” These calculators turn our crowdsourced data into a neutral fairness opinion about your personal situation.
