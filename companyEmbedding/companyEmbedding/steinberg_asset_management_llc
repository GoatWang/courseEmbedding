Investment 
                  Process
SAM’s  research process is designed to uncover investments with extraordinary or  asymmetric risk/reward profiles (i.e. Steinberg Stocks).  Fundamental analysis is SAM’s primary  research tool in selecting securities.  
SAM’s  process is focused on understanding the key revenue drivers, margin profile and  financial posture of a company’s business(es), beyond typical company reporting  and sell-side analysis, and identifying the primary sources of earnings and  positive free cash flows.  This method of  analysis allows SAM’s analysts to better understand businesses and engage in a  far more robust and involved conversation with management teams.  
The following evaluations are integral to every analysis: 

Business Evaluation 


Communication with Management 


Risk / Reward


Invest in the Understandable 


 Three to Five-Year Strategic Investment Horizon 



Identify "Free Calls"  


Establish a Target Entry Price 

 
 
When used by SAM in   describing its investment philosophy “free call” refers to a future event or   transaction that may or may not occur, the value of which is not reflected in a   company’s share price.  For example, it could be the potential appreciation of  intellectual property or increased demand for a product.  This event or   transaction when realized serves as a long-term catalyst for the share price and   will, in SAM’s estimation, add value to the company that will be reflected in a   higher share price as the market recognizes this.  SAM is not implying that an   investor receives securities or options in securities for no cost by use of the   term “free call”.
