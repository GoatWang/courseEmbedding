Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]




Peltz's children, Will and Nicola, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival


Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]
Peltz resides in Bedford, New York.[2] He also owns Montsorrel, which is his house in Palm Beach, Florida[1] previously owned by Anita Young, the sister of Georgia O'Keeffe. He has recently begun a refurbishment and expansion project for the property.[47]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $1.51 billion as of February 2017. This makes him the 432nd richest person in the US.[48]
In 2005, Peltz was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[49][50][51] He is also a heavy contributor to Jewish causes.[52]
Awards and recognition[edit]
He was recognized by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as among the most influential people in global corporate governance.[53]

Tide detergent dominated the American laundry room for decades and helped make Procter & Gamble a consumer products behemoth.But consumers have increasingly been shunning premium-priced brands like Tide for cheaper versions of laundry detergent. And the detergent market is just one of many in which Procter & Gamble is battling to keep bargain-hunting customers.Across a number of its mission-critical, multibillion-dollar product lines — from Pampers diapers to Olay skin creams to Gillette razors — Procter & Gamble is fighting to retain its market share.Those struggles have now attracted the attention of Nelson Peltz, a billionaire investor and activist shareholder.

Arguing in a regulatory filing that the company was in need of a shake-up, Mr. Peltz announced on Monday that he was seeking a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble. His investment firm, Trian Fund Management, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in February. Continue reading the main story

The filing signals a ratcheting-up in the size of the corporate targets of activist investors, who through behind-the-scenes cajoling or sometimes high-profile public proxy wars try to force companies to change their strategies with an eye toward profits for themselves.Activist investing has attracted larger and larger pools of money, allowing managers like Mr. Peltz to hunt for ever-bigger corporate game. A proxy fight at Procter & Gamble, which has a market value of nearly $225 billion, would be among the biggest in corporate history.And Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is merely the latest consumer-driven company to capture the attention of activist investors.Last month, Daniel S. Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, said he would agitate for changes at Nestlé, and Jana Partners had earlier pressured the retailer Whole Foods to revamp its board. Whole Foods ultimately announced that it would sell itself to Amazon.This is not the first time that Procter & Gamble has faced activist pressure: The billionaire William A. Ackman pushed the board to oust Robert A. McDonald as chief executive in 2013, prompting Mr. McDonald’s predecessor, Alan G. Lafley, to return to the post from retirement.

Companies with mature consumer brands — like Procter & Gamble, with its Tide detergent and Gillette razors — can be ripe targets for activists because their days of surging growth are often well behind them.While companies may want to keep the brands, enjoying the cash they can generate, activist investors tend to be more aggressive in their approach. They often look for ways to sell the brands and reinvest in new technologies or brands that can generate better growth opportunities, said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, a firm that consults with companies and funds on activist campaigns. (Mr. Park is not involved in Mr. Peltz’s crusade with Procter & Gamble.)

That Procter & Gamble has become the quarry for activist investors is a sign of how far the once-iconic giant has fallen.For years, Procter & Gamble attracted the best-and-brightest marketing M.B.A.s from the nation’s top schools. It spurred many a Harvard Business School study of its internal methodologies and disruptive innovations. And it was the home to many big consumer hits, like the Swiffer duster and Crest Whitestrips.But thanks in no small part to lackluster economic growth overseas, combined with a strong dollar, Procter & Gamble has had 13 consecutive quarters of sales declines. Its shares have lagged behind the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.The company is on its third chief executive, David Taylor, in eight years. It is slashing billions of dollars in costs and shrinking its work force.

To meet the challenges, Procter & Gamble has moved quickly to reduce its portfolio of brands, selling about 40 beauty brands, including CoverGirl makeup and Clairol Nice ’n Easy hair coloring, to Coty last year.But analysts say what has gone missing from Procter & Gamble is innovation, new products or designs that will spur top-line growth.“Olay hasn’t grown in years,” said Mark Astrachan, an analyst with Stifel Financial. “Pantene has been relaunched I don’t know how many times at this point. On shaving, it was not focused on the fact the market was moving online and to products offered at a lower price point. It didn’t launch a shaving club until it had lost considerable market share.”And while the company is beginning to lower the prices of its goods to compete with less expensive products, the prices of its brands are, on average, 40 percent higher than the average price in the category, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein Research. Tide is twice the average price in the laundry detergent arena, Mr. Dibadj said.









 



For now, Mr. Peltz has emphasized cutting costs and trimming the layers of management bureaucracy at Procter & Gamble, but not much else.

Since taking its stake in Procter & Gamble in February, Trian had held about a half-dozen meetings with the company, outlining its arguments, according to two people briefed on the matter. The company made its own counterarguments, including asking for more time to prove the worth of its current strategy.Those discussions reached a head last week when Procter & Gamble formally declined to give Mr. Peltz a seat.In a statement on Monday, the company said it had had “an active and constructive dialogue” with Trian. It also said that its board was “confident that the changes being made are producing results” and that it “expresses complete support for the company’s strategy, plans and management.”Trian said Monday that it was not seeking to break up Procter & Gamble — a well-worn tactic of activists — or seeking to replace David S. Taylor, who has been the company’s chief executive for less than two years. If Mr. Peltz is elected, Trian said, the firm will renominate the director who had been defeated, effectively expanding Procter & Gamble’s board by one seat.For the most part, Trian has tended to apply pressure behind the scenes with corporate management, a self-described “constructivist” tact. Mr. Peltz meets regularly with management teams and board members, often discussing lengthy analyses that the firm has put together. (The firm’s “white paper” on General Electric ran to about 80 pages.)Since setting up Trian in 2005, Mr. Peltz and his partners, Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, had resorted to proxy fights just twice before Procter & Gamble. That is out of 23 campaigns at 20 companies, according to data from FactSet.Trian’s win rate in its proxy fights is 50 percent. In the battle against the ketchup maker Heinz for board seats, Trian won two of the five seats it sought. But with the chemical maker DuPont, shareholders rejected Trian outright and re-elected all of the sitting directors, although the company’s chief executive, Ellen J. Kullman, retired five months later, after the company fell short on financial performance targets.People with knowledge of Trian’s interactions with Procter & Gamble stressed that the discussions had been cordial, with the two sides agreeing on a number of issues.While Mr. Peltz has not signaled any interest in breaking up Procter & Gamble, some analysts say that could still be the ultimate outcome.

“For almost a decade, they have been talking about improvement, and for all of their efforts and advantages, I haven’t seen it play out at all,” said Mr. Dibadj, the Bernstein analyst, who has advocated a breakup of the company. “This is an organization that is simply too big and too complex.”

 Correction: July 19, 2017  
An article on Tuesday about efforts by the investor Nelson Peltz to gain a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble misstated the name of the company that bought beauty brands from Procter & Gamble last year. It is Coty, not Cody.

That Procter & Gamble has become the quarry for activist investors is a sign of how far the once-iconic giant has fallen.For years, Procter & Gamble attracted the best-and-brightest marketing M.B.A.s from the nation’s top schools. It spurred many a Harvard Business School study of its internal methodologies and disruptive innovations. And it was the home to many big consumer hits, like the Swiffer duster and Crest Whitestrips.But thanks in no small part to lackluster economic growth overseas, combined with a strong dollar, Procter & Gamble has had 13 consecutive quarters of sales declines. Its shares have lagged behind the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.The company is on its third chief executive, David Taylor, in eight years. It is slashing billions of dollars in costs and shrinking its work force.

To meet the challenges, Procter & Gamble has moved quickly to reduce its portfolio of brands, selling about 40 beauty brands, including CoverGirl makeup and Clairol Nice ’n Easy hair coloring, to Coty last year.But analysts say what has gone missing from Procter & Gamble is innovation, new products or designs that will spur top-line growth.“Olay hasn’t grown in years,” said Mark Astrachan, an analyst with Stifel Financial. “Pantene has been relaunched I don’t know how many times at this point. On shaving, it was not focused on the fact the market was moving online and to products offered at a lower price point. It didn’t launch a shaving club until it had lost considerable market share.”And while the company is beginning to lower the prices of its goods to compete with less expensive products, the prices of its brands are, on average, 40 percent higher than the average price in the category, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein Research. Tide is twice the average price in the laundry detergent arena, Mr. Dibadj said.









 



For now, Mr. Peltz has emphasized cutting costs and trimming the layers of management bureaucracy at Procter & Gamble, but not much else.

Since taking its stake in Procter & Gamble in February, Trian had held about a half-dozen meetings with the company, outlining its arguments, according to two people briefed on the matter. The company made its own counterarguments, including asking for more time to prove the worth of its current strategy.Those discussions reached a head last week when Procter & Gamble formally declined to give Mr. Peltz a seat.In a statement on Monday, the company said it had had “an active and constructive dialogue” with Trian. It also said that its board was “confident that the changes being made are producing results” and that it “expresses complete support for the company’s strategy, plans and management.”Trian said Monday that it was not seeking to break up Procter & Gamble — a well-worn tactic of activists — or seeking to replace David S. Taylor, who has been the company’s chief executive for less than two years. If Mr. Peltz is elected, Trian said, the firm will renominate the director who had been defeated, effectively expanding Procter & Gamble’s board by one seat.For the most part, Trian has tended to apply pressure behind the scenes with corporate management, a self-described “constructivist” tact. Mr. Peltz meets regularly with management teams and board members, often discussing lengthy analyses that the firm has put together. (The firm’s “white paper” on General Electric ran to about 80 pages.)Since setting up Trian in 2005, Mr. Peltz and his partners, Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, had resorted to proxy fights just twice before Procter & Gamble. That is out of 23 campaigns at 20 companies, according to data from FactSet.Trian’s win rate in its proxy fights is 50 percent. In the battle against the ketchup maker Heinz for board seats, Trian won two of the five seats it sought. But with the chemical maker DuPont, shareholders rejected Trian outright and re-elected all of the sitting directors, although the company’s chief executive, Ellen J. Kullman, retired five months later, after the company fell short on financial performance targets.People with knowledge of Trian’s interactions with Procter & Gamble stressed that the discussions had been cordial, with the two sides agreeing on a number of issues.While Mr. Peltz has not signaled any interest in breaking up Procter & Gamble, some analysts say that could still be the ultimate outcome.

“For almost a decade, they have been talking about improvement, and for all of their efforts and advantages, I haven’t seen it play out at all,” said Mr. Dibadj, the Bernstein analyst, who has advocated a breakup of the company. “This is an organization that is simply too big and too complex.”

 Correction: July 19, 2017  
An article on Tuesday about efforts by the investor Nelson Peltz to gain a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble misstated the name of the company that bought beauty brands from Procter & Gamble last year. It is Coty, not Cody.

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]




Peltz's children, Will and Nicola, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival


Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]
Peltz resides in Bedford, New York.[2] He also owns Montsorrel, which is his house in Palm Beach, Florida[1] previously owned by Anita Young, the sister of Georgia O'Keeffe. He has recently begun a refurbishment and expansion project for the property.[47]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $1.51 billion as of February 2017. This makes him the 432nd richest person in the US.[48]
In 2005, Peltz was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[49][50][51] He is also a heavy contributor to Jewish causes.[52]
Awards and recognition[edit]
He was recognized by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as among the most influential people in global corporate governance.[53]

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A.

Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]

In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]

This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc.

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]

Over the past two years, P&G has accomplished the most significant portfolio transformation in its history, having divested, discontinued, or consolidated more than 100 brands and simplified its product portfolio from 16 to 10 categories. At the same time, the Company has established a new standard of excellence for product performance, packaging and commercial execution, and is further strengthening its organization design, culture and accountability to ensure the strongest and most efficient operational performance across the organization. Today, P&G is a leaner, more agile, more accountable and more efficient organization with leadership positions in 10 large, structurally attractive categories.  The Company also continues to execute on bold productivity initiatives, having delivered more than $10 billion in savings over the past five fiscal years, with plans to deliver up to an additional $10 billion over the next five fiscal years. From reducing the number of manufacturing sites and simplifying its manufacturing platforms, to streamlining agency costs and refining its geographic footprint, the Company's initiatives are enhancing value across the organization. In addition to driving cost savings, these productivity programs have led to an increase of more than two points in operating margin over the past four years. At the same time, P&G is committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top-line growth. For example, the Company will reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, as well as product sampling and in-store and online demand creation. P&G will also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year.

P&G Responds to Trian Fund Management, L.P.
P&G Responds to Trian Fund Management, L.P.

07/17/2017
  P&G Responds to Trian Fund Management, L.P.    The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) today issued the following statement in response to Trian Fund Management, L.P.: 

  P&G’s Board and management team are committed to enhancing value for all shareholders and will continue to take actions to achieve this objective. P&G is actively executing its strategy to achieve balanced, sustainable long-term growth and value creation. Over the past two years, P&G has accomplished the most significant portfolio transformation in its history, having divested, discontinued, or consolidated more than 100 brands and simplified its product portfolio from 16 to 10 categories. At the same time, the Company has established a new standard of excellence for product performance, packaging and commercial execution, and is further strengthening its organization design, culture and accountability to ensure the strongest and most efficient operational performance across the organization. Today, P&G is a leaner, more agile, more accountable and more efficient organization with leadership positions in 10 large, structurally attractive categories.   The Company also continues to execute on bold productivity initiatives, having delivered more than $10 billion in savings over the past five fiscal years, with plans to deliver up to an additional $10 billion over the next five fiscal years. From reducing the number of manufacturing sites and simplifying its manufacturing platforms, to streamlining agency costs and refining its geographic footprint, the Company’s initiatives are enhancing value across the organization. In addition to driving cost savings, these productivity programs have led to an increase of more than two points in operating margin over the past four years. At the same time, P&G is committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top-line growth. For example, the Company will reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, as well as product sampling and in-store and online demand creation. P&G will also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year.   P&G also continues to focus on consistently generating strong cash flows to extend its outstanding track record of returning value to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, P&G has returned $100 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, share exchanges and share repurchases, with approximately $38 billion in value returned over fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Company recently announced a 3% increase to its quarterly dividend, marking the 127th year in which P&G paid a dividend, and the 61st consecutive year in which P&G increased the dividend. P&G expects total dividend payments to shareholders of more than $7 billion in fiscal year 2017, bringing total dividends paid over the last decade to more than $62 billion.   P&G has a best-in-class Board of Directors that is fully supportive of and actively engaged in overseeing the Company’s transformation, and is holding management accountable for delivering continued growth and success. The P&G Board comprises 11 diverse, highly qualified and experienced Directors, ten of whom are independent and four of whom have joined the Board in the last five years. P&G’s Directors are proven business leaders, many of whom have run successful businesses and led significant business and organization transformations at their respective companies. Together, the Board brings to P&G a broad range of expertise, skills and experience in strategy and leadership, productivity and cost savings, consumer and retail, technology and innovation, government, finance, marketing, and international business.   P&G has maintained an active and constructive dialogue with Trian since it made its investment in the Company. P&G’s Board and management team are keenly focused on executing the Company's strategy to drive innovation, accelerate organic sales and volume growth, improve productivity and cost structure, and strengthen P&G's organization and culture. While the Board is always willing to consider new ideas that may help drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value, the Board notes that Trian has not provided any new or actionable ideas to drive additional value for P&G shareholders beyond the continued successful execution of the strategic plan that is in place. The Board is confident that the changes being made are producing results, and expresses complete support for the Company's strategy, plans, and management.   P&G remains focused on serving the world’s consumers better than its best competitor, in every category and every country where the Company chooses to compete — creating superior shareholder value in the process.

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

					About				







Trian is a highly engaged shareowner, bringing a private equity mindset to the public markets





From Left to Right: Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May
Founded in 2005, Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”) is a multi-billion dollar investment management firm with over 50 employees. Trian is a highly engaged shareowner that combines concentrated public equity ownership with operational expertise. Leveraging the 40+ years’ operating experience of our Principals, Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, Trian seeks to invest in high quality but undervalued and underperforming public companies and to work collaboratively with management teams and boards of those companies to execute operational and strategic initiatives designed to drive long-term sustainable earnings growth for the benefit of all shareholders.




Feedback From Our Portfolio Companies





“Trian has a strong track record of working with companies to build long-term shareholder value, and has been an engaged shareholder. We appreciate their perspectives and look forward to a constructive ongoing dialogue with Trian as we execute our strategy to reshape the Company.” 1
– Jeffrey R. Immelt (Chairman and CEO of General Electric) 












“We believe that Nelson will be a valuable addition to our Board. We respect his more than 40 years of business and investment experience as well as his expertise helping consumer products companies leverage their brands and improve operating and financial performance.  We welcome his input as we deliver superior shareholder returns.” 2
– Irene Rosenfeld (Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz)












“Ed brings to our Board the perspective of a large and engaged shareholder in BNY Mellon and has a track record of working collaboratively with other boards and management teams. We welcome him and we look forward to benefiting from Trian’s insights and contributions as we continue to build value for our clients and shareholders.” 3
– Gerald Hassell (Chairman and CEO of BNY Mellon)












“We are firmly committed to enhancing value for all Sysco shareholders and always welcome constructive input toward driving long-term shareholder value.  Nelson and Josh will bring our Board an informed perspective based on their significant experience in the food products industry.
