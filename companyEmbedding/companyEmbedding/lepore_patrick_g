Lautus Pharma Announces Acquisition and Re-launch of GlyDerm Skincare Line | Business Wire
























































Lautus Pharma Announces Acquisition and 
      Re-launch of GlyDerm Skincare Line




Esterified Glycolic Acid Skincare Line to be featured at Upcoming 
      Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Meetings






American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery
AAD 72nd Annual Meeting


March 20, 2014 09:51 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SUMMIT, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lautus Pharmaceuticals, LLC announced today that it is re-launching the 
      GlyDerm brand of physician-dispensed skin care products. The company 
      will be presenting the line at the American Academy of Dermatology 
      Annual Meeting in Denver Colorado, March 21-24 and the American Society 
      of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery in San Francisco, April 24-29 as it works 
      to re-establish top of mind brand awareness with dermatologists and 
      plastic surgeons. Lautus, a privately held pharmaceutical company 
      focused on the dermatology and aesthetics market, recently acquired the 
      brand from BioZone Laboratories, Inc.
    


      The GlyDerm skincare line is built around its esterified glycolic acid 
      peels which are marketed for professional use and range in strength from 
      20-70%. Chemical peels, which include glycolic acid peels, rank as one 
      of the most popular non-surgical cosmetic procedures in the US, with 1.2 
      million peels performed last year, according to the American Society of 
      Plastic Surgeons.1 Physicians use glycolic acid peels to help 
      their patients achieve a smoother skin texture and reduce the appearance 
      of fine lines and wrinkles.
    

      “Glycolic acid, a naturally derived alpha hydroxy acid, can be 
      irritating to the skin, explains Lautus President and CEO Steve Bosacki. 
      “GlyDerm peels are uniquely formulated with a proprietary form of 
      esterified glycolic acid. Our unique esterification process creates a 
      time-released delivery of glycolic acid allowing us to deliver gentle, 
      full-potency glycolic acid without the unwanted irritation and clinical 
      unpredictability of other glycolic formulations.” http://www.glydermusa.com/glycolic-science/


      The original GlyDerm line was created by board-certified dermatologist 
      Marvin E. Klein, M.D. and has been trusted by dermatologists and plastic 
      surgeons for over 20 years. At the height of its popularity, GlyDerm was 
      sold in 30 countries. Although the brand has been continuously sold 
      since 1992, it has not been actively promoted for the past eight years.
    

      “GlyDerm is the best glycolic acid product on the market,” says Patrick 
      G. LePore, Chairman of Lautus. “Although the brand has been flying under 
      the radar in the physician-dispensed aesthetics category, it has a loyal 
      customer base from Beverly Hills to New York City because of its proven 
      track record of safety and efficacy.” To increase brand awareness and 
      drive sales, Lautus is developing a multi-faceted plan that includes a 
      dedicated sales force, customer training and marketing support and a 
      sampling program. “In addition to re-connecting with our existing 
      customers and introducing the brand to new users, we’re developing new 
      and innovative products like our Vitamin C Serum which uses QuSome® 
      technology to encapsulate L-ascorbic acid allowing it to penetrate the 
      skin to stimulate collagen synthesis and reduce the signs of aging,” 
      says Mr. LePore. http://www.glydermusa.com/glycolic-science/
