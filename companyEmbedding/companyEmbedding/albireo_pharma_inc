Albireo  » About Biliary Atresia

















Menu
 


About Biliary Atresia 

Biliary atresia is a blockage or absence of bile ducts that irreversibly prevents bile flow from the liver to the small intestine, causing accumulation of bile that damages the liver. The damage leads to scarring, loss of liver tissue and cirrhosis, which makes it difficult for the liver to remove toxins from the blood and deteriorates the liver. Biliary atresia is life threatening and a common reason for liver transplantation in children. The estimated worldwide incidence of biliary atresia is 18.5 per 100,000 births.
There are no medicines currently approved to treat biliary atresia. The typical treatment is a surgery known as the Kasai procedure, or hepatoporto-enterostomy, in which the obstructed bile ducts are removed and a section of the small intestine is connected to the liver directly. The chance of a successful Kasai procedure is best if done before two months of age. However, even with early intervention, scarring of the liver can continue, resulting in cirrhosis and eventually transplantation. Only about 25 percent of those initially undergoing the Kasai will survive into their twenties without need for liver transplantation.
The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown, but it is thought to result from an event in the womb or around the time of birth. Possible triggers may include viral or bacterial infection, an immune system malfunction, a genetic mutation, a problem during liver or bile duct development or exposure to toxic substances.

Albireo Pharma, Inc. Key Developments

Albireo Pharma, Inc. Announces Key Study Design Details for its Planned Phase 3 Program of Lead Product Candidate, A4250
May 18 17
Albireo Pharma, Inc. announced key study design details for its planned Phase 3 program of lead product candidate, A4250, in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) determined following consultations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). PFIC is a rare and life-threatening genetic liver disorder for which there are currently no approved drug therapies. Albireo’s planned Phase 3 PFIC program includes a single randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, six-month treatment clinical trial designed to enroll 60 patients and an open label long-term extension study. The primary endpoint for FDA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for EMA evaluation, will be an assessment of change in pruritus. The primary endpoint for EMA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for FDA evaluation, will be serum bile acid (sBA) responder rate. Elevated sBA levels are associated with the pathogenesis of PFIC, and pruritus is a common and debilitating symptom of the disease. The trial will also have several additional secondary endpoints. Patients in the trial will have the opportunity to participate in the open label extension study to assess long-term safety and durability of response. The planned double blind Phase 3 trial, together with available data from the then-ongoing extension study, are expected to form the primary support for drug approval applications for A4250 in both the United States and European Union for the treatment of patients with PFIC. In a recently completed open label Phase 2 clinical trial in children with cholestatic liver diseases, most patients showed both an improvement in pruritus across multiple scales and a reduction in serum bile acid levels after four weeks of treatment with A4250. There were no serious adverse events determined to be treatment-related observed in the trial, and most adverse events, including some increased transaminases, were mild, transient and assessed as not treatment related. A4250 exhibited a favorable overall tolerability profile in the trial. In parallel with the planned Phase 3 program, Albireo is supporting an independent research study that is pooling and analyzing long-term PFIC patient data from a number of academic centers to support the clinical utility of the reduction of sBAs in the treatment of PFIC. Albireo plans to submit the findings from the study when available to both the FDA and EMA in support of its anticipated drug approval applications for A4250.


Albireo Pharma, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 10 17
Albireo Pharma, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company’s revenue was $1,000 against $124,000 a year ago. The decrease was due to a reduction in procurement services performed for EA Pharma. Operating loss was $6,097,000 against $2,624,000 a year ago. Net loss before income tax was $6,671,000 against $3,239,000 a year ago. Net loss was $6,671,000 against $3,239,000 a year ago. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $1.06 against $12.20 a year ago.


Albireo Pharma, Inc. to Discuss Preliminary Data from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of A4250
Apr 22 17
Albireo Pharma, Inc. announced that the embargo on its late-breaker abstract discussing preliminary data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of its lead product candidate A4250 in children with cholestatic liver disease has been lifted and the data will be presented at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 in Amsterdam. The data demonstrated improvement in pruritus and reduction in serum bile acids (sBA) in most patients, particularly patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), after four weeks of treatment with A4250. A4250 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) that has minimal systemic exposure. The open label, multicenter, dose finding Phase 2 trial assessed the safety and tolerability of A4250 and explored changes in sBA levels and pruritus. Nineteen patients aged one to 17 years old with a pediatric cholestatic liver disease, including PFIC (subtype 1, 2 or 3), Alagille syndrome, biliary atresia or intrahepatic cholestasis, were enrolled in the trial’s first five cohorts. Five different doses of A4250 were evaluated, ranging from 10 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg. A4250 reduced mean levels of sBA in all five dose groups, with substantial sBA reductions observed in seven of nine PFIC patients (ranging from 43% to 98%). In addition, 14 of 19 patients showed improvement in pruritus using a visual analogue scale (VAS-Itch 0-10). The dose showed a mean decrease of 2.86 points from baseline. The trial was not powered for formal statistical analyses. The data showed a significant correlation between reduction in sBA and improvement of pruritus. In addition, no treatment-related serious adverse events were observed, and A4250 was well tolerated. Subsequent to the submission date for ILC, the trial’s remaining patients completed the study.

Albireo’s Lead Product Candidate for Orphan Pediatric Liver Disease Accepted Into European Medicines Agency’s PRIME Program
Program designed to speed up evaluation of investigational medicines for diseases with unmet medical need
BOSTON, Nov. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Albireo Pharma, Inc.   (NASDAQ:ALBO), a   clinical-stage orphan pediatric liver disease company developing novel bile acid   modulators, announced today that its lead product candidate, A4250, has been   granted access to the PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) program of the European   Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic   cholestasis (PFIC). 

“PFIC is a highly debilitating genetic liver disorder that is life altering   for affected children and their families,” said Ron Cooper, President and Chief   Executive Officer of Albireo.  “There is an urgent need for an effective   pharmacological treatment for PFIC, as there are currently no approved drug   options in the United States or Europe.  A4250’s acceptance into the PRIME   program serves as validation of its promise to meet that need.  We look forward   to collaborating with the EMA on the development plan for A4250, as well as the   potential accelerated assessment of A4250 in Europe.”
The PRIME program was launched by the EMA to provide enhanced support to   developers of investigational medicines that target an unmet medical need, with   a focus on those that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing   treatments or address a disease with no current treatment option.  The program   is designed to provide early engagement with the EMA to optimize development   plans and speed up evaluation, with the goal of helping patients benefit as   early as possible from therapies that may significantly improve their quality of   life.  As of August 2016, only 13 out of 57 requests for PRIME eligibility had   been accepted into the program.  Having been accepted into the program, A4250   may be eligible for accelerated assessment of a potential future marketing   authorization application (MAA) in Europe.
A4250 is currently being evaluated in children with chronic cholestasis in a   Phase 2 clinical trial that is intended to support a potentially pivotal   clinical trial in PFIC planned to be conducted in the United States and Europe.    Albireo anticipates meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   regarding the planned PFIC trial in the first quarter of 2017.  
About A4250
  A4250 is a first-in-class product candidate   in development for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and   potentially other orphan pediatric cholestatic liver diseases.  A4250 is a   highly potent and selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT),   has minimal systemic exposure and acts locally in the gut.  A4250 is currently   being evaluated in children with chronic cholestasis in a Phase 2 clinical trial   that is intended to support a potentially pivotal clinical trial in PFIC.
About Progressive Familial Intrahepatic   Cholestasis
  Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is   a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive, life-threatening liver disease,   which may start early after birth or at a young age and rapidly progress to   end-stage liver disease.  Three alternative gene defects have been identified   that correlate to three separate PFIC subtypes, known as types 1, 2 and 3.  The   precise prevalence of PFIC is unknown, but PFIC has been estimated to affect   between one in every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide.
PFIC is commonly associated with elevated serum bile acids.  Prominent   symptoms of PFIC include pruritus, which is associated with severe sleep   disturbance and diminished overall quality of life, and poor growth. First-line   treatment in PFIC is typically off-label ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).    Notwithstanding treatment with UDCA, many PFIC patients will require partial   external biliary diversion (PEBD) surgery and ultimately liver transplantation.    Although success rates vary, published third-party studies have shown that PEBD   surgery can slow, and in some cases stop, the progression of liver disease and   lead to reduced pruritus and improved sleep.
About Albireo  
  Albireo Pharma is a clinical-stage   biopharmaceutical company focused through its operating subsidiary on the   development of novel bile acid modulators to treat orphan pediatric liver   diseases and other liver and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. Albireo’s   clinical pipeline includes two Phase 2 product candidates and one Phase 3   product candidate. Albireo was spun out from AstraZeneca in 2008.
Albireo Pharma is located in Boston, Massachusetts, and its key operating   subsidiary is located in Gothenburg, Sweden. For more information on Albireo,   please visit www.albireopharma.com.

Albireo Pharma, Inc.: Initiation of Research Coverage

            Wednesday, January 25, 2017







William Blair & Company initiated research coverage of Albireo Pharma, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on developing novel bile acid modulators for the treatment of orphan pediatric liver diseases and gastrointestinal disorders.
Analyst Katherine Xu estimated that the company’s lead asset, A4250, would have $570 million in worldwide peak sales in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), with a 60% probability of success, or $55 per share.
“Albireo Pharma is a leader in developing bile acid modulators to treat liver and gastrointestinal diseases,” Xu said. “Lead asset A4250 is wrapping up a proof-of-concept Phase II study and is poised to enter Phase III testing, targeting the pediatric orphan indication PFIC, in mid-2017, with data expected in mid-2018. A number of rare pediatric cholestatic diseases, including PFIC, are caused by improper flow and elimination of bile acids, resulting in toxic buildup in the liver and eventually cirrhosis and premature death. A once-daily oral therapy, A4250 is an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor that reduces bile acid return to the liver and facilitates excretion through the colon, while also improving major disease symptoms such as pruritus. Behind A4250, elobixibat, a first-generation IBAT inhibitor, expects approval in Japan in chronic constipation in early 2018.”
William Blair is a global investment banking and asset management firm. We are committed to building enduring relationships with our clients and providing expertise and solutions to meet their evolving needs. An independent and employee-owned firm, William Blair is based in Chicago, with offices in 18 cities across four continents.

					Full Description



Albireo Pharma, Inc., formerly Biodel Inc., incorporated on December 8, 2003, is a specialty biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of bile acid modulators to treat orphan pediatric liver diseases and gastrointestinal (GI), disorders where improper flow or absorption of bile causes medical conditions for which there is unmet need. The target indication for its lead product candidate, A4250, is progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), which is a genetic disorder affecting children. Other products in the Company's pipeline include Elobixibat, A3384 and Bile Acid Modulators.A4250A4250 is a potent and selective inhibitor of intracapsular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) that is designed to reduce bile acid reabsorption from the small intestine to the liver, leading to reduced levels of bile acids in the serum and liver and increased excretion of bile acids via the colon. A4250 is being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in children with chronic cholestasis. In addition to PFIC and subject to obtaining additional capital, the Company focuses on conducting clinical development of A4250 as a treatment for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders.ElobixibatElobixibat is indicated for the treatment of chronic constipation. Elobixibat has completed its Phase III clinical trials. Elobixibat is also an IBAT inhibitor. By inhibiting reabsorption of bile acids from the small intestine to the liver, Elobixibat manages the flow of bile acid to the colon.A3384A3384 is a formulation of cholestyramine that is designed to release cholestyramine directly in the colon. The Company is developing A3384 as a treatment for bile acid malabsorption (BAM). The Company has completed a Phase II clinical trial of a prior formulation of A3384 in BAM and is in the late-stages of a subsequent pharmaceutical development program designed to identify an optimized formulation of A3384 capable of delivering cholestyramine to the colon.
