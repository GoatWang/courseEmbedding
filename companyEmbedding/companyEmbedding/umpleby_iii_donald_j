Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Can China make the reflation trade great again?
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch –

Jitters over Beijing's credit crackdown fade. Can China reinvigorate the so-called reflation trade? A surge in industrial metals prices is attracting attention.

                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    2:14 AM ET 07/28/2017
                                                


Japan's Komatsu Ltd (KMTUF) reported a 76 percent surge in first-quarter profit due to a doubling in sales of earth-moving equipment in China, the latest sign of a global recovery in spending in the construction and mining sector. The company said operating profit for the three months through end-June rose to 52.4 billion yen from 29.8 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.

















                                                    Strong U.S. corporate earnings to continue as dollar remains weak
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    1:59 PM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


The S&P 500 index is on track to post back-to-back, double-digit quarterly earnings growth for the first time in almost six years, and the trend could continue as a weak U.S. dollar and global growth help boost results. More companies are beating analyst estimates than the recent average, and they are doing it by wider margins than they have since 2010, according to Reuters data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday enjoyed a 100- point gain, powered by potent rallies in Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), and McDonald's Corp. (MCD), even as a tumble in 3 M Co. exacted a mighty toll from the blue-chip gauge. Shares of 3 M Co. slashed about 70 points from the Dow and helped the the maker of Post-it Notes, Scotch tape and Ace bandages post its worst-ever daily price decline on record, off $10.61, or 5.1%, according to WSJ Market Data Group, tracking data going back to 1972.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Tuesday notched fresh all-time highs as Wall digested an array of better-than-expected corporate-results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 100 points, or 0.5%, but the blue-chip average's advance was limited by a plunge in shares of component 3 M Co., which marked its sharpest-ever net drop on a dollar-basis on record, off $10.61, or down 5.1%, according to WSJ Market Data Group, tracking data going back to 1972.

Revenue rises from a year ago for second straight quarter, snapping a nine-quarter streak of declines. Shares of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) shot up to the highest level in over five years, as the farming and mining equipment maker's results confirmed what investors seemed to already know, that business had bottomed a while ago. The company reported early Tuesday earnings and revenue that beat expectations and raised its outlook.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
