Silchester International Investors investment philosophy























We focus on maximising intrinsic value which we define as the earnings, assets and dividends provided by our companies and aggregated within the portfolio. We implement this by a strong price discipline - lower multiples of earnings, assets and dividends means more earnings, assets and dividends at the outset - and by a quality appraisal which seeks to identify companies capable of increasing earnings, assets and dividends by their own efforts. We believe that a successful accumulation of intrinsic value leads to a good investment return. Silchester believes that this approach, a focus on one product, our independence as an investment firm and our commitment to limiting client assets and client numbers are important strengths.
