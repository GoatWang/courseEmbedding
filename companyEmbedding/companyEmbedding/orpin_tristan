Illumina, Inc.. (6/30/14). "Press Release: Biomnis, Genoma, and the Center for Human Genetics and Laboratory Diagnostics Martinsried, Enter Agreements with Illumina to Expand Access for Non-invasive Prenatal Testing Across Europe". San Diego, CA.
Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) today announced that it has entered into separate agreements with Biomnis, Genoma, and the Center for Human Genetics and Laboratory Diagnostics Martinsried, under which they will use the HiSeq 2500 and consumables from Illumina to develop and perform non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Biomnis plans to make NIPT available in France, Genoma plans to perform NIPT services in Italy, and the Center for Human Genetics and Laboratory Diagnostics will offer NIPT in Germany.

"Biomnis evaluated the different technologies and selected Illumina because of their high level of performance as published in respected, peer-reviewed medical journals," said Dr. Charles Woler, CEO of Biomnis Laboratories. "Backed by whole genome sequencing, we look forward to making our highly accurate test accessible to physicians and their patients."

"We are excited to offer NIPT through our network with the use of Illumina's technology," said Dr. Francesco Fiorentino, CEO and Director of Genoma Group Laboratories. "After evaluating different offerings, we selected Illumina's technology for its deep sequencing capabilities. We are continuously trying to improve our service and offerings for patients and healthcare providers, and we believe our physician customers and the expectant families they work with will be thrilled to have access to this important information in an accurate, safe, and efficient manner."

"We decided on a partnership with Illumina because we share common values regarding delivering high quality products and services," said Dr. Hanns-Georg Klein, CEO of the Center for Human Genetics and Laboratory Diagnostics Martinsried. "One of the reasons we founded The Prenatalis Consortium was to set standards and to further develop applications of NIPT in close cooperation with leading prenatal centers in Germany. It is crucial to integrate NIPT into the context of established prenatal diagnostics including ultrasound, invasive prenatal diagnostics, and biochemistry."

"These agreements are another step in establishing Illumina as a global leader in reproductive and genetic health solutions and as a valued partner for NGS-based testing across a broad range of clinical applications," said Tristan Orpin, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Reproductive and Genetic Health for Illumina.
