2221 Broadway/ 265 West 79 Street (First Baptist Church)

Summary of site plans and status
At the corner of 79 Street and Broadway stands the First Baptist Church, which is home to the oldest Baptist congregation in the United States, founded in 1753. The Church’s entrance is positioned diagonally to the intersection, and features tall slender turrets, extraordinary stained glass windows, and a distinctive red tiled roof.
Early in the autumn of 2006, several congregants approached Council Member Gale Brewer about possible plans to demolish the Church in anticipation of a residential development. On October 22, 2006, the congregation met to discuss its options on this matter. On October 29, 2006 the New York Times published an article about the Church, “With Bowed Heads, a Flock Looks Warily Ahead,” that surveyed the Church’s possible plans. According to W. Lawrence Joachim, President of the Church’s Board of Trustees, “A couple of people have come forward with some serious ideas that we’ve been praying about for months.” Although Mr. Joachim would not give many specific details about proposals, he mentioned that the congregation was considering the pros and cons of various plans for the church.
Council Member Gale Brewer sent a letter to the Department of Buildings on October 10, 2006, requesting that no demolition permits be issued for site of the church. In addition she requested of the Landmarks Preservation Commission that the site be considered for landmark status.
On October 25, 2006, W. Lawrence Joachim, President of the Board of Trustees of the First Baptist Church, indicated in a letter that the Church is “not preparing to tear down the building. Our property is not, and never has been, for sale.” In fact, the Church has allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade the structure.
According to a letter sent from the pastor of the Church to its members, a building committee was appointed, consisting of the Pastor, the Chairman of the Deacon Board, the President of the Trustees, the Treasurer, the Church Clerk, and two “members-at-large” from the congregation. The purpose of the committee was to “investigate potential proposals relative to the redevelopment” of the “property and facility and bring a formal recommendation to the members of the First Baptist Church.”

Summary of site plans and status
At the May 2, 2006 meeting of Community Board 7, the Full Board voted to approves the application to the Department of City Planning by the Bel Canto Condominium to allow installation of glass wall, new tables and chairs, paintings, and improved signage in an existing covered plaza. CB7 also urged the Bel Canto to distribute the proposed planters throughout the public space and to make sure that access to the seating area is more flexible.
Ollie’s Noodle Shop and Grille is the first floor commercial tenant in this space.
Council Member Brewer received calls during 2006 with regard to encroachment on the public space, but City Planning Department staff researched the concern and concluded that the restaurant was living up to the agreement regarding the planters and access to seating areas.

Summary of site plans and status
In 2002, city and state officials, general contractors, building management and shop owners met regularly for six months to coordinate outreach and hiring procedures for the new Time Warner Center Building. As chair of the City Council’s technology committee, Council member Gale A. Brewer helped create a website to assist local residents find jobs in the new Time Warner Center building. The Time Warner Center’s managers Related Management Companies (subsidiary of Related Companies, the developer of both the Time Warner Center and the Gateway Center) informed the private businesses that the city offers consulting services to ensure compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity Standards, the Disability Act, and other labor laws.
For example, when the Mandarin Oriental Hotel was overwhelmed with applications, the city Department of Small Business Services narrowed down 6,000 applications to only four candidates for each open position. DSBS passed the selections to the hotel’s human resources department, which made the hiring decisions. As a result, 70 percent of the 389 new hires at the five-star hotel were from New York City: 90 Manhattanites got jobs. Brewer estimates that her West Side constituents make up 20 percent of all those hired.
Completed in 2004, the 750 feet, twin towered, multi-use complex is home to AOL Time Warner world headquarters, the 250 room/suite Mandarin Oriental Hotel, retail space, entertainment facilities, restaurants, and office space. In addition, CNN broadcasts live from the location and a concert hall is on site for the use of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Time Warner owns one third of the complex.

Summary of site plans and status
UPDATE: 12/27/07
The Department of Buildings has issued a stop work order on the development and has also revoked previously issued work permits for excavation and foundation work for failing to address objections raised by the Department of Buildings.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
UPDATE: 11/21/07
Development director, Lynette Tulkoff, said that the 19-floor, $200 million project should start after Thanksgiving 2007. The development will include 196 rental apartments. The retail space will have 22-foot-high glass storefronts. The development should be at full occupancy by the end of 2009.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
UPDATE: 11/12/07
Demolition permit issued 1/29/07 expiries 1/1/08.
The demolition of the buildings on site have been completed as of this date.
The Colonial Club was built in 1892 by architect Henry Kilburn. The 1892 Real Estate Record and Guide described the Colonial Club as a “Colonial Palazzo , merging rich Renaissance forms with light Adam-style detailing.” It was made of Bedford limestone on the ground floor and pale yellow Roman brick and gray terra cotta from the second to sixth stories.
Council Member Gale Brewer wrote (11/23/05) to Robert Tierney, Chair, NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) requesting that this site (the Colonial Club) be landmarked, or that the Upper West Side/Central Park West Historic District be extended to include this address. The Landmarks Preservation Commission wrote back (~11/30/05) requesting photographs, which Council Member Gale A. Brewer’s office sent on 12/13/05. The Council Member’s office has been told that Philips International Realty is the partial owner of this building (12/2/05). Rose Management managed the former building.
The effort by Landmark West! and others to landmark the Colonial Club was not successful.
A joint venture of Philips International and Rhodes NY, 2075 Broadway owns buildings at this address and plans to build a residential tower. Handel Architects are the designers.
Demolition is supposed to be completed by early 2008. This site is scheduled to have 19 stories with 49,000 sq. ft of retail space and 9,000 sq. ft. of condominium space.
This site is zoned as C4-6A: Commercial.
According to Lynette Tolkoff, the Director of Development for Rhodes Real Estate Investors and Developers, the building will be constructed by Gotham Construction. They are aiming to have the building Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified.
There is a height restriction on the building due to the zoning, and it will be 210 feet high and 19 stories. There will be 196 units, mostly studio and one-bedroom units, but there will be some two-bedroom units. The developers will start advertising for retail in September 2007, with a retail footprint of about 14,000 square feet, and 48,000 square feet of retail space total. As of August 23, 2007, there is no community space planned in the building.
The building will be rentals, and the developer has purchased 421a certificates for an off-site location, as well as inclusionary housing in the Bronx.
Council Member Gale Brewer has met with the development team and is supporting more community input into the residential and commercial units.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
UPDATE: 8/10/09
This as-of-right building is expected to be complete by January 2010. Commercial establishments will include a Trader Joe’s grocery store and a Bank of America branch.
