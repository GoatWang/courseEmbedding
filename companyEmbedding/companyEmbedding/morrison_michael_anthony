Charge 01: SUBSTANTIAL BATTERY                     Bond or Fine: $.00 Court File #: 07CF1310     Disposition of Charge: SENT. WSP - DODGE        Disposition Date: 2008/06/13



The Detentions Division of the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department services the secure detention needs of the criminal justice community, together with the public safety needs of the citizens of Kenosha County. This is accomplished by providing housing for pretrial detainees in a system of modern linear confinement, and sentenced persons in a direct supervision environment. All incarceration is managed by policies that hold inmates accountable for their behavior. This system of safe and appropriate housing of detainees is the product of Objective Inmate Classification, which determines risk levels. This safe and secure confinement includes responsible management, aided by community based programming providing practical life skills exposure. This creates a perpetual goal of releasing persons from confinement back into the community in a condition no worse then when they first arrived. 

The professional principles of the American Jail Association, the American Correctional Association, and the National Commission for Correctional Health Care will serve to continually guide the management and operation of these facilities. This responsible management, together with continual training of staff, will maintain effective control of Detentions Division operations in the most cost-effective manner possible.

Traffic With Anthony: Stealing Videos And Spamming YouTube - Not A Key To Success








































One More Cup of CoffeeTraffic With Anthony: Stealing Videos And Spamming YouTube – Not A Key To Success






Product Name: Traffic with Anthony
Product Owner: Anthony Morrison
Price: ?
Upsells: None
Rating: 20/100
 
What Is It?
A piece of software and training about stealing other people’s videos from YouTube and spamming YouTube channel owners in order to get free traffic.
Before You Buy:
Traffic with Anthony is one of a series of products by Anthony Morrison that is little more than a scam. Although this software is likely to bring about some extra traffic, it does so by spamming and stealing videos, approaches that do no favors for the reputation of the website owner and are not likely to have significant effects on the website owner’s sales.
What I Liked:
I’ll admit, the promotional video for this product is very slick, which does make it appealing. The start of the video actually feels more like a movie than a product advertisement. This makes it more interesting to sit through than the standard sales pitch, and it is particularly amusing if you don’t take Anthony seriously to start off with.
What I Didn’t Like:
Hype
Excessive promotion and hype is pretty much a universal standard for products that claim to help users make money online. This isn’t actually surprising, because it takes a considerable amount of convincing to get a person who is wanting to make money to believe that they have to spend money first.
Anthony implies that a large amount of money can be made through this product, although most of his boasts of profit are connected to how well he has done himself, rather than how well an average user might do. This is an intentionally misleading approach and significantly overestimates just how much money can realistically be made through his system.
Additionally, Anthony’s approach still relies on actually having a website that you are directing traffic to and you having some knowledge on how to sell products from this site. However, Anthony completely masks over this fact in his video, claiming that none of this knowledge is necessary.

This can be very misleading, particularly for people new to online business, because it suggests that it is possible to earn a large amount of money very fast using no other training than what Anthony provides.
This is completely unrealistic, and if it were possible, there would be a lot more success stories like Anthony’s, especially with how many ‘make money fast’ products that he promotes.
There aren’t, so clearly Anthony isn’t telling the whole story.
Anthony Morrison
It is true that Anthony Morrison is a success story as an internet entrepreneur and is, as he claims, a millionaire. Anthony really uses this fact to his advantages in the sales video, making use of discussions about him on television, as well as using images of himself and cars.

The video itself is snazzy, but surprisingly low quality. Also, who really cares about Anthony’s wealth or his success story?
Anthony is essentially selling himself as evidence that his product works, but this really isn’t good evidence. He spends a considerable amount of time promoting himself and his successes, so much so that you would think he is selling himself rather than a product. For a promotional video, the focus on Anthony is intentionally misleading, because it makes the audience trust him, even though he does not say much to actually earn this trust.
Sick Of Millionaire Gurus? Get Involved With Legit Marketers Who Want To See You Succeed
The thing is, Anthony didn’t become rich because he used the product or followed the approaches that he is selling in Traffic with Anthony. In reality, much of Anthony’s money comes from the fact that he sells products and systems like this one to users. He has a few different products like this, and they all strongly rely on his reputation as an ‘online genius’ to actually sell the product.
In fact, Anthony’s reputation is nowhere near as good as it seems, and he has been in trouble in the past for creating poor quality and misleading products. One of his products had so many scam reports that it ended up getting banned from Clickbank entirely, which is the affiliate service that Anthony focuses strongly on.
 
Reviews
When it comes to any product, one of the first and most important questions that people ask themselves is whether the product does what it is supposed to. It isn’t really possible to work this out from the author’s description of the product, because he is biased, and gains if you buy the product.
For a product like Traffic with Anthony, it is also important to be wary of positive reviews. Many of the people who promote Anthony’s products are affiliates, meaning that they get a proportion of any sales that they direct. Because of this, these reviewers will mask any negative aspects of the product, if not lie entirely. In fact, many of these affiliates have probably never used the product themselves and are just rewording someone else’s sales pitch.
A quick Google search on Anthony reveals considerable concern about his products, including concerns that they are scams, particularly when you ignore the over-the-top reviews that tell you the product is far too good to be true.
Negative reviews on Traffic with Anthony were a bit harder to find, mainly because of the large number of positive affiliate reviews. However, the negative reviews I read were not written from a script, while the positive ones certainly were. Review writers expressed legitimate concerns about Traffic with Anthony and the approaches that Anthony promotes. This suggests that the product is nowhere near as good as Anthony suggests.
The Product Itself
A common tactic for promoting a product like this is to convince users that the product will let them cut corners and earn money faster and with less effort than normal. In reality, making money online is very possible, but it isn’t a walk in the park. At the end of the day, an online business is much like any other business, and it does take a significant amount of time and effort to actually succeed.
If someone is offering you a shortcut, be very careful about taking it, because odds are, what they are often isn’t exactly what it appears to be.
In the case of Traffic with Anthony, the product does actually boost the traffic of the user, but it does so in a way that is a little questionable and certainly doesn’t help the reputation of the person using the software. What Anthony offers in his product is software, which does two key roles.
The first of these finds and ‘rips’ videos from YouTube based on the keyword that the user specifies. The second aspect of the software is an automated process that sends messages to channels that have the keyword the user specifies. These messages are sent to the host of the YouTube channel, asking them to put the link in the description for the video. The host then gets a proportion of any profits that are made from that link.
After all, people browse YouTube for a number of reasons, but shopping doesn’t tend to be one of them.
Traffic with Anthony is one of Anthony’s newest products, which is why there aren’t a large number of realistic reviews about it (although there are a lot of overly positive affiliate reviews already). As I mentioned before, one of the key aspects of the software that Anthony is selling is that it downloads videos from other people’s YouTube channel. Anthony then recommends that the user posts these videos on their own YouTube channel.
This is blatant stealing of content from other users, and has the potential to get the user to get in trouble.
In fact, ripping and rehosting YouTube videos is against the Terms of Services of YouTube, meaning that the user is liable to get their account banned.
Effectiveness – or lack thereof
The concept is that users of Traffic with Anthony use the ‘free’ traffic from YouTube to sell more things on their own website. This can apply to a product that the person has created and is selling, or it may be links to affiliate products.
Traffic with Anthony assumes that all traffic is equal, when in reality it is certainly not. If a person is trying to sell something on their website, then they want to attract viewers that are actually interested in buying what they are selling. Anthony’s approach does loosely target people who are interested in the topic of the author, but it doesn’t target people who want to buy.
The other problem with Anthony’s approach is that it is nothing but spam, and people have a tendency to ignore spam. This is even more significant because most people who have purchased Anthony’s product are likely to be spamming YouTube, and some of these users will be spamming the same channel owners.
The idea that the software user will split profits with the YouTube channel owner, but I highly doubt that most people would even believe it. If you were constantly getting spam from many people about hosting their link, and they would share their profits with you, would you believe them?
Probably not.
In most cases, the amount of traffic a user would get from Anthony’s approaches is likely to be considerably less than Anthony promotes.
Not for Beginners
Finally, what Anthony neglects to mention throughout much of his hype is that you do actually have to know what you are doing in terms of making money online to be able to make any use of his product. After all, extra traffic isn’t going to help anyone if they don’t have a website to direct people to and products to sell.
This might seem obvious, but Anthony’s product does appear to be targeted at people new to the field of online business, people who probably won’t know that much of what he is talking about is exaggerated.
This is not a product that someone new at online business should even attempt to use, regardless of how wonderful Anthony makes his product sound.
Final note
As a final note, one thing that I found a bit annoying about Traffic with Anthony is that it isn’t actually obvious where you to buy the product. You would expect that a product that is so highly hyped would give you multiple chances to buy instead of just one.
Who Is This Product For?
This product is best for people who are highly familiar with internet marketing and want some extra traffic from YouTube without having to put in the legwork. However, the effectiveness of the product is highly debatable, and it is likely to get users in trouble. Overall, it is best that everyone avoids this product, regardless of whether they are new or experienced users.
Final Review

What Now?
Honestly, most products that offer quick and easy ways of making money online are nowhere near as good as they seem. Most products, like this one, offer approaches that are largely ineffective and may cost additional extra just to make any money.
If you are looking to get involved in an online business your absolute best approach to find a mentor you can trust. You can get 1-on-1 support from me if you are a member of Wealthy Affiliate. I want to help you get started on the right foot!

hi – thanks for a great review, I haven’t jumped in but was going to, it all seems so plausible (even ripping off you tube videos – although how you avoid being pinged by you tube would be a feat in itself)…
I can’t believe people have lost over $2K on this clown…
It’s a Big Don’t Buy From Me Too…
cheers Bruce

I just ordered to Traffic Accelerator for $67.00. That’s all I wanted. Logged into my account and there was all kinds of stuff that would end up costing me more money that I did not ask for.  I immediately contact my credit card company to report as fraud. The was no phone number listed inside or outside to contact him. The number listed on the charge was an old number that does not work. I was issued new card and that card was cancelled.  Wish I had saw your site before jumping in.  Thanks

This is pretty much this guy’s style. Before you buy, you are special and amazing. After you buy, you are invisible.

Yes, my name is Larry Lee and I just bought some of the products last night and I’m already trying to get a REFUND!! The address he gives for a Refund: ” support@trafficwithanthony.com “———–   doesn’t pull up and says “not found”  ?????????   How the hell do I get in touch with this guy and get my $$ back?
Any suggestions would be helpful……….Thanks,    Larry Lee

Sorry about your trouble Larry. This is how these scammers operate. Chances are you will only follow up to a certain point, then it will too time consuming to bother with. With this strategy X 1000 people, Anthony is now rich, and 1000 people are 50 dollars poorer.

Thank you VERY MUCH for the HONEST Review.
I was another STUPID that got into this SCAM and lost over $2,750.
Hopefully he will pay someday/somehow.

Is Success With Anthony a Scam, Beware of this Program

Success With Anthony Review

Product Name:  Success With Anthony
Website:  www.successwithanthony.com
Price: $7, $147, $1,000’s (unethical pricing/upsells)
Owners: Anthony MorrisonSupport: Limited
Product Quality: LimitedOverall Rank: 36 out of 100 points.
Success With Anthony, The Product…
Billed as “the” perfect formula for driving traffic to your website, the Success With Anthony program makes a number of claims, some that land and some that totally fall flat. The problem is that most people will not know which is which until they have already invested their money into the program which is presented to you with your “typical” sales video.  This is the first red flag of many that I will be discussing with this review.
In addition, there are a few claims that are just completely false and those must be addressed if the program would like to earn higher reviews amongst folks in the industry.
 
Pros vs. Cons 
Pros:
There are very few pros to this program due to the over-reaching claims.  The product itself is mediocre at best.
Cons: 
The advertised “free websites” are not actually free at all.
Much of the information available comes from affiliates in the form of poorly written or poorly spun articles. Keyword stuffing is another apparent issue here.
There is a limited support system in place for new members.
The products was banned from Clickbank which should set of immediate red flags.
There is a long winded history of scam complaints related to Anthony Morrison online.

In May of 2012, Success With Anthony Was SHUT DOWN by Clickbank…
That is correct.  This program was removed from Clickbank back in May of 2012 within Clickbank, the largest affiliate network online for information products.  This is the message that was sent out form Clickbank to affiliates:

There are several reasons this can happen and none of them are good.    Here are some of the reasons that the Success With Anthony program was tossed from Clickbank…
It had a very high refund rate
It had a very high chargeback rate
They were getting a high volume of scam complaints to their support
The product made false claims that were in violation of Clickbank policy
To anyone that is knowledgeable of Clickbank, you will know that there are a lot of low quality info products on their network so to get banned would truly require a low grade product or perhaps even doing something wrong.  Unfortunately Success With Anthony falls into this category and they have since had to move onto a different merchant account to hand the sale of their products.
 
What’s Included in SWA Package?
The program promises to be easy to follow and understand for everyone and there is a lot of training material included, however, much of that information is not beginner level. For instance, module 3 focuses on making profits with SEO marketing in some very obscure ways, not an easy concept for anyone to understand, let alone a beginner.
In truth, Success with Anthony is best utilized by those with at least a rudimentary understanding of the terms and concepts that are used in the program or those who want to put in the extra effort to educate themselves.
The basics of the training here comes in the form of three modules. Those modules are broken down into PDFs and videos. Weekly trainings are used to round out the program. The three modules are:

Module 1: Email marketing profits.  Features an over 200 page eBook plus 14 videos.


Module 2: Social Media Marketing Profits:  Comes broken down into four parts for each of the major social media types, (Facebook, Twitter, Google + and YouTube) Again, this module comes in four eBooks and videos.


Module 3: SEO profits.

In addition to these modules, additional training and programs are included. Some of these “additional” offers are only available through the various affiliates, however.  There is some good training and advice within these products.
 
Are You Going to Get Help From the Anthony Morrison Team?
Support with Success With Anthony is less than top notch. There is no mention of a community or forum of support among peers and all help, questions and concerns are referred to a standard support desk setup and within the product you are not going to be able to connect with Anthony himself.  It is one of those programs where you buy and you are left to “figure it out on your own”.  If you can learn in this environment and you like mediocre content, this product might be fore you, but otherwise there are much better and more support options out there.  Reference my top 3 products for a better understanding, they will all offer you some great potential.
The Price – $7…$147…$1,000’s
One of the most annoying aspects of the Success with Anthony programs comes in the form of pricing. The first price that you see will probably not be the price that you are going to eventually pay. In fact, the more that you try to click away, the more they will lower the price to make you stay. In one instance, the price went from $19 to $7 but “only for me” and “only for a limited time”. While trying to click away, you will also be told about an offer to give you $48 right out of Anthony’s pocket. You will later learn about the guarantee which will give you your money back at the end of a full year plus $100 if you are not satisfied.
If this seems dodgy, because it is and the “buying” is just starting there.  If you invest in the initial product, you can expect an instant OTO (One Time Offer) of $147…and then you will be a form appearing requiring your address, phone number and email and it asks you why you want to be on Anthony’s team.  If you don’t know what this means, let me quickly explain for you.
When a company within the “make money” world asks for your phone number, it means one thing.  They are going to solicit more offers to you and try to get more money from you.   Then you will get hit up by “mentoring” companies who then phone you and try to offer you expensive $1,000 – $5,000 coaching.  Talk about Expensive.
So this product starts with a low ticket offer…and ends up with you giving up your personal details in efforts to get you to spend $1,000’s.  Typical stuff that gurus are doing in an industry.
 
My Final Thoughts on Success With Anthony
For it’s few good points, (a decent amount of training and information) this program has quite a few really problematic trouble spots. The fact that the pricing is so erratic is just one of the many red flags as is the false claim that you can have “up to five free websites” when that is just not the case at all.
In addition, it is not made clear up front that you have to pay for some of the traffic methods well.   Dishonesty is something that I don’t take lightly and I am not all that sure you can put much trust in the Success With Anthony program or the product owner himself.  When you are booted off affiliate networks because content is of such low grade….and you are knowingly selling people’s information for money, I would say you are running a commonplace scam or at the very least, doing something that has in some way created issues within that network.
Avoid this product at all measures and if you do invest, don’t say I didn’t warn you. 😉
Success With Anthony at a Glance…
 
Name:  Success With Anthony
Website:  www.successwithanthony.com
Price: $7, $147, then possibly $1,000’s
Owners: Anthony Morrison
Overall Rank: 36 out of 100 points.
VERDICT: Lower grade product, poor support complaints, hidden pricing practices
Do you have a personal experience that you would like to add about Anthony Morrison or this product, Success With Anthony ?  If so, I would love to hear your personal experience of the education/support you received.  Thanks as always for your feedback, it greatly helps others out! 🙂

OH I’m too ashamed to say they sucked out close to $15.000,00 from me and my partner back in 2013. I still can’t believe it, and  being a novice I haven’t been able to make anything with their programs.

I can’t believe the Morrison bros are still in biz.  I have been involved in a few of their programs in the past mind you, never again.  
They are shameless and they build their business on the vulnerable who don’t know any better.  Fortunately I woke the hell up before I spent too much money.

I have a very bad experience with Anthony Morrison’s product. I had bought all of the up grade products thinking I was going to have all that I need it to start making it online. Than only a week into setting up his product I had Income Solution calling me they convince me that I need it their product to set up Anthony’s product I was paying 2600.00 up front and have a loan with a financial company to paid 120.00 on my visa per month for a year. 
I bought into it thinking that with their help I was going to set it up fast and generated money fast so I could paid the loan and recup my investment. I am suppose to have a 6 month coaching and make it, if not they would help me until I make it.
This happen like a month ago october 2014. Than I started to be invited to Anthony webinar I went and on each of his webinar I was suppose to get some coaching but instead they make show you a way to generate money fast and at the end they tell you to buy the software for thousands of dollars. I got so angry after a few webinar that I canceled everything and got the money back on the product.
The problem is that the hosting does not want to refund me 300.00 USD and I paid with canadian dollars I’m Canadian and I can’t get the 4000.00 dollars that I give Income solution.
I take to Income solution and said that I did not want to keep Anthony’s product so they were nice enough to say that they would support and help me with any product I want to advertise. Because I can’t have my money back even if I know they have overcharged me I don’t have any other choice than making it work for me. Today I finished my 4 call coaching and they told me that any time I would just have to call and make an appointment they would talk on the phone and help. The coaching is done now by email when I am stock in what I am doing I email they are suppose to help me.
I am not very happy with this but is there a way for me to recup my 4000.00 $. It is paying lots of money for what I get. If you have a solution for me to ask for a refund with Income Solution  let me know. Other than that I am stuck with it and hope to God that they will help me in setting up optin page a generated profit on my expertise niche.
Do you have any idea on how I should deal with this?
I also like to tell you that one week after I a company call me to again fraud me saying I need their product to build the website from Anthony into a mobile site they want it 5k this time . I report to fraud and call the Canadian bureau of credit to alert them and canceled my visa. and last week and another company called me telling me I was on the list to get a grand and I had to paid 1000.00 to get the grand they had most of my info and proceed  with debiting 2,600.00 on my visa  telling me I need to have an amazon website to be eligible to the grand because I was a Canadian. I called my visa again and file a fraud complaint the company try to call me for a week I never answered. The bank is dealing with those guys. Two years ago I had bought Anthony’s product and within a week people called me wanting me to buy their product for thousands of dollars I had to go for surgeries and cancelled every  Anthony’s product. At the time I did not make the connection of those false company with Anthony because I had cancelled fast and was aways for over 8 months. If I had knew about it I would have never bought it again. I totally feel ashamed and stupid. I wish I could do something to catch those guys and girls that steal from people like us who need a solution to make money and believe on online marketing but don’t have the knowledge. I would do anything to have them paid for what they do to me and other people

This outfit fought the refund request until I had my cc open a case. It was ultimately decided in my favor because AM reps never answered the inquiry. So I got  my money back, looks like thats an unusual out come. Week later they cold call me Sat morning and went through a pitch, which I listened to until they got to the How much income, how much debt, how many ccards , what is the limit on each of them. HOLD IT  HOW MUCH IS THE LIMIT ON EACH OF THEM?  Believe me this is a SCAM. You tell me How much your ccard limits and I’ll hand  you off to my supervisor. We need this sort of info so we can better evaluate your viability to us and our program. YOU FIGURE IT OUT. If this isn’t enough to warn you away from AMorrison then you deserve what your about to do to yourself.  I’m not even gonna whis you ‘ good luck’

Hi Kyle
I do not know whether to thank you for your startlingly unambiguous review of Anthony Morrison. Or shall I curse you for ‘bursting the bubble’ I had inflated with hopes of at last establishing an online business through Anthony Morrison.
I am an objective and realistic person. Anthony, and now his brother (As if one was not enough) has joined the band wagon! As I said, although I AM  realistic person, must hand them credit of being so CONVINCING and COMPELLING in their sales material….
I only invested a modest sum of $7.00 and $47.00 but soon realized that it is just yet another scam. 
I am EXTREMELY grateful to have stumbled on your website and have been warned in time what sort of people the brothers are. I was seriously thinking of taking an expensive coaching course from them!
Unfortunately having tried nearly TEN TIMES I have yet to come across a newbie-friendly EASY to follow course or program that could lead me to my rather LOFTY financial goals. Can you help?

You should feel fortunate that you were only taken for $47, most people fall into the trap of signing up and spending money on their mentoring (which they usually offer via phone).  They try to suck you for as much as money as they can, usually a minimum of $1,000 and far upwards of that.  
I can definitely help you see the light Azeem and if you ever need a hand, I want you to check out Wealthy Affiliate.  It is completely free with no obligations and you will be able to get direct access and help from me there.

So sorry to hear this and this is always the same tone with anyone that leaves feedback here about Success With Anthony (or any of the Morrison brothers products in general).  They are in the business of taking money from others, plain and simple.  I do appreciate you offering your feedback and I know this is going to help prevent others from getting scammed by this program.

Unfortunately this is widespread in the industry and there are many scams out there like the “traps” that Anthony Morrison is setting for others.  Get people in at a low price…then work on getting them to spend much more on upsells and mentoring programs.  Very common and it is happening everywhere.  This is something that we have been fighting against for years and helping people avoid and I am sorry that you were sucked into this scheme.  
I can only hope that you can get somewhere in respect to your refund and going forward, if you want to create a PROPER business online I will be more than happy to help you out.  Head over to my Getting Started page and I will get you moving in the right direction.

Corruption is at its’ core. They used lies, sweet talk, lots of promises and I come to find out that they are not who they said they were. They tricked me into signing a loan with the company that they never mentioned before and I was not aware of. They did say one price but the papers showed double $ that loan. Supposedly this school is a mentoring school where they educate you how to make money but in reality their purpose is to put you in more and greater debt. The product that you bought, its not there. They lied. Those websites that you purchased its not even there. Beware of “incomesolutionslms.com” and “wealth information network”. They rip people off.

I went to a seminar in my hometown that promoted this supposed get rich quick crap and I fell for it. There were about 50 people there, all elderly that wrote checks out to him that day in the amount of $3000.00. I feel sorry for all of them. I purchased this stupid thing online and then lost contact with them and couldn’t find it on the web or a phone number to call and get it back.  I messaged Anthony on face book and told him the program wouldn’t accept my e-mail address or password and if I didn’t get an immediate response I was stopping payment tomorrow.  I got an e-mail from him this morning and he gave me a web address to retrieve my sign on and when I went to it, it was just another video of him trying to sell his crap.  I called my bank to report fraud on this shister. They lied to me anyway, it was NOT $195.00, it was only to be $100.00 but when I checked my bank statement it was $195.00. I also paid $47.00 for one and $49.00 for another one.I only paid $281.00 but it was $281.00 I can not afford.  I will never get taken like this again

Sorry to hear about this Janet, I am getting floods of emails and complaints about Anthony Morrison and his promotional antics (scamming) people out of their hard earned money.  They pay, they get upsold on a myriad of things (often times $1,000’s for mentoring programs) never to hear anything again.  Thanks for sharing your story, I think it will definitely wake a lot of others up to this and get them to think twice before they offer up their credit card for anything relating to Success With Anthony or Anthony Morrison programs.

So sorry to hear about this Bonna, you are definitely not alone.  Anthony Morrison is becoming famous not for the quality of his actual products, but taking money form the vulnerable and lining his pockets.  Quite shameful and if you can, you should contact your credit card company and see what they can do for you.  Also, if you are located in the US, I know many folks are filing FTC complaints against the practices implemented by Anthony Morrison and co.

I also did Success with Anthony because I was referred to it by panda research. I found myself spending more and more money. More money than I could ever pay back. So much that my credit card issued me a fraud alert. So, I called my credit card company. They willingly stopped payment to Anthony Morrison and cancelled my credit card after I told them that he had stolen my card info… which is what it amounts to. Once he got me, he kept trying for more, more, more, until I was hyperventilating. Needless to say, I no longer have a credit card to my name for awhile. Stinks, but it’s worth it.

Probably the best thing that could have happened to be honest Rosalee.  The typical customer with the Success With Anthony program gets solicited after the fact via phone call to buy “expensive” mentoring packages from a rep that gets paid not based on the quality of their help, but upselling you on this low grade training.  
Live and learn, but in the future stay away from programs that claim to get your rich overnight.  They are a scam 99.9% of the time.

Just found this site while doing some research on the ASM launch. Like Tommy just said about his GF, the reason I am in IM is because two years ago the Morrisons took me for $8000. Then their 3rd part mentors took more. I’m just climbing out of it now, and I will never do anything like this again before at least doing some research. 
Is filing a complaint with my credit card company the best way to try to get this money back? I would think the window on something like that is closed, but it’s worth asking about. Thanks for the info!

The problem is if you contact their support regarding refunds, they will ignore you. So the best thing you can do is contact your credit card.  Unfortunately the Anthony brothers continue to scam people out of their hard earned money and what they are doing is getting you in and a low ticket price ($30-40) and then they are using your information to solicit their high ticket coaching packages.
There is hope though Steve and I would love to personally help you turn your ventures around online.  Head over to my Getting Started With an Online Business walk-through and I will help you get rolling for free and show you the exact process of creating a business online.

Hey Tom, you are not the first to complain about the “no support”, the low quality products and the inability to take them up on their refund policy with the Anthony Morrison suite of products.  Worst case scenario you should consider contacting your credit card company and letting them know if their support lines are not responsive over there.

Thanks Kyle,
I was just about to join a company affiliated with Anthony Morrison, but just thought of checking some reviews first, I’m glad I did. We have been ripped off 3 times last year. We are needing extra income, a home business, so firstly we spent about $3,000 in an advertising business, which were paying 80% every 16 weeks on every ad pack bought… but they closed down and took the cash. # 2 promised 3% daily for 50 days, we spent $4,500 and they closed and we lost again. #3, we were told that the money was in Affiliate Marketing, so as we needed help, so we contacted Ryan Morgan of Success Mentors Inc. who promised to build an affiliate business to at least $3K a month in 90 days, we paid them $3,450. but when he got the cash, we never could contact him again. His phone service said he would return our calls, but never did! So we are now going to have a look at your business Wealthy Affiliate business.  Thanks Kyle for your clear and helpful information so far..

Hi Kyle,
In the meantime Anthony had a new product launch: Traffic with Anthony with a tool named “Auto Traffic Accelerator”.
It works mainly on Youtube and there a 2 modules:
Video Messaging and Video Ripping. The second module seems to be illegal, because its downloading videos and uploading them again to your youtube channel with your watermark on it. Could you investigate a little bit further?


Reply 


Kyle 

December 28, 2013 at 4:47 pm

The second method is illegal.  It teaches people to steal copyrighted content and present it as they “own it”.  This says a lot about Anthony and the shady techniques that he recommends to people (that actually don’t work anyways).

You and Tommy Dillard are going to get a kick out of this.  I bought into his 3 day -in-person- $3000 affiliate marketing program held by his brother Adrian Morrison.  All he did was teach you how to put ads on Facebook.  He didn’t teach about marketing to specific groups, or even making fan pages.  He said to put a border around the picture, set it to $5 a day and watch your bank account grow.  I learned 100 times the information on a product called 2 cent facebook clicks than I did with this garbage.

Wow, shocking.  This sounds a lot like what is going on everywhere.

I would file a complaint if you can Robbie and work to get your money back.  
Good luck and if you ever need a hand starting a business online I will be more than happy to help you out.

I too bought the CPV domination program from Anthony Morris. I wanted a refund but sent it to the wrong email address. Therefore they will not give back my refund because the thirty days had already passed. I paid $1000 for it. I am going to write BBB on this guy. He just take your money and get rich.

I purchased CPV domination a couple of years ago, where I can put several links in various websites. It is suppose help get massive traffic, I haven’t made a cent.
I am very frustrated. Anthony M. is constantly trying sell you products, but you don’t profit. I want to make money back and leave him alone.  A refund is due to me in a matter of days from the product massive traffic with Anthony; I was unable to download the program. I am trying to make extra income to help my elderly mother: I really want to change what I am doing.  It has over 2 year looking off and on for something I can do online from home. I don’t want to be sold a lot of products that doesn’t make me any money.  I don’t have give out like that. Do you of work from online businesses that is legitimate that is not constantly selling you products as you move further into the advertisement.

Thanks for sharing your experience Deniece, it is very similar to almost everyone that has had a run in with Success With Anthony or any of the Anthony Morrison products.  Hopefully your story will save others from wasting their money in the future.

Thank you so much for this review.   I have just had a conversation with a “Mentor” and I refused to go ahead with the training.   They wanted $999. down payment and would finance the rest of $3,600.   For what I asked – well for my education over a year.   The pressure was fierce and just made my Spidey Sense tingle.  Of course, I did not give in and then found your site. Thank you for confirming what I already suspected.

Yeah, they were high pressure because they only thing they were after was your MONEY, not your business.  That is the problem with many of these programs (Success With Anthony is not the only product that does this).   They get you in the door at a low ticket price and then get real “pushy” with their higher ticket items.  It is totally unethical in my opinion!

I can’t even find any kind of support site to try to get a refund.

If you can’t get any help with a refund or get in contact with their support, I would suggest the next best thing would be to contact your credit card company and file a complaint.

Klye,  what is a good program to use.  There has to be some successful programs that re not scams.    I still believe there is a program low cost that will help teach the right method of making money only.  Suggestion.

Sorry to hear this Melvin, you are not the first or the last.  You know to watch out for his high ticket programs that he is likely to try to sell you know that they have your email address from your initial purchase.

You would have to deal with your credit card company that you used to purchase the program.  I am sorry to hear you are having such an issue getting a refund through the Success With Anthony program.  If there is anything I can help you out with going forward Jim, please do let me know.

Kyle:
   I worked with Anthony and Adrian Morrison, and I lost money.
   Just wanted to know if this is a scam.  I think it is.  What do you think.
    Please let me know.
    That is one of the reason why I want to make some more money.
   Sincerely yours,

I think you answered your own question Pamela.  These two are notorious for ripping people off through high ticket “mentoring” programs.  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck…
If you want to move to a safe haven from scams, I do suggest you check out some of the top recommend products on my website.  I don’t want to see this happen to you again.  If you have any questions going forward, please do let me know and I will give you a hand.

Thanks so much for this great Review of a “SCAM” that left me Flat Broke! Let’s not forget to mention that it was my first experience with Marketing and left me with a Bad Scar. Thanks to Wealthy Affiliate the Scar has now been removed. You Guy’s are the best and definitely appreciated by this Single Mom whom is among many other Single Mom’s that are scammed and taken advantage of while only trying to have success in life. Thanks again Kyle 🙂

Sorry to hear about this Donna, I didn’t realize how many folks were taken by this scam and I can only imagine how many more are taken by it daily as a result of the late night informercials that Anthony Morrison does.  I am glad you found a home base at WA and I can assure you that you will not be subject to scams like this going forward!

Hello Kyle,
Unfortunately hips fell into the trap of this man, but luckily I did not go forward, I will have spent $ 15 so .. if there is one thing that bothers me are the OTO, once you become a member so many things I came back, especially the demand for having to pull out more money to get going, the course of which nothing .. after which I gave up. Thanks Kyle, your reviews are a blast, I like a lot your blog, and already my favorites mei, on like this … soon.

Thanks Anthony for sharing your experiences with the SWA.  I am thankful that you were not taken for the OTO and worse yet, ripped off $3,000 with the mentoring that is offered down the road from their outsourced “mentors”.   It is feedback like this that is honestly going to save others from subjecting themselves to Anthony Morrison and his ring of scams.

I don’t have any personal experience with Anthony M. I have seen several of his late night infomercials on t.v. in the past and just never really got a good vibe from hime and his offers. However, I recognize his M.O. from your review Kyle and unfortunately there are many others out there who operate in the same manner and I have fallen prey to their spiel in the past. 
I just wanted to say, this is an excellent review and I do appreciate your insights and am sharing this now with my friends, so none of them will have to go through what Tommy D. and myself have been through with these modern day charlatans.
Thanks for the heads up on Adrian too, Tommy D.

Absolutely Johnney, I don’t to see anyone go through what Tommy has gone through.  I have personally had conversations with many others that have been taken by Anthony Morrison upwards of $5K, so it is prevalent and it is taking place.  He uses his smaller ticket price products to feed the much larger beast.

Kyle one of the first products I bought was from Anthony Fast Cash Commissions, what a load of dross. Fairly cheap buy in and then nice price hikes to get to the second and third levels. I then was spammed 4 or 5 times weekly trying to get me to buy other products. Luckily I found WA before spending anymore money on them. Lucky escape for me! Great review it all sound so familiar with this guy.

Kyle 

May 30, 2013 at 9:52 pm

Yeah Mark, that is commonplace with all of his products and Success with Anthony is no different.  Unfortunately more and more people are subjected to this scam because of the late night TV ads that he tends to run.   Thanks for your feedback and I am glad you were able to duck out before one of the spam emails finally pushed you over the edge and into this endless price cycle.

So sorry to hear this Tommy and thanks for brining this to the forefront here.  I have heard some absolute horror stories in relation to folks getting ripped off with Success With Anthony via his mentoring packages (which is outsourced).   Thanks for the heads up on his brother as well, the readers here are definitely going to benefit from your personal experience.
Onwards and upwards Tommy, you are definitely heading in the right direction now. 🙂
