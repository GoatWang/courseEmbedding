Pacific Premier casts an eye for more California deals, preps for $10 billion

S&P Global Market Intelligence, formerly S&P Capital IQ and SNL, is the premier provider of breaking news, financial data, and expert analysis on business sectors critical to the global economy. This article originally appeared on the SNL subscriber side of S&P Global's website.










By Kiah Lau Haslett and Robert Clark, S&P Global Market Intelligence staff writers 
Pacific Premier Bancorp Inc. is searching for the deal or deals that will bring it within striking distance of $10 billion in assets or vault it over—and there are plenty of options to consider.
Executives at the Irvine, Calif.-based bank reiterated their acquisitive interests during the bank's first-quarter earnings call April 25, shortly after closing its Heritage Oaks Bancorp deal that increased its assets to approximately $6 billion.
Bigger goal, bigger net
The larger size means bigger deals; at the time Chairman, President, and CEO Steven Gardner stated a range for targets of between $500 million in assets up to $7.5 billion. The acquisitive bent has implications for the bank's geographic footprint as well as its march upward to $10 billion in assets.
In an interview, Gardner said the bank's primary focus is in Southern California. Management would consider banks in the central coast, central valley, and northern parts of the state, but those targets would need to have $1 billion in assets so that the company has scale in those markets right away. Pacific Premier is primarily interested in targets focused on business customers with large non-interest-bearing deposit bases.
While Gardner said he is interested in targets with up to $7.5 billion in assets, he is not interested in a merger of equals, mostly because he does not think they exist. Even if Pacific Premier partnered with a larger bank, it would still be the acquirer.
"We don't believe MOEs exist—they don't from an accounting standpoint and they don't, from our standpoint, work particularly well," he said. "In my mind, it's someone acquiring someone else."
Pacific Premier's newfound scale makes it "clearly agnostic" about deal size, a change that is "relatively new" for them, said FIG Partners research analyst Timothy Coffey. He said the bank is evaluating all options, including a series of small deals to march them into midsize bank territory or one large deal. Adding Heritage Oaks' geographic footprint also expanded the number of potential targets.
"A lot of people are talking, especially down in that Southern California marketplace," FIG Partners' Coffey said. "The Heritage Oaks deal really expands their footprint, so they can consider deals closer to where Heritage Oaks was based and not in their traditional footprint."

Looking at Pacific Premier’s prices
One factor that could influence the outcome of Pacific Premier's M&A ambitions is the increase in share prices following the November 2016 presidential election that has made proposed deals at a higher valuation more attractive and feasible.
Acquirers such as Pacific Premier could be more amenable to paying a richer valuation for a target, which could open more doors for potential partners. Gardner acknowledged that Pacific Premier has "one of the highest multiples in the country." But he said a disciplined acquisition approach is one reason why the currency has appreciated, and that philosophy would not change in future transactions.

Pacific Premier's acquisitive bent also could bring it ever-closer to the $10 billion asset threshold, which would subject it to stress testing and direct supervision from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Gardner said management has been preparing for "a couple of years" for the threshold and has made improvements to the company's enterprise risk management structure and Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering systems. In fact, Pacific Premier already runs "a lot" of the Dodd-Frank Act stress test with a third party.
"We're continuing to build, so that as opportunities come up like an acquisition to potentially go past $10 billion, we're fully prepared for that," he said.
Crossing $10 billion would also subject the bank to the Durbin amendment, which would reduce the bank's debit interchange income and is one reason why many banks choose to merge over the threshold. But Gardner said interchange revenue is only about $2.5 million a year, which is "fairly small" for a bank the size of Pacific Premier.
"That's reflective of the fact that we don't necessarily bank a lot of consumers," he said. "Even if we get to $10 billion and surpass it and the interchange fee income does get impacted, we think there's an opportunity for us to grow it regardless, simply because it hasn't been much of a focus for the bank anyway."

Business Wire




Mar 6, 2013 6:30 AM EST













 




























































  Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: PPBI) (“Pacific Premier” or the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire San Diego Trust Bank (OTCBB: SDBK), a San Diego, California, based state-chartered bank with $242.0 million in total assets and $187.9 million in total deposits at December 31, 2012. This transaction will expand Pacific Premier’s banking footprint into San Diego County and is expected to further improve Pacific Premier’s deposit mix.  Steven R. Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Premier commented, “This is an attractive opportunity for us to expand into the San Diego marketplace with the acquisition of San Diego Trust Bank, one of the top performing community banks in this market. We believe San Diego is a logical extension for our franchise that will allow us to continue to execute on our strategic plan. This acquisition will enable us to introduce the Pacific Premier brand, products and services into a new market with similar demographics to our current footprint. Further, the transaction will provide us with significant opportunities for synergies due to San Diego Trust Bank’s strong relationship based business banking model.”  Mr. Gardner continued, “We are excited that San Diego Trust Bank has agreed to join and grow with Pacific Premier. We see this as an exciting opportunity for our combined shareholders, customers and employees. San Diego Trust Bank’s existing customers will continue to receive the same excellent customer service and products without disruption. Additionally, the acquisition of San Diego Trust Bank will allow Pacific Premier to deploy a portion of its current capital base into a compelling investment. Lastly, we expect to be able to leverage the strong core deposit franchise of San Diego Trust Bank with our robust loan product offerings.”  “We are thrilled to announce this strategic partnership with Pacific Premier,” said Michael Perry, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Trust Bank. “Not only does this combination provide our original shareholders with the opportunity to realize a meaningful return on their initial capital investment of $12 million, it allows them the opportunity to participate in the enhanced value created by the collective efforts of our respective organizations,” he added. “Our clients will benefit from the increased lending capacity as a result of this merger and the broad array of financial services and products that Pacific Premier currently offers. Most importantly, our valued clients will continue to be served by the same exceptional team they have known and trusted for years at San Diego Trust Bank. This is truly a situation where our shareholders, clients, staff and the San Diego community benefit greatly from the combined efforts and resources of two exceptional banking institutions,” concluded Perry.
