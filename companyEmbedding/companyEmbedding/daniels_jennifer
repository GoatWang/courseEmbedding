The Lethal Dose

This is a riveting book for anyone who wants to know how safe their medical care really is. If you have been harmed or unimproved by medical therapies, you will be enlightened and relieved by the straightforward answers in this book. Dr Daniels clearly explains how Board Certified Doctors who are following the Standard of Care, killed 759,766 patients in the United States in 2011. She reveals her observation of medical harm during her years of medical education, Family Practice Residency Training and Community Medicine practice. Dr Daniels’ refusal to participate in the killing of patients was the basis of her evolving interest in Alternative Therapies. Dr Daniels’ triumph in embracing the concept of Holistic Health led her to focus on reducing drug violence as part of improving the health of the community where her medical practice was located. This is a real eye opener. Her medical practice was jeopardized when she foiled a 30 million dollar bank heist. You will have to read the book to get the rest of that story.
Dr Daniels’ 30 year journey of developing Natural Healing wisdom and know-how is a gripping read with humor adventure and revelations. Before you even think of keeping another medical appointment, read this. Dr Daniels shares her experience with immunizations, antibiotics and blood thinners to name a few. The detailed and lively examples make this a must-read. Dr Daniels even includes a guide to powerful Natural remedies that allowed her to stop using antibiotics in her medical practice once she observed how ineffective they were. A real page-turner that could save your life. Find out why your doctor is prescribing the Lethal Dose.




 
Do you have the Guts to be Beautiful?

Dr Daniels’ ground breaking revelation of the connection between beauty and diet, as well as easy natural ways to bridge the gap between what you know you should do and what you actually do.  After applying even a few suggestions in this book, your friends and family will see the difference in days.

				  'Dr. Jennifer Daniels – Turpentine: The Miracle Medicine, Candida Cleaner and Much More – November 14, 2013' have 25 comments  November 15, 2013 @ 7:02 pm David King On the RSS podcast feed which I use to get these podcasts, part 3 is missing, but at least I could get it from this web page. Reply  November 16, 2013 @ 1:50 am Howard Patrick, you may be interested in this discussion concerning varying qualities of turpentine:http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1139512But that said, it all appears to be genuine turpentine or pure gum spirits. Don’t know if these qualities would affect (therapeutic) efficacy or not ?? Reply  November 17, 2013 @ 6:03 pm Lauren Nelson Dear Dr. Daniels, I have had psoriasis for 30yrs.  I wanted to purchase your book The lethal dose but I wanted to know first if it covered healing psoriasis.  I have multiple books on treating and healing Psoriasis the natural way. I heard about you from a customer and then listened your podcast. Please let me know if Psoriasis is covered in your book.Thank you and be well. Lauren Nelson Reply  November 17, 2013 @ 8:19 pm skg Hi Lauren, You can write to Dr. Daniels through her website. Just click on her website link in the podcast page. Reply  November 18, 2013 @ 12:04 am JimBorini Lauren, i had psoriasis for five years on the back of my head, oozing at times, and itchy.  It disappeared by going on a raw food diet for a year, four years ago.  I’m not on the diet anymore but a mostly very healthy intake. Reply  November 17, 2013 @ 10:32 pm John Shore Anyone with experience of Mylands Turpentine from the UK or this one, http://www.utrechtart.com/BestTest-Pure-Gum-Turpentine-MP-01768-001-i1002182.utrechtApparently shipping turpentine from USA is classed as a hazard so can’t get the recommended stuff from “Diamond Forest products” without a LARGE hazzard fee. Reply  January 9, 2014 @ 12:26 pm Maria Hi John,Just wondering if you found a reliable source of genuine Turpentine in the UK?If not, would you be interested in sharing the cost of the hazard fee to ship to the UK? I’ve spoken to Diamond Forest and they said the fee is around $100 (GBP60.00). This will cover any amount of turpentine sent whether it’s 500ml or 5 litres..Any info/response would be greatly appreciated :-)Take care, Maria Reply  November 18, 2013 @ 9:46 am roger were do you get the pure Turpentine ?roger Reply  November 18, 2013 @ 12:11 pm skg http://www.diamondgforestproducts.com/Products.html Reply  November 18, 2013 @ 4:41 pm roger thanks got it ordered Reply  November 19, 2013 @ 12:38 am mick Thank you for that link. I was just about to go back and listen through just to find it. Reply  November 18, 2013 @ 6:30 pm Mona In hour one a pdf document was referred to, one that Dr. Daniels was provided. It was stated that it would be posted on this website – I think I heard that statement correctly. Is it posted, and I just missed it? Thanks, Mona Reply  November 19, 2013 @ 7:59 am skg It’ll be up by the end of today. Reply  November 19, 2013 @ 8:58 am Alan Dear Patrick, Poor one teaspoon of the turpentine on three cubes, or a tablespoon of sugar and eat it, or mix it with water?? Reply  November 20, 2013 @ 10:44 pm Louise Came across dr Daniels report a couple of weeks ago and ordered some gum turpentine – and then this radio show came on. Been doing the prep and went straight ahead and took a dose – just after a few minutes I can feel a lighter feeling in the liver. This is really promising and inspiring. Thank you! Reply  November 22, 2013 @ 12:34 am Holly Where is the link postedto the pdf Patrick was discussing the history of turpentine healing. Or Post the document name so I can google and read. I tried to find it but there is so much out there on this subject and wanted to read the same doc/info.  Many thanks! Reply  November 24, 2013 @ 6:34 pm John http://oneradionetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Turpentine-PDF.pdfI got some of the Mylands pure gum turpentine from Amazon UK. Is using non white sugar cubes ok? Reply  November 27, 2013 @ 4:00 pm JB Hello John – I am also in the UK, how did you get on with the Mylands? Reply  January 10, 2014 @ 8:21 am Wees I’ve read yesterday that it’s a bit less effective, but ok. Reply  December 3, 2013 @ 9:10 am Ian Anyone in the UK find a good suply yet? or have any fead back? I would like the http://www.diamondgforestproducts.com/Products.html but shipping is not going to happen!ThanksIan Reply  December 3, 2013 @ 9:38 am skg I will only say what my experience is.  Before finding Diamond G Forest Products I found a can of Pure Gum Spirits, 100% Pure Turpentine at a small hardware store in Austin, ingested it and am writing this reply and still in my body :)We like Diamond G Forest because it is a small family that simply takes the sap out of the trees, distills it down and extracts the essential oil that is commonly called turpentine.I realize Diamond G does not ship to EU, but there is always a way to experience what one wants.Patrick Reply  January 9, 2014 @ 1:02 pm Maria Hi Ian,I’m also in the UK and am having trouble finding genuine turpentine. I am trying to see if a group of people would be open to splitting the cost of the Hazard handling fee so that we can ship some turpentine from Diamond Forest Products. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in.Or perhaps you have found a satisfactory product? If you have, I would be grateful for any info..Thank you:) Maria Reply  December 4, 2013 @ 12:54 pm jdh Hi.  Does anyone know where to get the smaller sugar cubes?  All the ones I can find are half inch square.thanks!Jason Reply  December 9, 2013 @ 9:33 pm Sylvia Oh my goodness, had forgotten about turpentine and teaspoon of sugar. Gotta find some here in Boquete, Panama. And cod liver oil Just Because Reply  May 18, 2017 @ 8:53 pm Diane I am 65 years old. When I was a very young child every month my mom would give us a table spoon of Castor Oil and ever so often she would take white sugar and turpentine in a table spoon, brown it till it was almost black and give it to us. Never had any of these common sicknesses. ReplyWould you like to share your thoughts? Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
