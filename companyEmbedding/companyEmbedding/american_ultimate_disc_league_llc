Pamela Brill, June 7, 2017
 
Tucker Toys is sponsoring the American Ultimate Disc League to support its Disk Jock-e product.HAMILTON, N.J. – Tucker Toys recently entered into a sponsorship agreement with the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) to support the company’s new Disk Jock-e, a throwing disc with a built-in Bluetooth stereo speaker.
Details of the new sponsorship deal include a special Disc Jock-e AUDL Connection of the Week, in which a highlight clip of the best pass and catch series from the league games is singled out as the best sequence of the week.








Mark Nathan, CEO and president of Tucker Toys, said, "It’s a perfect match for our new Disc Jock-e. We’ve connected things people love like favorite music and a game of catch with a flying disc. Now we’ve been able to connect a fun way for fans to emulate the sport while highlighting some of the amazing AUDL athletes each week.”
