MeyerCounselOverviewExperienceNews/EventsPublicationsUp CloseDispute Resolution BioStephen Meyer has more than forty years of experience with complex business litigation with a particular focus in the last several years on food and agriculture.He advises some of California's largest agricultural producers on environmental, finance, and business disputes, and has handled matters involving dairies, cattle feeding, fertilizer and pesticide distribution and regulation, egg production, animal welfare, crop damage, food processing, and agricultural finance.  More recently he organized the Food & Agriculture Practice, an interdisciplinary group that has grown rapidly by emphasizing collaboration and cooperation across the broad spectrum of specialty practices at the firm with a focus on food and agriculture in California.He has represented clients in other areas including banking, oil and gas, pipeline distribution, real estate development, as well as representing public entities. In recent years, he has expanded his practice into alternative dispute resolution, bringing his experience as litigator and mediator, to helping parties resolve business, commercial and environmental disputes.Experience
	Food and Agricultural Litigation


		Represented a major egg producer in matters regarding Proposition 2, including litigation as well as negotiation regarding legislation and regulation at both the Federal and State level.

		Represented a major cattle feeding operation in litigation where feeding practices and accounting issues were disputed.

		Represented parties in disputes regarding milk pricing including litigation with private parties and disputes with State regulatory agencies.

		Represented large grocery chain regarding disputes with the Department of Pesticide Regulation regarding claims that certain products were subject to DPR jurisdiction because of alleged pesticidal representations.

		Represented large fertilizer manufacturer regarding false claims by competitors that their fertilizer products were organic when in fact that proved clearly not to be true.

		Outside General Counsel for the largest organic fertilizer manufacturer in the western states advising regarding State and Federal organic rules and regulations permitting, product safety issues, and business issues. In this regard expertise developed on the general laws and rules regarding organic agriculture and has testified to legislative committees on these issues.


	Environmental Litigation


		Represented as Chief Co-Liaison Counsel for 150 defendants, as well as counsel for the target defendant, in the Lodi groundwater contamination case. This was a highly complex and notorious lawsuit that involved multiple agencies, bizarre financial structures, and incentives for obstruction that almost ruined the City of Lodi financially, and, if written, about would read more like a novel. This case was successfully settled after more than five years for no more than what would have been offered at the beginning of the lawsuit.

		Represented several Clean Water Act cases involving various businesses including lumber mills, parking lots, mining operations, and waste treatment plants, all of which were favorably resolved.

		Represented on a RCRA/CERCLA/nuisance case with the owner of a landfill in Imperial County where alleged hazardous waste was hauled from the client's geothermal power plant, which was settled on favorable terms involving minimal financial contribution.


	Business Litigation


		Represented a number of financial institutions, principally community banks over a 30 year period in wide range of lawsuits, which included lender liability claims, RICO actions, class actions, as well as work out negotiations by and between the Banks and their commercial/business customers. A number of these matters involved multiple institutions and complex financing arrangements involving large financial commitments and major projects. On all of these matters I have been the Lead Counsel and they have been resolved by trial, court order, or settlement on terms the clients viewed as favorable.

		Outside General Counsel for several years for a large Sacramento community bank (which eventually was sold to a large national bank), advising the Board, advising on regulatory matters, and conducting the Bank's litigation.  And Stephen Meyer has also represented several other community banks on a variety of matters including litigation

		Represented several businesses including accounting firms in business and partnership dissolution and disputes by and between members/ partners/shareholders, all of which were favorably resolved by Order or settlement.

		Represented landowners in various disputes involving their real property, including partition claims, trespass claims and nuisance claims. Recently successfully represented through trial verdict large landowner facing adverse possession claims for significant acreage bordering a private golf course.

Publication number:  20170028238
                                            

Abstract:  A thermal trigger assembly for remote mechanical actuation of another fire protection system component includes an activation component having a base and a movable member. A bias member biases the movable member from a preactivation to an activated position with respect to the base. A thermally responsive element retains the movable member in the preactivation position until a predetermined thermodynamic condition is reached, when the thermally responsive element loses structural integrity. A flexible connector includes a flexible hollow outer cable housing with one end configured to be stationarily (preferably fixedly) connected with the base. A flexible cable is inside the outer cable housing for sliding movement therein and has one end configured to be stationarily (preferably fixedly) connected with the movable member. The flexible cable is moved with respect to the outer cable housing by movement of the movable member upon loss of structural integrity by the thermally responsive element.

Patent number:  6502643
                                            

Abstract:  A low pressure, early suppression fast response sprinkler includes a generally tubular body having an inlet end, an opposing discharge end and an internal passageway extending between the inlet and discharge ends with a K factor greater than 16 where the K factor equals the flow of water in gallons per minute through the internal passageway divided by the square root of the pressure of water fed into the tubular body in pounds per square inch gauge. A deflector is coupled with the tubular body and spaced from and generally aligned with the discharge end of the internal passageway so as to be impacted by a flow of water issuing in a column from the discharge end upon activation of the sprinkler. The deflector is configured and positioned to deflect the flow of water generally radially outwardly all around the sprinkler.

Fluid conduit systems and methods for making



Patent number:  6000436
                                            

Abstract:  Multilayer fluid conduits are formed by adhering to a tubular outer surface of a metal pipe, a thermoplastic outer layer. The outer layer permits ends of the multilayer conduit to be joined together in leak-proof fluid conduit systems simply by adhering the conduit ends with compatible thermoplastic fittings. For fire protection systems, the preferred metal is steel, the preferred thermoplastic is CPVC and the preferred adhesive is heat activated. The adhesive coated metal pipe is preheated and the CPVC is extruded onto the outer surface of the heated metal pipe. Through the use of fire resistive CPVC, the multilayer conduit systems of the present invention can be installed in more severe fire threat areas than can existing, all plastic piping, including all CPVC piping systems. The conduit is assembled into systems on site simply by cutting and direct bonding with ordinary, all plastic fittings using appropriate bonding agents such as solvent based adhesives.

Directional sprinklers



Patent number:  5669449
                                            

Abstract:  Directional sprinklers include a sprinkler body with a water directing structure configured to direct water passing from an outlet of the sprinkler body in one or more distinct and different directions. Water directing structures are disclosed in the form of deflectors having one or two separate water directing channels and hollow heads having at least two separate nozzles facing in two distinct and different directions. The channels and nozzles can be configured to direct water in diametrically opposing directions, mutually perpendicular directions or at any other desired orientation with respect to one another and to direct the water radially outwardly from the centerline of the sprinkler body outlet or at any predetermined transverse angle to that centerline. The throw of each channel and nozzle is longer than it is wide so that water is discharged over a generally rectangular or elliptical area in each direction.

Extended coverage ceiling sprinklers and systems



Patent number:  5664630
                                            

Abstract:  Ceiling sprinklers and sprinkler systems provide extended areas of ordinary and light hazard coverage through a combination of orifices with K factors greater than 9 and deflectors which extend water distributions radially with acceptable uniform average and absolute distribution densities all around and beneath the sprinklers. Described deflectors for concealed sprinklers are circular with slots extending axially and radially through inwardly towards the center of the deflector from the circular perimeter. Such deflectors include a central curved protrusion extending back towards the outlet to spread the water column over the deflecting structure and a surrounding planar annular area of the structure. The deflectors are supported on pins to telescope away from the sprinkler body and drop below or farther below the lower surface of the ceiling in which they are installed.

Patent number:  5609211
                                            

Abstract:  An extended coverage ceiling sprinkler includes a generally tubular body having an inlet open end and an opposing, outlet open end with a minimal internal diameter greater than 0.65 inches and a K-factor of between about 14 and about 15. A plug at least essentially closes the outlet open end and an element releasably retains the plug in the outlet end. A deflector support extends away from the outlet end of the tubular body and a deflector is coupled to the tubular body through the deflector support. The deflector has a major surface facing, spaced from and aligned with the outlet open end with a circular outer perimeter less than 1.7 inches in outer diameter and a central area without water passing openings therethrough at least 0.75 inches in diameter. Slots extend generally radially inwardly from the perimeter and surround the central area which is slotless. The ratio of deflector outer diameter to slot depth is greater than 10 and up to about 14.
