Provides custody and cash management services for our clients through UMB Bank, n.a.

Located in the heart of America, our Kansas City location provides custody and cash management services for our clients through UMB Bank, n.a. Our parent company, UMB Financial Corporation, also headquartered here, is a diversified financial holding company offering complete banking services, payment solutions, asset servicing, private wealth management and institutional investment management to customers.

Our offices are located in downtown Kansas City, which has been selected as one of America's best downtowns by Forbes magazine. A major downtown renaissance featuring new condominiums, shopping and entertainment areas, and public spaces makes Kansas City an extremely livable metropolitan area.

Kansas City offers a wealth of attractions, including beautiful parks, outstanding architecture, world-class museums and a vibrant arts scene. The city has several unique claims to fame – over 200 fountains (second only to Rome), an abundance of boulevards (second only to Paris) and, of course, jazz and Kansas City-style barbecue.

Professional sports teams include football’s Chiefs, baseball’s Royals and soccer’s Sporting Kansas City. In fact, Kansas City has been called the Soccer Capital of America, recognizing its enthusiasm for both youth leagues and the professional team.

Kansas City, close to the geographic and population center of the U.S., offers plenty to enjoy for residents and visitors alike. Explore VisitKC to learn more.
