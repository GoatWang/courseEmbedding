Business Strategy











In the past, FieldPoint’s business strategy centered on expanding its reserve base while increasing production and cash flow through the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties. The ideal acquisition included not only oil and gas production, but also leasehold and other working interests in exploration areas.
More recently, we have chosen to focus on promising areas for oil and gas exploration, such as the Lusk Field in Lea County, New Mexico, and our Ranger Project in the Taylor Serbin Field near Giddings, Texas. In projects such as these, FieldPoint partners with companies that compliment internal expertise in evaluating opportunities and in making investment decisions. Going forward, we expect to continue to largely rely on experienced drilling and operating partners for these projects, such as we have done with Cimarex in the Lusk Field and Riley Exploration in the Ranger Project.
We recognize the ability to implement our business strategy will depend in part on our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund future acquisition, exploration, and development activities. We feel that the company is well positioned to do so, should the need arise.

Operations











FieldPoint owns a working interest in 480 gross wells, of which we currently operate 19. Non-operated wells are operated by independent contractors under standard industry contracts. With non-operated wells, we have a long history with experienced and efficient operators, such as Halcón, Apache, Cimarex, Denbury, Quantum and Linn, to name a few.
With operated wells, our portfolio includes mainly low-touch, “pumper and electricity-only” wells in the Devonian, Ellenberger and Morrow areas of West Texas and New Mexico. Higher maintenance fields are closer to home, such as the Taylor Serbin field near Giddings, Texas.
As operator, we maintain more responsibility and authority; we believe this puts us in a better position to control cost, safety, and work timelines, as well as other critical factors affecting well economics. As such, our current growth plan includes acquiring additional properties where we act as operator. However, we will still continue to consider opportunities under the management of competent operators, particularly those with which we have a record of good performance.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    3.65      Net Money Flow ($)  1,228    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FieldPoint Petroleum Corporation
EXHIBIT 14.1
(Under Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002)
This Code of Ethics is designed to promote honest and ethical conduct, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure of financial information in the periodic reports of FieldPoint Petroleum Corporation (the “Company”), and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
APPLICABILITY OF THE CODE
This Code of Ethics (the “Code”) applies to the Company’s directors and executive officers, including its chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, controller, and such other finance, accounting, tax or internal audit personnel as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer may from time to time designate. The persons listed in the preceding paragraph are referred to as the “Covered Persons.”
HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT
In performing his or her duties, each of the Covered Persons will act in accordance with high standards of honest and ethical conduct including taking appropriate actions to permit and facilitate the ethical handling and resolution of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.
In addition, each of the Covered Persons will promote high standards of honest and ethical conduct among employees who have responsibilities in the areas of accounting, audit, tax, and financial reporting and other employees throughout the Company.
FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY, AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE
In performing his or her duties, each of the Covered Persons will endeavor to promote, and will take appropriate action within his or her areas of responsibility to cause the Company to provide, full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications.
In performing his or her duties, each of the Covered Persons will, within his or her areas of responsibility, engage in, and seek to promote, full, fair and accurate disclosure of financial and other information to, and open and honest discussions with, the Company’s outside auditors.
COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS
In performing his or her duties, each of the Covered Persons will endeavor to comply, and take appropriate action within his or her areas of responsibility to cause the Company to comply, with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations and applicable rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations.
Each of the Covered Persons will promptly provide the Company’s general counsel or the Company’s audit committee with information concerning conduct the Covered Person reasonably believes to constitute a material violation by the Company, or its directors or officers, of the securities laws, rules or regulations or other laws, rules, or regulations applicable to the Company.
REPORTING VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE
Each of the Covered Persons will promptly report any violation of this Code to the Company’s general counsel or to the Company’s audit committee, as applicable.
WAIVER AND AMENDMENT OF THE CODE
The Company’s audit committee, as well as the Company’s board of directors, will have the authority to approve a waiver from any provision of this Code. The Company will publicly disclose information concerning any waiver or an implicit waiver of this Code as required by applicable law. A waiver means the approval of a material departure from a provision of this Code. The Company will publicly disclose any substantive amendment of this Code as required by applicable law.
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE CODE
The Company’s audit committee will assess compliance with this Code, report violations of this Code to the Board of Directors, and, based upon the relevant facts and circumstances, recommend to the Board appropriate action. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action including termination of employment.
