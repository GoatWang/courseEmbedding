Welcome Investors
Terra’s Secured Income Fund 5, comprised of a series of private placements, is closed to new investors. The fund makes loans secured by commercial real estate and pays interest received from those loans to investors. It was created to provide investors with income, specifically the high interest rates that became available when traditional lenders scaled back their commercial lending.

          Current securities regulations do not permit us to provide you the information available here unless you are an existing investor. If you have an investment in our funds, you will need the Investor ID and Password provided in your welcome letter to access this information. If you need to recover your Investor ID or Password, please contact your Financial Advisor or Terra.

Cookies Policy
            

This Cookies Policy (“Cookies Policy”) explains how cookies are used on this website.  We may amend this policy from time to time.  When we do, we will let you know by appropriate means such as by posting the revised policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.  By using this site you agree to the placement of cookies on your computer in accordance with the terms of this policy.  If you do not wish to accept cookies from this site please either disable cookies or refrain from using this site.  As used throughout this Cookies Policy, the terms “we”, “us”, or “our” refers to Terra Capital Partners and its affiliates.
What are Cookies?

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can recognize you when you revisit and remember certain information about you.  This can include which pages you have visited, choices you have made from menus, any specific information you have entered into forms and the time and date of your visit.
Types of Cookies

There are two main types of cookies:
Session cookies: these are temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session; that is, when you leave the site. Session cookies allow the website to recognize you as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website most efficiently.  For example, session cookies enable a website to remember that a user has placed items in an online shopping basket.
Persistent cookies: in contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are stored on your equipment between browsing sessions until expiry or deletion.  They therefore enable the website to “recognize” you on your return, remember your preferences, and tailor services to you.
In addition to session cookies and persistent cookies, there may be other cookies which are set by the website which you have chosen to visit, such as this website, in order to provide us or third parties with information.
Our use of Cookies

We currently use, and may use in the future, the following types of cookies on this website.
We use session cookies to:



help us maintain security and verify your details while you use the website as you navigate from page to page, which enables you to avoid having to re-enter your details each time you enter a new page.
We use persistent cookies to:



help us recognize you as a unique user when you return to our website so that you do not have to input your details multiple times as you move between our pages or services.


remember how you have customized your use of this site, such as your preferred currency and time zone.


collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use the website and help us improve the structure of our website.


In addition to administrative uses, we may also use cookies in one or more of the following ways, depending on the website you are using:



To conduct research and analytics to improve our website and our products and services.  This includes compiling statistical information concerning, among other things, the frequency of your use of our websites, the pages visited and the length of each visit.


To display our advertisements when you visit websites of third parties with whom we have marketing relationships and to help us gauge the effectiveness of our advertising efforts.  These parties may gather information concerning your use of other websites and provide us with de-identified information about you (such as demographic information or the names of sites where you have been shown ads) which we may use to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising.

Where this site allows such cookies to be set or you access other websites from this site using the links provided, the operators of these websites will use cookies in accordance with their own cookies policy, which may differ from ours.
Refusing Cookies on this Site

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  However, you have the ability to disable cookies if you wish, generally through changing your internet software browsing settings.  It may also be possible to configure your browser settings to enable acceptance of specific cookies or to notify you each time a new cookie is about to be stored on your computer enabling you to decide whether to accept or reject the cookie.  To manage your use of cookies there are various resources available to you, for example the “Help” section on your browser may assist you.  As our cookies allow you to access some of our website’s features we recommend that you leave cookies enabled.  Otherwise, if cookies are disabled, it may mean that you experience reduced functionality or will be prevented from using this site altogether.
