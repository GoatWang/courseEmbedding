Product Details

Product Details
This climber has yet to receive the attention it deserves. It bears semidouble, deep pink flowers in abundance in late June, with recurrent bloom well into fall. It is also exceptionally vigorous and hardy, the only recurrent climber available to gardeners in Zones 3 and 4. Destined to become one of the most enduring Roses of our era. Own-root.
Tip: We use Organic Gem® as a foliar feed on Rose bushes in our trial garden and find plants are healthier and perform better throughout the season.

HOW PLANTS ARE SHIPPEDThe size of the plants we ship has been selected to reduce the shock of transplanting. For some, this means a large, bareroot crown. Others cannot travel bareroot or transplant best if grown in containers. We ship these perennials and annuals in 1 pint pots, except as noted. We must point out that many perennials will not bloom the first year after planting, but will the following year, amply rewarding your patience. We ship bulbs as dormant, bare bulbs, sometimes with some wood shavings or moss. Shrubs, Roses, vines, and other woody plants may be shipped bareroot or in pots. The size of the pot is noted in the quick facts for each item.WHEN WE SHIPWe ship our bulbs and plants at the right time for planting in your area, except as noted, with orders dispatched on a first-come, first-served basis by climate zone.

Best kept secret of roses   


stuck in the city
from syracuse, ny 


I have my William Baffin rose planted in a location that most people would assume a rose would not do well and it thrives. It receives morning sun, partial shade the rest of the day. In over fives years it has never failed to bloom magnificently, suffered winter die-back, had black spot or any disease issues. It requires little care, I mulch with compost and cut it back in late winter, it is not at all fussy).The only drawback to this rose is that it produces a few suckers a year and is really huge, easily 9 ft tall and 8 wide after 5 years, I don't see my neighbor's ugly garage all summer.

A tried and true stalwart   


Kitty
from Littleton, MA 


I love my Willliam Baffin roses. I have them about 3 feet away from the road, and they get splashed all winter with snow, ice, and road salt. Yet come spring, they always push up new canes and bloom like crazy on both new and old wood. They are a little bit coarse for a mixed herbaceous border, but as a tall screen ( they reach 9 feet in my zone 5b garden), they are unbeatable. They can be pruned or not, as you need. Be careful when you prune for the very numerous and sharp thorns. The first flush of blooms is just magnificent - they are smothered with beautiful bright pink blooms. After that, they produce intermittent blooms for the rest of the summer. The bushes are vase-shaped and attractive even when they are not covered with flowers. For a carefree screen, they can't be beat.

Best climbing rose ever   


Chloe S
from Albany, NY 


I bought my William Baffin rose from WFF about 8 years ago, and loved it.  I had it by the gate of our white fence, where it did not get full sun all day, but still thrived, and was a prolific bloomer.  The flowers keep on coming.   Unfortunately, I had to move it while it was in full bloom for the fence and gate to be replaced.  I cut it way back but don' t know if it will come back - we'll see.  Since I can't live without it, I'll wait until these are back in stock to get a new one.  I have had to prune to keep the gate entrance clear, but generally it keeps its shape with VERY minimal pruning. I  have another climbing rose in another spot in the yard that is a nightmare to keep in shape, but William Baffin is very well behaved!   No cons at all to this hardy climber.

Tough to the tips   


Bud not dud
from S. Dakota 


We have commercial building with a parkinglot that was a heavily traveled shortcut.  A stand of these 10 feet apart spacing cut foot traffic to absolute zero.  We use them as bushes and they are approximately 10 feet wide and tall.  Very dense.  Very heavy spring flush then sporatic flowers after until hard frost.  They are hardy to the tip in -30F winters and I have never needed to prune. I was so impressed used at home to hide fence but neighbors lawn chemicals killed them after 3-4 years.

Growing guide

Growing guide

Planting: Before planting a bareroot Rose, remove and discard the packing material and soak the roots for a few hours. Then dig a planting hole that allows sufficient room for the depth and spread of the roots. (If you’re planting a Climbing Rose, locate the hole so that the base of the Rose will be about 1′ from the foot of the trellis.) Discard 1/3 of the soil dug from the hole and replace it with at least as much organic matter—such as compost, aged manure, or leafmold—and mix this into the remaining soil. Next, set the plant in the hole so that the bud union (the bulge where the top was grafted onto the rootstock) or the point where the first branch leaves the main stem (on Roses that were not grafted) is 3″ below the surrounding soil in the North, and at the same level or an inch above the soil in mild-winter climates. Then push the mix of soil and organic matter back into the hole, tamping firmly as you go. Water thoroughly. Mound soil around the canes to a height of 12–15″. This prevents the canes from drying out in the sun and wind. Check the canes every couple of days, and remove the mounded soil gradually once new growth appears.
Light/Watering: Roses grow best where they receive at least six hours of direct sun per day; more sun means more blooms and prevents leaning, leggy plants. Newly planted Roses need the equivalent of one inch of water per week throughout their first growing season. If water doesn't fall from the sky, you must supply it. A generous layer of organic mulch (compost or composted manure is best) helps keep the soil evenly moist. If weather is dry in the fall, be sure to water Roses well. Never allow the foliage to remain wet into the evening; water early in the day.
Fertilizer/Soil and pH:
Roses, with the exception of Species Roses, grow more vigorously, bloom more prolifically, and show greater resistance to diseases if fertilized several times during the growing season: in early spring (except the first spring after planting), immediately after the first wave of bloom, and again in early August. Species Roses should be fertilized just once in early spring with granular fertilizer such as 10-10-10. Gardeners in the South and West may wish to fertilize monthly from early spring until June, pausing during the heat of summer, and fertilizing again in August and September to close out the season. We prefer natural fertilizers such as fish emulsion or seaweed extract, applied in solution, because they release their nutrients more slowly and evenly than chemical fertilizers. Roses adore composted horse manure, but so do weeds. If you're willing to face the consequences by all means provide this treat as topdressing in spring or as winter mulch, and the Roses will reward you for your efforts.
Pests/Diseases: The Roses we offer were selected for their vigor and their resistance to pests and diseases. If planted and grown as we suggest, they will be healthy and healthy plants are much less troubled than plants under stress. Even if a healthy plant does suffer at the hands of a pest or disease, it will likely endure and recover without intervention on the part of the gardener. Some Roses are prone to fungus problems (such as black spot) in hot, humid areas. Cleaning up old foliage and cutting back affected canes is important for disease control. Spraying the leaves with Bordeaux mixture, a copper-based fungicide, can help once symptoms appear (follow the manufacturer's instructions) and a single application of lime sulfur applied in early spring while plants are still dormant will go far to prevent problems. Japanese beetles and Rose chafers may be handpicked or a systemic pesticide may be used. In spring, check for Rose slugs (sawfly larvae that appear as tiny, green caterpillars and skeletonize Rose foliage) and physically destroy them or spray with superfine horticultural oil.
Companions: Roses bloom at the same time as Peonies, Clematis, Delphinium, and Lilies and are ideal with many other perennials. Train non-climbing Clematis through larger shrub Roses and grow viticella and texensis Clematis varieties with the climbers.
Pruning: Prune Roses to remove deadwood, to control or direct growth, and to promote flowering. Wait until growth breaks from the canes in early spring before pruning. Deadwood can be removed at any time. Other pruning should be done in early spring on climbers, rugosas, English, and modern Roses. At that time, remove any weak or crossing branches. Remove a few of the old canes at the base of established climbers to stimulate new growth. If the Rose bush has become too tall, the stems may be cut back by one-third to one-half, pruning to an outward facing bud to direct growth away from the interior of the plant. If you grow once-blooming old-fashioned Roses, do not prune until after flowering is finished. With the exception of the rugosas, which produce attractive hips (fruits), remove the spent flowers of reblooming Roses to promote more bloom, cutting the stems back to the first large bud at the base of a set of five leaflets. Please note: 'New Dawn' reblooms best if stems are cut back to the second set of five leaflets. Grafted Roses will occasionally send up shoots from the rootstock, which should be removed as soon as noticed.
Reflowering: Many varieties of Roses available today will bloom continuously or more sporadically through the growing season. Always remove spent blooms, and cut the stems back to right above the first leaf with five leaflets. Please note: 'New Dawn' reblooms best if stems are cut back to the second set of five leaflets.
Transplanting: Roses may be moved in early spring when dormant, especially if they are young plants. Large, established Roses are more of a challenge.
End-of-Season Care: Much has been written about techniques for overwintering Roses in cold climates. In our experience, the best way to get Roses through winter is to choose plants adapted to your climate zone. That said, if you live near a Rose's cold limit and you garden on an exposed site or in an area where rapid temperature fluctuations are common, you should mound two shovelfuls of composted manure, garden soil, compost, or shredded leaves over the base of the plant in late fall after the ground freezes. Covering these mounds and the lower parts of the bushes with evergreen boughs will add protection. Pull the mounding material away from the stem as new growth emerges in spring. Do not prune Roses back in fall; wait until you see growth start along the canes in spring to prune branches injured over winter.
Calendar of Care
Early spring: Plant bareroot Roses now and transplant young Roses if needed. Check soil pH and add lime if pH is below 6.5. When new growth appears along the canes, prune established Roses to shape the bushes, remove dead or damaged tissue and open up the interior to allow for good air circulation. Remove a few of the old canes at the base of established climbers to stimulate new growth. If fungal disease is prevalent in your area, spray while dormant with Bordeaux mix, lime sulfur, or horticultural oil. Fertilize now. Gardeners in the South and West may wish to fertilize monthly from early spring until June, resuming in August and September.
Mid-Spring: Watch for Rose slugs and either handpick, spray with a superfine horticultural oil, or use a systemic insecticide. Fertilize Roses again after the first flush of flowers. Watch for shoots coming from the rootstock below the graft and remove. After the soil warms, apply a generous layer of organic mulch.
Late spring: Monitor plantings for Japanese beetles and Rose chafers and treat as needed. Watch for black spot, powdery mildew, or other foliar problems and treat with fungicides or Neem products. Water early in the day so that foliage dries off before evening sets in.
Summer: Clean up any fallen foliage and be diligent with deadheading. Continue watering if rainfall is sparse and keep Rose beds weed-free. Some varieties of Roses may need support, especially if summer thunderstorms occur in your area. As climbers send out new canes, tie them to the trellis or fence.
Fall: If you live in a cold climate and grow Roses that are not completely hardy in your area, you may wish to protect them for the winter by mounding soil or compost around the base of the plants after the ground freezes, and then adding evergreen boughs. Climbing Roses may be detached from their supports, laid down on the ground and covered with soil to get them through the winter. This procedure is viable only on the smaller climbers, but does work well with shorter Roses grown on pillars.

English Roses: "flowers are densely filled with petals, much like antique roses, and most possess a strong fragrance that harkens back to old-fashioned tea roses. Yet their growth habits, health, and, most of all, their tendency to repeat bloom, are an improvement on their ancestors. English roses are a good choice for cutting gardens. Their full, intensely perfumed flowers make sumptuous bouquets. Some varieties climb if left unpruned and can be trained along a fence or arbor." www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/rose/english-rose/

Climbing Roses: "limbing varieties develop long canes well adapted to training on pillars, fences, arbors, and gazebos. Most climbing roses are mutations or variations of bush-type varieties. They develop either large, single flowers or clustered blooms on a stem. Climbers may bloom once a season or continually, depending on the variety." www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/rose/climbing-rose/

Hybrid Tea Roses: "most roses at florist shops are hybrid tea varieties. The form of a hybrid tea rose is tall and upright, with sparse foliage toward the base. The blooms develop singly on long stems, and the buds are often as elegant as the open blooms." www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/rose/hybrid-tea-rose

Floribunda Roses: "offer a bouquet on every branch. The small flowers look like elegant hybrid tea blooms but appear in clusters instead of one flower per stem. Floribundas are a cross between polyantha species roses and hybrid teas, combining hardiness, free flowering, and showy, usually fragrant blooms." www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/rose/floribunda-rose/

One of the Hardiest Climbing Roses
William Baffin is a hardy, climbing rose.  Plant one of these brilliant beauties on the arbor in your garden, the trellis by your front door or perhaps train one into a decorative shrub for your front lawn.  No matter where you use it, William Baffin is a reliable source of color for your yard.
Your William Baffin will explode with hot-pink brilliance in June.  The semi-double blooms burst forth on the scene in huge clusters (of up to 30 blossoms each), that blanket the vine with unprecedented color and form. 
The flowers continue to bloom, over-and-over again right into fall, so you’re assured of a long season of exceptional color.  Your William Baffin not only excels in appearance but also in fragrance, emitting a soft, gentle scent that calls you in for a closer look. 
William Baffin will grow up to 10 feet.  It’s fast growing, vigorous and disease resistant.  The canes are quite strong, so can be left to their natural climbing nature, or pruned to create a colorful shrub.  William Baffin is cold hardy as well.
Some people would say that William Baffin is arguably the hardiest repeat blooming climber available (especially for northern gardeners), and that certainly seems to be the case. 
It can be difficult to find a climbing rose that will perform consistently, with strong color and form, and also provide hardiness and ease of care.  William Baffin is certainly a rose that fulfills those requirements, and is ready to provide your home with those same attributes this year.
* Spring to fall roses * Fragrant * Fast growing * Good disease resistance * Cold tolerant * Great cut flowers

Roses have had a prominent place in plant history from ancient times to the present. Rose petals from fossils millions of years old have been found. Rose bushes were grown extensively during Roman times and cultivated in China and France in the 18th century and before. The rose flower is the one constant that has propelled the rose bush to one of the most popular plants in the world. The colors, shapes and fragrance of rose flowers are simply stunning.Today’s rose bushes have maintained many of the characteristics of the ancient rose. Modern plant breeding practices have added a great deal of disease tolerance and winter hardiness to the ancient rose. Hybridization has created some wonderful colors and bush sizes that seem to be able to find a ‘fit’ in most any garden or landscape. Roses are shrubs that are cultivated in small sizes such as ‘shrub roses’ or grown as ‘climbing roses’ that may stretch out vine like branches 15 feet long. Our rose bush offerings include many sizes and colors of rose varieties. Our roses exhibit very good tolerance to rose diseases and are known for being very winter hardy. Choose from a kaleidoscope of wonderful flower colors with our rose bush selection below.

Climbing Roses are unique plants that score very high on the visibility table. They are usually grown in obvious locations such as an arbor, pillar, trellis, fence, or house wall. Their height and showy foliage display the flowers from various angles. The climbing rose can be used in a vertical garden and they do not take up much room. Climbing roses have been a part of the Rosa genus for as long as roses have been grown. All classes of roses have climbing forms. These climbers have canes that grow much longer and more flexible than other bush roses. Some of the modern climbing roses are the results of mutations.
Climbing roses usually grow from 8 to 20 feet tall and they may have a heavy early bloom and then sporadic blooms the rest of the year or they may bloom all summer long, depending on the cultivar. Climbing roses do not have the ability to cling to trellis or support by themselves. They need to be tied and trained to grow on their supports. There are many climbing roses on the market and they are available in white, red, lavender, pink, and variegated colors. Nature Hills offers several varieties of climbing roses and they are displayed below.

W. Rose™ Tools







William Rose established the W. Rose™ in 1798 as a blacksmith shop near Philadelphia. The early years were spent making cavalry sabers and officer swords for the U.S. army during the War of 1812 and the Civil War. In 1864 the focus moved from swords to edged tools, knives, and the signature brick trowel we know today. W. Rose brick trowels are still manufactured near Philadelphia. The trowels that helped build America are still made in the USA.

For over 200 years W. Rose™ has been the choice of the world's best bricklayers. Choose from four handle options (wood, plastic, leather, or ProForm® soft grip) for each of these three styles of trowels: Philadelphia Pattern trowels, Narrow London Pattern Trowels, Wide London Pattern Trowels. W. Rose™ also manufactures  a variety of specialty trowels including margin and pointing trowels, sled runners, jointers, slickers, premium Bonded Braided Nylon Mason's Line, brick hammers, and line pins. All products are made in the USA as they have been since 1798.
