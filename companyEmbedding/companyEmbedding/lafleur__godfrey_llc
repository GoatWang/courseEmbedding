Investment Management
A clear path to your future

 


Investment Management
Our Investment Philosophy
Co-Founder Jim LaFleur said it best: “Our investment philosophy was simple and still holds true today – identify quality companies with good growth prospects that are run by ethical and competent managers.  Buy them at a reasonable price and, importantly, be patient.”
We do not believe that one size fits all.  At LaFleur & Godfrey, there are no market strategists, model portfolios or style boxes to plug our clients’ assets into.  Our portfolio managers have discretion to personally select securities for your investment portfolio based on your individual goals and needs.  The flexibility in our investment process has been paramount to our long-term success. It enables our investment team to adapt quickly to changing economic and market environments for the benefit of our clients.   Our flexibility and customization are what makes us different.  We put you first, always.
 

Equity Selection Process

Fixed Income Process
At LaFleur & Godfrey, we believe in a balanced approach to investment management. While individual stocks are owned for their long-term growth prospects, our fixed income securities, comprised of individual bonds and/or bond ETFs, are held in client portfolios to preserve principle, generate adequate income and fund client withdrawal needs. With this in mind, our team’s fixed income investment approach focuses on ownership of high-quality, investment-grade securities and portfolio risk management.
Fixed Income Management & Portfolio Characteristics:

Segment the portfolio into bucks of short, intermediate and longer-term holdings.
Structure the portfolio with the client’s income needs in mind.
Emphasize overall portfolio quality – investment grade (Baa/BBB) or higher.
Ladder maturities with the average maturity of the portfolio generally in the 3-6 year range.
Utilize ETF portfolios when necessary and structure them similarly to our individual bond portfolios.
Monitor and actively manage fixed income portfolios when individual issues mature or portfolio cash flows change.
Adjust maturities based on client liquidity needs or a change in our team’s interest rate forecast.


 
 
What Makes Us Different?

Individual Securities: We are long-term investors in 25 to 35 companies with durable competitive advantages. Our stock selection process, tied together with strategic asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing, has driven our solid long-term results.


Portfolio Customization: Because we invest in individual securities, we can tailor our advice around your existing holdings and gradually transform your portfolio to meet agreed-upon objectives.


Client-Centric Focus: We never promote the hottest new investment product. Instead, on a case-by-case basis, we may select complementary, low-cost ETF products in our portfolios to add diversification, gain exposure to an undervalued asset class and reduce overall portfolio risk.


Portfolio Manage Relationship: We believe having direct access to the investment decision-maker leads to greater accountability and a stronger relationship in the long run. Your portfolio manager is your long-term partner.


Fees: Because we invest your assets directly in individual securities, you avoid an extra layer or fees many of our brokerage competitors charge by hiring outside managers for their wrap programs.


Transparency: From knowing who manages your money to exactly which securities you own, how you are doing relative to your goals and precisely what you are charged – we believe simple transparency is good for business.

What Makes Us Different?

Individual Securities
We are long-term investors in 25 to 35 companies with durable competitive advantages. Our stock selection process, tied together with strategic asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing, has driven our solid long-term results.
Portfolio Customization
Because we invest in individual securities, we can tailor our advice around your existing holdings and gradually transform your portfolio to meet agreed-upon objectives.
Client-Centric Focus
We never promote the hottest new investment product.  Instead, we stay true to our investment process in all market environments – avoiding the urge to chase short-term returns in speculative investments.
Portfolio Manager Relationship
We believe having direct access to the investment decision-maker leads to greater accountability and a stronger relationship in the long run. Your portfolio manager is your financial quarterback and long-term partner.
Fees
Because we invest directly into companies on your behalf, you eliminate the middleman and avoid the extra layer of fees that many of our competitors charge by hiring outside managers for their wrap account programs.
Transparency
From knowing who manages your money to exactly which securities you own, how you are doing relative to your goals and precisely what you are charged – we believe simple transparency is good for business.

















Our Commitment | LaFleur & Godfrey    






























 











Our Commitment
Disciplined Investing

 


Growing Wealth

Investment Philosophy
The Best of Both Worlds: Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP-Style Investing). Co-founder Jim LaFleur said it best: “Our investment philosophy was simple and still holds true today – identify quality companies with good growth prospects that are run by ethical and competent managers. Buy them at a reasonable price and, importantly, be patient”.
Personal Portfolio Customization
We do not believe that one size fits all. We tailor our advice around your existing holdings and personally select securities based on your individual goals and risk tolerance – all while keeping a keen eye on costs and tax consequences.
Owning Companies vs. Owning Investment Products
Jim LaFleur and Rick Godfrey subscribed to the theory of investing that, over the long run, owning a focused, yet diversified portfolio of individual companies could outperform a mix of investment products (sometimes consisting of several hundred companies). Our ‘know-what-you-own’ approach to investing has served our clients very well through the years by keeping transparency high, turnover low and costs down.
The Pie vs. The Nine Boxes vs. The Oracle 
Successful investing in an ever-changing world requires discipline. LaFleur & Godfrey’s focused investment process helps clients navigate through the economic and market landscape and towards their long-term goals.  Our Warren Buffett-like individual stock and bond approach, without being tied to a ‘pie’ or ‘nine box’ investment strategy, provides a ‘common sense’ investing solution for Main Street while avoiding many of the pitfalls and products offered by Wall Street.

Focused, Mega Trend Investing!
Our investment process allows us to see the forest for the trees. We view the investment world through a lens that focuses on both macroeconomic (top-down) factors and company-specific (bottom-up) fundamentals. This two-way approach enables us to better view the market’s opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. The outcome of this process results in a concentration of companies benefiting from ‘mega trends’ in sectors and industries experiencing strong innovation and disruption for many years to come.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (7.04% upside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
