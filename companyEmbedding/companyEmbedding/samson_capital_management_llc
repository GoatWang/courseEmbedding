Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (4.11% upside)

Geography










 In recent years, much of the new natural resource supply (oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids) in the United States has been tied to emerging shale plays.  While supply had already been, it wasn’t until recent years that technological advances made it cost effective to drill in these “unconventional” plays.  Some of the major areas include the Bakken, Marcellus, Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shales.  Some of the discoveries that more recently have been explored include the Utica, New Albany and Niobrara shale plays.As you can see on the map below, the proximity of the shale plays requires energy infrastructure to be put in place to move the resources to end markets.  Master Limited Partnerships play a very critical role in the build-out of this infrastructure by providing exploration and production companies with the means to gather, process, fractionate, store and deliver the natural resources to their destinations.  According to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), which highlights the long term expansion in energy demand and infrastructure spending, they estimate that the energy industry will spend approximately $447Bn-$597Bn from 2016 through 2035.  Of those amounts, about 60% is expected to be spent on natural gas related infrastructure, 31% on oil-related infrastructure and 9% on NGL-related infrastructure.  This data takes into account the recent declines in energy prices that we have witnessed in 2015-16.
