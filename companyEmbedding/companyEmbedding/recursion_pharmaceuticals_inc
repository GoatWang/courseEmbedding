100 new treatments by 2025
​Supported by our talented team and groundbreaking platform, we are reinventing the traditional focus of pharmaceutical discovery. Rather than the inefficient strategy of intensely studying an explicit molecular target related to a specific disease of interest, we combine the latest in biology, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence to make many discoveries in parallel.

The intersection of experimental biology, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence
Our unique platform is what sets us apart. Poised at the crossroads of biology and computation, the Recursion approach leverages the most advanced high-throughput biology and artificial intelligence to rapidly discover treatments for thousands of diseases - all for the price of one.​ 

​Rich Data from Images​Our technology takes advantage of advanced imaging to provide rich datasets quickly and cheaply. Just as patients with certain genetic diseases may have a specific phenotype, cells modeling genetic disease often display specific structural signatures. For many diseases, these phenotypes are accessible via cellular images.​






​Proprietary Cellular “Fingerprints”​​We use the latest biological tools to build hundreds of unique cellular disease models. We image tens of thousands of cells per model and extract nearly 1,000 structural features from every cell. Using these features, we develop proprietary cellular “fingerprints”, branded Phenoprint, of cells in health and disease. With Phenoprint in hand, we can ask whether any drug rescues diseased cells back to health. ​
 






 




​Finding New Treatments​Our proprietary, interactive data visualization software enables our biologists to query and understand the results of phenotypic screens, drug screens, and target discovery screens with immediate access to raw images and underlying data. In-depth analysis enables interrogation of complex biological interactions for drug repurposing, New Chemical Entity discovery, and target discovery.​

Partnership on Validated Discoveries​With broad biological expertise in house, our insights are always validated using gold-standard in vitro (and, in certain circumstances, in vivo) assays. Our partners act on these validated discoveries, resulting in faster and lower-cost drug development
