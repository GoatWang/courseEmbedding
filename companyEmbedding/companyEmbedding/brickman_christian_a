            This music is pure Brickman.  If you like clear piano music then Jim Brickman's albums are great.  This one is no exception.  Relaxing music with worship songs.  Listen any time of day, but especially nice to go to sleep with.

Featured Music- Hills and Valleys- Tauren Wells More
Michigan native Tauren Wells started his music career at Indiana Bible College, forming the group Royal Tailor with a trio of classmate friends. From their two albums, the group earned two Grammy nominations, and won the Dove Award for New Artist of the Year. However, when life on the road began to take it's toll on the group, Tauren persevered, and launched his solo career with Essential Records. 
After landing a key spot in the multi-million-view Dude Perfect series with his "Undefeated" KB collaboration, Wells returns with a full length collection of electrifying pop-rock anthems and heartfelt songs of faith.  Read More

Following her early days as a church pianist in hometown Colorado Springs, Nicole gained recognition at a GMA sponsored music contest, captivating audiences with her original music and lyrical gifts.

Caleb (Randy Wayne, To Save A Life) is a young skater who's ill mother (Roseanna Arquette, Pulp Fiction) and absent father (John Schneider, October Baby), leaves him reaching for the only hope he has - becoming a sponsored skater. After discovering a stack of old letters, he set out to find the father he never knew and inadvertently begins a journey he never could have expected. Caleb's story explores what happens when we let go of our anger and pain and forgive those who have hurt us the most, just as God forgives us. Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 108 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!

Featured Music- Hills and Valleys- Tauren Wells More
Michigan native Tauren Wells started his music career at Indiana Bible College, forming the group Royal Tailor with a trio of classmate friends.
