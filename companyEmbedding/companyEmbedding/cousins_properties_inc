Client Success
Cousins Properties Inc.






We wanted a fully integrated, across-the-board solution to check off a whole bunch of boxes for us. We found that with Yardi.Leeann Attanucci, Vice President, Corporate Controller 
The CompanyAtlanta-based Cousins Properties Inc. has kept pace with its evolving business environment by leveraging multiple business solutions as part of its Yardi Voyager property management and accounting platform. “We like the idea of an integrated system. We wanted Yardi as our solution and it has been the right choice for us,” said Dennis Granger, vice president of information systems for Cousins.The ChallengeTechnology Upgrade NeededCousins prides itself on having best-in-class assets and a strong balance sheet that allow the company to capitalize quickly on new acquisition opportunities. Recent acquisitions and mergers added dozens of properties and millions of square feet to its portfolio. Meeting increased reporting obligations and service expectations for its growing clientele required new solutions for tenant services, consolidations, reporting and maintenance.The SolutionYardi Commercial SuiteWith Yardi Voyager established as its core platform, Cousins connected with tenants online, automated budgeting, expanded reporting and extended mobility to its maintenance staff.The StoryImproved Tenant Service“Before COMMERCIALCafé and Advanced Maintenance, tenants had to call the property management office. If nobody was available, the response could be delayed. Now our engineers can go straight to their mobile devices, without any intervening steps, and get right to the request. It saves time for everybody, and the maintenance record goes straight into the tenant ledger in Voyager,” said Granger.

New Dimensions for Budgeting
“Advanced Budgeting & Forecasting strengthens our control of the budgeting process by making it easy to reforecast quarterly. Property accountants, managers and others can work their pieces of the budget simultaneously. In addition, the solution helps us streamline rent calculations, depreciations and other factors,” Attanucci said. 
She added, “We do our budgets to a degree that would make most people lose their minds. The level of detail we expect to see and drill into equals or exceeds anybody else’s, and the integrated solution from Yardi makes that possible.”
New Consolidation, Drilldown and Reporting 
“Yardi Investment Management also helped us with the special way we consolidate our legal entity structure. If an asset was 100% owned we had to add across and make manual consolidation entries. If it was 50% owned, we multiplied it out by 50%, booked it as a consolidating entry and added all of the consolidating entries. Now we have a much more efficient rollup structure. In addition, role-based access to Voyager lets the tax people see what went through any given legal entity,” Attanucci said. 
Granger added, “Yardi Investment Management gives us the ability to look from the top down, which is really helpful—we can see what we’re reporting to the SEC on our consolidated statements, and we can see individual property information. We can take those numbers, drill down and create Yardi spreadsheet reports to see what’s coming from certain entities and properties.
“We’re also pleased with the ability to deliver a battery of reports to upper management every month. It no longer takes days to get them together, and we don’t have to call the accountants for the information.”
Constructing Precision 
“Yardi Construction Management gives us visibility into our construction budgets that we couldn’t get from the spreadsheets we previously used,” Granger said. “We also have process consistency—development managers no longer keep track their own way, with different details and update schedules. With construction integrated into the general ledger, we have consistent reporting and workflows for budgeting and approvals across the board.” 
“We have good systems and a solid balance sheet in place. This combination gives us the means to pursue acquisitions aggressively. We can respond and analyze opportunities faster, and close deals more quickly,” Attanucci said.

About Us 









We started out as a small software startup focused on quality software and customer satisfaction. Now, moving into our fourth decade, Yardi is a large software corporation with offices worldwide — and a still-unwavering focus on quality software and customer satisfaction.








Our Company
Established in 1984, Yardi has grown dramatically over the last three decades to become the leading provider of high-performance software solutions for the real estate industry. Today, we employ over 5,000 dedicated professionals working in over 30 offices throughout North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Australia.
Since its founding, Yardi has set the standard for real estate software solutions with a combination of responsiveness and technical innovation. We understand the unique needs of the industry’s various segments and have the technical expertise and vision necessary to translate that understanding into powerful solutions that meet and exceed those needs.


Our Philosophy
Key to our longevity and stature in the industry is the importance Yardi places on relationships – both outside and inside the company. This means listening to our clients and employees and actively seeking their feedback in designing, developing, and supporting our products. We view every client affiliation as a long-term relationship, one in which our goal is to ensure the ongoing satisfaction and goodwill of our clients by providing them with unparalleled products and service.
We regard our employees as our most valuable asset. Bricks and mortar do not make a successful company, people do. Without the commitment, enthusiasm, and expertise of our employees, Yardi would not be the industry leader it is today. With this in mind, Yardi has created an environment for its employees that empowers, encourages, and challenges them to work to their highest potential so that, together, we can provide our clients with the superior products and service they deserve and have come to expect from us.

Our Regard for Community
Yardi considers itself an integral part of the communities in which it operates and, by extension, the larger global community.
As such, we believe it is vitally important to contribute to the health and well being of those communities, whether by volunteering time and energy to worthwhile causes or providing financial support to advance humanitarian goals.

Cousins Properties Stock Sees Short Interest Drop 18%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/29/2016 settlement date, which shows a 2,345,522 share decrease in total short interest for Cousins Properties Inc , to 10,652,625, a decrease of 18.05% since 04/15/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Cousins Properties, Inc., headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a real estate investment trust,[1][2] and one of the oldest publicly traded real estate companies in the country.[3] It was formed in 1958[4] by Tom Cousins and has been publicly traded since 1962.[5][6] It became a real estate investment trust in 1987.[7]
In 2009, its annual revenues were $224.9 million.[8] In 2006, it was described by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as "the metro area's leading developer".[9][10] The company developed and later sold the Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta, at the time the tallest building in the Southern United States.[11] Other notable structures that it has developed include CNN Center, Omni Coliseum, and 191 Peachtree Tower in Atlanta,[5] [12][13][14] and the Frost Bank Tower in Austin, Texas.[15] Among other holdings, it also owns and operates the American Cancer Society Center in Atlanta.[12]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
