June 07, 2017 09:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOXBOROUGH, Mass. & DENVER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sterilis 
      LLC, the innovator in regulated medical waste management, is proud 
      to announce that its recently introduced device, which provides safe, 
      sustainable remediation of regulated medical waste (RMW) on-site and 
      at-point-of-care, has been awarded an Environmental Leader 2017 
      Top Product of the Year Award. Sterilis President Jeff Bell accepted the 
      award on June 6th at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference 
      awards dinner in Denver. Other winners included Samsung, Disney, 
      Timberland and General Motors (GM).
    


      The Sterilis device is a safer, more sustainable, and proven alternative 
      to the decades-old method of hauling dangerous regulated medical waste 
      (also known as infectious waste) off-site by truck to be incinerated. 
      Sterilis’ device uses steam sterilization and grinding technologies to 
      transform infectious waste into a harmless confetti-like material, which 
      can be disposed of in the general waste stream. The Sterilis method of 
      disposal eliminates toxic air pollution created when RMW is incinerated, 
      which is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
    

      “We created the Sterilis device to address a burning need for more 
      sustainable and safer disposal of medical waste, and we are honored to 
      see our efforts recognized by Environmental Leader,” said Jeff Bell, 
      founder, president, chief financial officer and chairman of the Board of 
      Directors at Sterilis. “The Sterilis method for infectious waste 
      disposal disrupts the RMW industry by allowing facilities to safely 
      remediate waste on-site and at point-of-care using steam sterilization 
      and grinding technologies, which reduces the waste volume by about 80 
      percent. Not only does this create a smaller waste footprint, but it 
      protects the environment by preventing the need for waste incineration, 
      which has been cited by the EPA as a major contributor to climate 
      change.”
    

      Launched earlier this year, the Sterilis device is already being used by 
      over 40 health facilities to reduce their dependence on the haul and 
      burn method of waste disposal and improve sustainability. The patented 
      system is about the size of an office photocopier and is completely 
      portable. It plugs into a standard electrical outlet and requires no 
      plumbing or drainage. Early adopters of the device include dialysis 
      centers, surgery centers, dermatology and ophthalmology centers, 
      hospitals, clinical labs, needle-exchange programs, Federally Qualified 
      Health Centers (FQHCs), among others.
    

      According to the judges, “This product is very innovative and solves a 
      couple of issues uniquely and reduces waste stream volume and handling 
      issues. The ability to reduce the volume and danger earlier in the 
      medical waste life-cycle impact all downstream handling issues and 
      costs.... by reducing the waste, hauling cost, and carbon emissions.”
    


        The Sterilis device is a proven method of safely disposing of harmful 
        regulated medical waste. A few key benefits also include: Improved 
        hospital and waste worker safety by limiting multiple touch points 
        associated with current waste disposal methods.
      

        Substantially decreases the cradle-to-grave liability held by 
        hospitals, clinics, and other health facilities when medical waste is 
        sent by truck to be remediated by treating infectious waste on site 
        and at point-of-generation.
      

        Eliminates unnecessary paper documents currently needed with the 
        current “haul and burn” approach through IoT-enabled software that 
        automatically tracks and stores all required regulatory data in the 
        cloud, where it can be accessed and monitored at any time.

We have been handling regulated medical waste the same way today as when I got into nursing 37 years ago.  It’s about time someone used technology to protect healthcare professionals.


- Lilian Longo, R.N., M.A.
It’s much more economical. It’s better for the environment. It reduces risk by eliminating the need to store medical waste on-site.  For me, Sterilis was a very easy decision.


- Dr. Amy Forman Taub - Advanced Dermatology Lincolnshire, Illinois
“The Healthcare Industry is constantly being challenged to control costs while providing better care for patients. Sterilis has the product to lower patient and employee risk, contain rising costs with a fixed cost solution, and make facilities more sustainable,” said Sandy Kurtz. “Sterilis has a unique technology whereby it can treat regulated medical waste at point-of-care that can be applied in many healthcare situations.”


- Sandy Kurtz, MD
“I’m always on the lookout for new technologies that will improve patient care and improve our practice. The Sterilis System gives us a safe and effective way to treat regulated medical waste while reducing our risk and liability.”


- Dr. Jeffrey Dover - Skincare Physicians Chestnut Hill, MA
“Sterilis is an industry disrupter that will profoundly change the way medical waste is managed. No longer is it acceptable to package, store and transport the massive quantities of medical waste generated by the United States medical system to a few processing plants scattered across the country,”


- Dr. Seth Yellin - Marietta Facial Plastic Surgery, Laser & Aesthetics Center
“Sterilis is a simple solution that allowed us to eliminate the storage of hazardous medical waste along with the record keeping. It also greatly reduced the cost of disposing of our regulated materials. It is a win, win, win for any practice or surgical center that generates medical waste! ”


- Dr. Michael Oats - Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston
“The inherent liability and risks of trucking contaminated waste across the country for disposal, the fossil fuel consumed in the process, and the greenhouse gases generated make this mode of medical waste disposal both outdated and expensive. By treating contaminated medical waste of all kinds on site, at the location where it is created, and then disposing of the treated material as regular trash, medical facilities will lower their costs, our roads will be less crowded and safer and the environment will benefit. Everybody wins!”


- Dr. Seth Yellin - Marietta Facial Plastic Surgery, Laser & Aesthetics Center

Sterilis On-Site, On-Demand Regulated Medical Waste Disposal Device 
      Recognized for Ability to More Safely and Sustainably Treat Infectious 
      Medical Waste

      Sterilis 
      LLC, the innovator in regulated medical waste management, is proud 
      to announce that its recently introduced device, which provides safe, 
      sustainable remediation of regulated medical waste (RMW) on-site and 
      at-point-of-care, has been awarded an Environmental Leader 2017 
      Top Product of the Year Award. Sterilis President Jeff Bell accepted the 
      award on June 6th at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference 
      awards dinner in Denver. Other winners included Samsung, Disney, 
      Timberland and General Motors (GM).
    

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: 
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170607005769/en/



The Sterilis device uses a patented design that combines a steam sterilizer with a grinder and allows infectious regulated medical waste (RMW) to be treated on-site and on-demand at point-of-care in about 60 minutes. (Photo: Business Wire)  


      The Sterilis device is a safer, more sustainable, and proven alternative 
      to the decades-old method of hauling dangerous regulated medical waste 
      (also known as infectious waste) off-site by truck to be incinerated. 
      Sterilis’ device uses steam sterilization and grinding technologies to 
      transform infectious waste into a harmless confetti-like material, which 
      can be disposed of in the general waste stream. The Sterilis method of 
      disposal eliminates toxic air pollution created when RMW is incinerated, 
      which is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
    

      “We created the Sterilis device to address a burning need for more 
      sustainable and safer disposal of medical waste, and we are honored to 
      see our efforts recognized by Environmental Leader,” said Jeff Bell, 
      founder, president, chief financial officer and chairman of the Board of 
      Directors at Sterilis. “The Sterilis method for infectious waste 
      disposal disrupts the RMW industry by allowing facilities to safely 
      remediate waste on-site and at point-of-care using steam sterilization 
      and grinding technologies, which reduces the waste volume by about 80 
      percent. Not only does this create a smaller waste footprint, but it 
      protects the environment by preventing the need for waste incineration, 
      which has been cited by the EPA as a major contributor to climate 
      change.”
    

      Launched earlier this year, the Sterilis device is already being used by 
      over 40 health facilities to reduce their dependence on the haul and 
      burn method of waste disposal and improve sustainability. The patented 
      system is about the size of an office photocopier and is completely 
      portable. It plugs into a standard electrical outlet and requires no 
      plumbing or drainage. Early adopters of the device include dialysis 
      centers, surgery centers, dermatology and ophthalmology centers, 
      hospitals, clinical labs, needle-exchange programs, Federally Qualified 
      Health Centers (FQHCs), among others.
    

      According to the judges, “This product is very innovative and solves a 
      couple of issues uniquely and reduces waste stream volume and handling 
      issues. The ability to reduce the volume and danger earlier in the 
      medical waste life-cycle impact all downstream handling issues and 
      costs.... by reducing the waste, hauling cost, and carbon emissions.”
    


        The Sterilis device is a proven method of safely disposing of harmful 
        regulated medical waste. A few key benefits also include: Improved 
        hospital and waste worker safety by limiting multiple touch points 
        associated with current waste disposal methods.
      

        Substantially decreases the cradle-to-grave liability held by 
        hospitals, clinics, and other health facilities when medical waste is 
        sent by truck to be remediated by treating infectious waste on site 
        and at point-of-generation.
      

        Eliminates unnecessary paper documents currently needed with the 
        current “haul and burn” approach through IoT-enabled software that 
        automatically tracks and stores all required regulatory data in the 
        cloud, where it can be accessed and monitored at any time.

BOXBOROUGH, Mass. & DENVER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      Sterilis       LLC, the innovator in regulated medical waste management, is proud       to announce that its recently introduced device, which provides safe,       sustainable remediation of regulated medical waste (RMW) on-site and       at-point-of-care, has been awarded an Environmental Leader 2017       Top Product of the Year Award. Sterilis President Jeff Bell accepted the       award on June 6th at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference       awards dinner in Denver. Other winners included Samsung, Disney,       Timberland and General Motors (GM).    This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170607005769/en/ The Sterilis device uses a patented design that combines a steam sterilizer with a grinder and allows infectious regulated medical waste (RMW) to be treated on-site and on-demand at point-of-care in about 60 minutes. (Photo: Business Wire)        The Sterilis device is a safer, more sustainable, and proven alternative       to the decades-old method of hauling dangerous regulated medical waste       (also known as infectious waste) off-site by truck to be incinerated.       Sterilis’ device uses steam sterilization and grinding technologies to       transform infectious waste into a harmless confetti-like material, which       can be disposed of in the general waste stream. The Sterilis method of       disposal eliminates toxic air pollution created when RMW is incinerated,       which is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.          “We created the Sterilis device to address a burning need for more       sustainable and safer disposal of medical waste, and we are honored to       see our efforts recognized by Environmental Leader,” said Jeff Bell,       founder, president, chief financial officer and chairman of the Board of       Directors at Sterilis. “The Sterilis method for infectious waste       disposal disrupts the RMW industry by allowing facilities to safely       remediate waste on-site and at point-of-care using steam sterilization       and grinding technologies, which reduces the waste volume by about 80       percent. Not only does this create a smaller waste footprint, but it       protects the environment by preventing the need for waste incineration,       which has been cited by the EPA as a major contributor to climate       change.”          Launched earlier this year, the Sterilis device is already being used by       over 40 health facilities to reduce their dependence on the haul and       burn method of waste disposal and improve sustainability. The patented       system is about the size of an office photocopier and is completely       portable. It plugs into a standard electrical outlet and requires no       plumbing or drainage. Early adopters of the device include dialysis       centers, surgery centers, dermatology and ophthalmology centers,       hospitals, clinical labs, needle-exchange programs, Federally Qualified       Health Centers (FQHCs), among others.          According to the judges, “This product is very innovative and solves a       couple of issues uniquely and reduces waste stream volume and handling       issues. The ability to reduce the volume and danger earlier in the       medical waste life-cycle impact all downstream handling issues and       costs.... by reducing the waste, hauling cost, and carbon emissions.”            The Sterilis device is a proven method of safely disposing of harmful         regulated medical waste. A few key benefits also include: Improved         hospital and waste worker safety by limiting multiple touch points         associated with current waste disposal methods.               Substantially decreases the cradle-to-grave liability held by         hospitals, clinics, and other health facilities when medical waste is         sent by truck to be remediated by treating infectious waste on site         and at point-of-generation.               Eliminates unnecessary paper documents currently needed with the         current “haul and burn” approach through IoT-enabled software that         automatically tracks and stores all required regulatory data in the         cloud, where it can be accessed and monitored at any time.
