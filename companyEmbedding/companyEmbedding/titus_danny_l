Product Spotlight
TJD - Low Flow Architectural Diffuser

Titus has a solution for new low energy codes that employ the “Power of off” philosophy. The TJD is our architectural diffuser with an engineered nozzle distribution manifold that provides great throw patterns and high mixing under extremely low airflow that would dump from any other conventional ceiling diffuser.
 
The TJD is perfect for buildings employing dedicated outside air distribution systems, spaces with low loads and or intermittent occupancy, such as exam rooms, basically any space that require low airflow density.

Products
Diffusers
Diffusers have one of the most important functions in air management; to control the pattern of the airflow into an occupied space. Our diffusers are designed by an experienced staff of engineers that use the latest technology to test our products within current industry standards. Several Titus diffusers are also GreenSpec Listed to help achieve LEED certification.

Terminal Units
Titus offers several types of units to match the many styles of mechanical systems used in buildings. Additionally, our terminal units are available with options that control sound for quieter systems and special surface treatments that help ensure higher air quality levels for healthcare facilities like hospitals or high-tech manufacturing. Some Titus terminal units are GreenSpec Listed and can assist in achieving LEED certification.

Grilles
Titus grilles are designed by a skilled engineering staff using the latest technology and are tested by the most current industry standards and methods. Grilles typically direct air out of a duct nearly the same size as the opening. Titus offers a wide variety of grilles to ensure flexibility for architects and engineers.

Displacement Ventilation
Displacement Ventilation is a great alternative to conventional overhead ceiling supply systems. Displacement ventilation provides design flexibility, energy savings, and the highest level of indoor air quality (IAQ). The higher supply temperature and smaller air handler/system can generate energy savings. Also, the addition of more free cooling days from bringing outside air in contributes toward energy savings. On the IAQ side, DV has a ventilation effectiveness factor of 1.2 which translates to a 20% bonus when designing for ventilation requirements per ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007.

Chilled Beam
Chilled Beams are designed to provide energy savings, excellent comfort and operate with minimal noise. When used with dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) and a dedicated Chilled Beam chiller, chilled beam systems can realize energy savings of 15-20%. An additional 20-25% savings can be realized from downsized ventilation systems due to the high efficiency of the water system for the sensible load.

UnderFloor
UFAD systems utilize the space under an access floor as an air plenum. Properly designed UFAD systems take advantage of thermal stratification. ASHRAE recommends that, for comfort, the temperature in the occupied zone be between 73 degrees and 77 degrees F, relative humidity be between 25 - 60%, and the maximum velocity in occupied zone be 50 fpm in cooling or 30 fpm in heating. The key to successful underfloor systems is the ability of the underfloor diffuser to rapidly mix room air into the supply air at low velocities.

VAV Diffusers
Titus brings both accuracy and flexibility to the variable air volume (VAV) market with T3SQ VAV diffusers. The T3SQ combines the functions of a VAV terminal and a high performance diffuser in one. The T3SQ modulates the air volume delivered to a zone to accurately control cooling and heating conditions. The unique variable geometry design results in maximum air distribution effectiveness at any air flow, for superior comfort conditions. The T3SQ is also a  GreenSpec Listed product and can contribute toward achieving LEED  credits.

Fan Coils
Titus fan coils are the clear choice in the industry. They are designed and engineered for a wide range of applications including: apartments and condominiums, hotels, motels, schools and universities, hospitals and nursing homes. The accessories associated with controlling fan coil units can contribute toward energy savings and offer wireless innovative ways for unit control.

New Fan Coils
Titus fan coils are the clear choice in the industry. They are designed and engineered for a wide range of applications including: apartments and condominiums, hotels, motels, schools and universities, hospitals and nursing homes.

Blower Coils
Titus horizontal and vertical belt drive blower coils offer a wide range of application flexibility, while maintaining a simple, easy to install unit design. These units are intended to provide comfort cooling and heating within a small footprint. They may be applied in many types of building structures including schools, office buildings, hospitals, condominiums, assisted living facilities, apartments and stores. Applications can be constant or variable volume. 


Learn more about Blower Coils

Air Handlers
Small air handlers, sometimes referred to as blower coils, are intended for common areas and large meeting rooms in hotels, condominiums, universities and hospitals. These products are natural companions to Titus fan coils, yet air handlers supply greater airflow and coil capacity. With a wide variety of options and standard features, Titus air handlers provide design flexibility with belt-driven fans, multi-row coil capability and various factory options.
