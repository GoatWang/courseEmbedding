    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Home  Overview  TouchPad Family 



TouchPad™ Family
It’s not enough just to be the acknowledged pioneer in touchpad technology.   Synaptics has relentlessly built upon its two decades of touchpad innovation and market leadership, developing products based on such groundbreaking technology as force navigation, multi-finger gesturing, and biometric security.


  TouchPadIntuitiveness. Integration. Robustness. These are the trademarks of the Synaptics TouchPad family. Synaptics pioneered touchpads in computing and since then has expanded its TouchPad line for a host of other emerging applications.Explore


  ClickPad™Less is better -- at least when it comes to touchpad input. By removing external buttons, ClickPad gives users an highly integrated "clickable TouchPad" with a larger input area.Explore


  ForcePad™The pressure's on -- and that's a good thing. ForcePad presents a new dimension in how users interface with machines, using varying levels of pressure to enable a more intuitive, precise user interaction.Explore


  SecurePad™As PC notebooks become more sophisticated, so too do their security requirements. SecurePad blends Synaptics TouchPad technology with fingerprint authentication that assures users' easy -- and secure -- login.Explore

History[edit]
Synaptics was founded in 1986 by scientists and engineers Federico Faggin and Carver Mead, inspired by their interest in neural networks and their applications in technologies. Faggin and Mead applied their research and discoveries on neural networks and transistors on chips to build touch sensing solutions. The name of the company was derived from this combination, blending synapse and electronics.
During Synaptics' early years, the laptop industry was struggling to make devices thinner because the spherical trackballs included in them required thicker device builds. Synaptics' founders recognized this issue and in 1992, used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world's first touchpad,[3] which Apple adopted in 1995. The touchpad was subsequently adopted by other leading computer manufacturers of the time, including Compaq and Dell, launching Synaptics' growth as a company and establishing touchpads as a standard feature in notebook PCs. As integration of the touchpad grew, Synaptics continued to refine its technology, building a vision to integrate it with other solutions and create a range of human interface technologies to expand the company.
Since then, Synaptics' solutions have been adopted in various markets beyond notebook computers. In 2005, Synaptics' sensor technology was featured in the world's first mobile phone to use capacitive-touch technology, the Samsung B310. In 2007, LG launched its Prada phone featuring Synaptics' touch sensors, marking the world's first capacitive-touchscreen mobile phone. Synaptics' touchscreen technology was also featured in Logitech's Harmony family, which debuted in 2008 and brought capacitive-touch capabilities to universal remote controls.
In 2011, current CEO Rick Bergman was appointed to succeed Francis Lee (CEO from 1999-2011) and drive Synaptics' expansion in to new markets.
In 2012, Synaptics introduced the world's first full-function capacitive-touch solution to incorporate pressure recognition (AKA force sensing), enabling multi-finger and variable-force input. The following year, Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors, a fingerprint sensor vendor based in San Jose, adding biometrics and fingerprint sensing to Synaptics' portfolio of solutions.[4]
Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc., a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays, in 2014. Synaptics purchased Renesas SP for approximately JPY48.5B ($475 million) for 100% of the company.[5] The acquisition enabled Synaptics to establish an integrated portfolio of touch and display driver technologies.
The company has since expanded in to additional markets including automotive, wearables and PC peripherals in 2015. Synaptics in 2015 had 1600+ granted and pending patents for human interface solutions.[6] In FY15, Synaptics reported $1.703 billion in revenue and cited a +46% compound annual growth rate.[6]
In June 2017 Synaptics announced it was acquiring Conexant Systems for $341 million and Marvell Technology Group's Multimedia Solutions unit for $95 million.[7]
Technology[edit]
Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology, as opposed to resistive touchscreen technologies. Capacitive touch sensing works by sensing the electrical properties of the finger(s) touching the sensor; a resistive touchscreen senses direct pressure between two clear electrical layers that are separated by a small space, requiring an amount of force.[8] Capacitive touch sensing solutions are solid state, making them more robust than resistive solutions.
Synaptics's human interface solutions are currently based upon the following key technologies:


Capacitive active pen
Capacitive force sensing
Capacitive position sensing
Display systems and circuit
Fingerprint sensing
Mixed-signal integrated circuit
Multi-touch
Pattern recognition
Proprietary microcontroller
ThinTouch
Transparent capacitive position sensing

Synaptics touchpad


Synaptics' core product families deliver touch sensing, display and biometrics solutions. They include touchpads, touch controllers, fingerprint sensors and integrated solutions.
TouchPad Family[9] - touch-sensitive trackpads that sense the position and movement of one or more fingers on their surfaces. the TouchPad's core market is notebook PCs and includes:

TouchPad- Module enabling user navigation via touch interface
ClickPad- "Clickable TouchPad" that also serves as a button
ForcePad- TouchPad with pressure-sensitive scrolling and zooming, and press-to-click capabilities anywhere on the TouchPad
SecurePad- TouchPad with fingerprint authentication enabling users to authorize online transactions, login to websites and access applications

ClearPad Touch Controllers[10] - Capacitive-touch controllers with minimal size and low power requirements, tailored for specific applications:

Series 1 - for compact displays
Series 2 - for smartphone touchscreens
Series 3 - for more feature-rich mobile device displays
Series 7 - for tablet, PC, notebook, automotive and other applications requiring larger touchscreens

Natural ID Fingerprint Sensors (Biometrics)[11] - Series of fingerprint authentication sensors, combining biometrics and advanced encryption with security, ease of use and cost efficiency. They feature Synaptics' SentryPoint, which is a suite of security features aggregated to protect users' personal biometric information. Natural ID sensors also function under glass, making it possible to eliminate the home button on smartphones.
ClearView Display Drivers[12] - Display driver integrated circuits (DDIC) with the industry's smallest display ICs and ultra-HD resolution support for more dynamic, design friendly and power-efficient display options, as well as reduced image-load times.
TouchView Integrated Touch and Display Controllers[13] - Solutions integrating touch and display technology in to single and two-chip solutions enabling devices to be thinner and lighter at lower costs. Synaptics touch and display driver integration (TDDI) supports ClearForce for variable force sensing, and ClearView DDIC features for enhancing display brightness, color, contrast and readability in sunlight, and power efficiency. For advanced touch features, TouchView products support virtually all ClearPad touch controller features.
Industry alliances[edit]
Synaptics is a founding member of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance and the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI).
The FIDO Alliance is an industry consortium that aims to make authentication stronger and simpler, and to reduce reliance on passwords.[14] Synaptics' Corporate Development Vice President, Adnan Raza, sits on the FIDO Alliance board, representing Synaptics. Other notable Board Members include Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Lenovo, Qualcomm, RSA, Samsung, Bank of America, Visa, Discover, American Express and MasterCard.
USI is an organization of leading OEMs, stylus and touch controller manufacturers driving industry standards to promote interoperable active styluses with touch-enabled devices such as phones, tablets and computing and entertainment platforms. Synaptics' Senior Director of Integrated Display and Touch Products, Jeff Lukanc, is Vice President of USI.
Manufacturing & supply chain[edit]
Synaptics' manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which it outsource all of its production requirements and generally drop ship its products directly to its customers from its contract manufacturers’ facilities. This eliminates the need for significant capital expenditures and allows the company to minimize its investment in inventories.
The company provides its contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. It uses two third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and four third-party packaging manufacturers to package its proprietary ASICs.
In certain cases, it relies on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of its products.[15]

History[edit]
Synaptics was founded in 1986 by scientists and engineers Federico Faggin and Carver Mead, inspired by their interest in neural networks and their applications in technologies. Faggin and Mead applied their research and discoveries on neural networks and transistors on chips to build touch sensing solutions. The name of the company was derived from this combination, blending synapse and electronics.
During Synaptics' early years, the laptop industry was struggling to make devices thinner because the spherical trackballs included in them required thicker device builds. Synaptics' founders recognized this issue and in 1992, used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world's first touchpad,[3] which Apple adopted in 1995. The touchpad was subsequently adopted by other leading computer manufacturers of the time, including Compaq and Dell, launching Synaptics' growth as a company and establishing touchpads as a standard feature in notebook PCs. As integration of the touchpad grew, Synaptics continued to refine its technology, building a vision to integrate it with other solutions and create a range of human interface technologies to expand the company.
Since then, Synaptics' solutions have been adopted in various markets beyond notebook computers. In 2005, Synaptics' sensor technology was featured in the world's first mobile phone to use capacitive-touch technology, the Samsung B310. In 2007, LG launched its Prada phone featuring Synaptics' touch sensors, marking the world's first capacitive-touchscreen mobile phone. Synaptics' touchscreen technology was also featured in Logitech's Harmony family, which debuted in 2008 and brought capacitive-touch capabilities to universal remote controls.
In 2011, current CEO Rick Bergman was appointed to succeed Francis Lee (CEO from 1999-2011) and drive Synaptics' expansion in to new markets.
In 2012, Synaptics introduced the world's first full-function capacitive-touch solution to incorporate pressure recognition (AKA force sensing), enabling multi-finger and variable-force input. The following year, Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors, a fingerprint sensor vendor based in San Jose, adding biometrics and fingerprint sensing to Synaptics' portfolio of solutions.[4]
Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc., a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays, in 2014. Synaptics purchased Renesas SP for approximately JPY48.5B ($475 million) for 100% of the company.[5] The acquisition enabled Synaptics to establish an integrated portfolio of touch and display driver technologies.
The company has since expanded in to additional markets including automotive, wearables and PC peripherals in 2015. Synaptics in 2015 had 1600+ granted and pending patents for human interface solutions.[6] In FY15, Synaptics reported $1.703 billion in revenue and cited a +46% compound annual growth rate.[6]
In June 2017 Synaptics announced it was acquiring Conexant Systems for $341 million and Marvell Technology Group's Multimedia Solutions unit for $95 million.[7]
Technology[edit]
Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology, as opposed to resistive touchscreen technologies. Capacitive touch sensing works by sensing the electrical properties of the finger(s) touching the sensor; a resistive touchscreen senses direct pressure between two clear electrical layers that are separated by a small space, requiring an amount of force.[8] Capacitive touch sensing solutions are solid state, making them more robust than resistive solutions.
Synaptics's human interface solutions are currently based upon the following key technologies:


Capacitive active pen
Capacitive force sensing
Capacitive position sensing
Display systems and circuit
Fingerprint sensing
Mixed-signal integrated circuit
Multi-touch
Pattern recognition
Proprietary microcontroller
ThinTouch
Transparent capacitive position sensing

History[edit]
Synaptics was founded in 1986 by scientists and engineers Federico Faggin and Carver Mead, inspired by their interest in neural networks and their applications in technologies. Faggin and Mead applied their research and discoveries on neural networks and transistors on chips to build touch sensing solutions. The name of the company was derived from this combination, blending synapse and electronics.
During Synaptics' early years, the laptop industry was struggling to make devices thinner because the spherical trackballs included in them required thicker device builds. Synaptics' founders recognized this issue and in 1992, used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world's first touchpad,[3] which Apple adopted in 1995. The touchpad was subsequently adopted by other leading computer manufacturers of the time, including Compaq and Dell, launching Synaptics' growth as a company and establishing touchpads as a standard feature in notebook PCs. As integration of the touchpad grew, Synaptics continued to refine its technology, building a vision to integrate it with other solutions and create a range of human interface technologies to expand the company.
Since then, Synaptics' solutions have been adopted in various markets beyond notebook computers. In 2005, Synaptics' sensor technology was featured in the world's first mobile phone to use capacitive-touch technology, the Samsung B310. In 2007, LG launched its Prada phone featuring Synaptics' touch sensors, marking the world's first capacitive-touchscreen mobile phone. Synaptics' touchscreen technology was also featured in Logitech's Harmony family, which debuted in 2008 and brought capacitive-touch capabilities to universal remote controls.
In 2011, current CEO Rick Bergman was appointed to succeed Francis Lee (CEO from 1999-2011) and drive Synaptics' expansion in to new markets.
In 2012, Synaptics introduced the world's first full-function capacitive-touch solution to incorporate pressure recognition (AKA force sensing), enabling multi-finger and variable-force input. The following year, Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors, a fingerprint sensor vendor based in San Jose, adding biometrics and fingerprint sensing to Synaptics' portfolio of solutions.[4]
Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc., a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays, in 2014. Synaptics purchased Renesas SP for approximately JPY48.5B ($475 million) for 100% of the company.[5] The acquisition enabled Synaptics to establish an integrated portfolio of touch and display driver technologies.
The company has since expanded in to additional markets including automotive, wearables and PC peripherals in 2015. Synaptics in 2015 had 1600+ granted and pending patents for human interface solutions.[6] In FY15, Synaptics reported $1.703 billion in revenue and cited a +46% compound annual growth rate.[6]
In June 2017 Synaptics announced it was acquiring Conexant Systems for $341 million and Marvell Technology Group's Multimedia Solutions unit for $95 million.[7]
Technology[edit]
Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology, as opposed to resistive touchscreen technologies. Capacitive touch sensing works by sensing the electrical properties of the finger(s) touching the sensor; a resistive touchscreen senses direct pressure between two clear electrical layers that are separated by a small space, requiring an amount of force.[8] Capacitive touch sensing solutions are solid state, making them more robust than resistive solutions.
Synaptics's human interface solutions are currently based upon the following key technologies:


Capacitive active pen
Capacitive force sensing
Capacitive position sensing
Display systems and circuit
Fingerprint sensing
Mixed-signal integrated circuit
Multi-touch
Pattern recognition
Proprietary microcontroller
ThinTouch
Transparent capacitive position sensing

Synaptics touchpad


Synaptics' core product families deliver touch sensing, display and biometrics solutions. They include touchpads, touch controllers, fingerprint sensors and integrated solutions.
TouchPad Family[9] - touch-sensitive trackpads that sense the position and movement of one or more fingers on their surfaces. the TouchPad's core market is notebook PCs and includes:

TouchPad- Module enabling user navigation via touch interface
ClickPad- "Clickable TouchPad" that also serves as a button
ForcePad- TouchPad with pressure-sensitive scrolling and zooming, and press-to-click capabilities anywhere on the TouchPad
SecurePad- TouchPad with fingerprint authentication enabling users to authorize online transactions, login to websites and access applications

ClearPad Touch Controllers[10] - Capacitive-touch controllers with minimal size and low power requirements, tailored for specific applications:

Series 1 - for compact displays
Series 2 - for smartphone touchscreens
Series 3 - for more feature-rich mobile device displays
Series 7 - for tablet, PC, notebook, automotive and other applications requiring larger touchscreens

Natural ID Fingerprint Sensors (Biometrics)[11] - Series of fingerprint authentication sensors, combining biometrics and advanced encryption with security, ease of use and cost efficiency. They feature Synaptics' SentryPoint, which is a suite of security features aggregated to protect users' personal biometric information. Natural ID sensors also function under glass, making it possible to eliminate the home button on smartphones.
ClearView Display Drivers[12] - Display driver integrated circuits (DDIC) with the industry's smallest display ICs and ultra-HD resolution support for more dynamic, design friendly and power-efficient display options, as well as reduced image-load times.
TouchView Integrated Touch and Display Controllers[13] - Solutions integrating touch and display technology in to single and two-chip solutions enabling devices to be thinner and lighter at lower costs. Synaptics touch and display driver integration (TDDI) supports ClearForce for variable force sensing, and ClearView DDIC features for enhancing display brightness, color, contrast and readability in sunlight, and power efficiency. For advanced touch features, TouchView products support virtually all ClearPad touch controller features.
Industry alliances[edit]
Synaptics is a founding member of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance and the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI).
The FIDO Alliance is an industry consortium that aims to make authentication stronger and simpler, and to reduce reliance on passwords.[14] Synaptics' Corporate Development Vice President, Adnan Raza, sits on the FIDO Alliance board, representing Synaptics. Other notable Board Members include Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Lenovo, Qualcomm, RSA, Samsung, Bank of America, Visa, Discover, American Express and MasterCard.
USI is an organization of leading OEMs, stylus and touch controller manufacturers driving industry standards to promote interoperable active styluses with touch-enabled devices such as phones, tablets and computing and entertainment platforms. Synaptics' Senior Director of Integrated Display and Touch Products, Jeff Lukanc, is Vice President of USI.
Manufacturing & supply chain[edit]
Synaptics' manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which it outsource all of its production requirements and generally drop ship its products directly to its customers from its contract manufacturers’ facilities. This eliminates the need for significant capital expenditures and allows the company to minimize its investment in inventories.
The company provides its contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. It uses two third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and four third-party packaging manufacturers to package its proprietary ASICs.
In certain cases, it relies on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of its products.[15]

Synaptics stock price target raised to $77 from $72 at J.P. Morgan

Apple supplier Synaptics to buy audio software company, enters deal with Marvell
Shares of Synaptics Inc.  fell 3% late Monday after the Apple Inc.  supplier announced two deals and tweaked its fourth-quarter sales guidance. Synaptics said it had agreed to buy voice and audio processing software company Conexant Systems for $300 million in a cash and stock deal, and that it had entered an agreement with Marvell Technology Group  to buy Marvell's multimedia business for $95 million, all cash. That combination "will immediately jumpstart (Synaptics) presence in the smart home market," and are part of a long-term strategy "to extend the company's human interface leadership into the consumer (Internet of Things) era," the company said in a statement. Synaptics also said that it expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $420 million to $430 million, slightly below the midpoint of a previously expected range of $410 million to $450 million. The stock ended the regular session down 1.5%.

Faggin and Mead applied their research and discoveries on neural networks and transistors on chips to build touch sensing solutions. The name of the company was derived from this combination, blending synapse and electronics.
During Synaptics' early years, the laptop industry was struggling to make devices thinner because the spherical trackballs included in them required thicker device builds. Synaptics' founders recognized this issue and in 1992, used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world's first touchpad,[3] which Apple adopted in 1995. The touchpad was subsequently adopted by other leading computer manufacturers of the time, including Compaq and Dell, launching Synaptics' growth as a company and establishing touchpads as a standard feature in notebook PCs. As integration of the touchpad grew, Synaptics continued to refine its technology, building a vision to integrate it with other solutions and create a range of human interface technologies to expand the company.
Since then, Synaptics' solutions have been adopted in various markets beyond notebook computers. In 2005, Synaptics' sensor technology was featured in the world's first mobile phone to use capacitive-touch technology, the Samsung B310. In 2007, LG launched its Prada phone featuring Synaptics' touch sensors, marking the world's first capacitive-touchscreen mobile phone. Synaptics' touchscreen technology was also featured in Logitech's Harmony family, which debuted in 2008 and brought capacitive-touch capabilities to universal remote controls.
In 2011, current CEO Rick Bergman was appointed to succeed Francis Lee (CEO from 1999-2011) and drive Synaptics' expansion in to new markets.
In 2012, Synaptics introduced the world's first full-function capacitive-touch solution to incorporate pressure recognition (AKA force sensing), enabling multi-finger and variable-force input. The following year, Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors, a fingerprint sensor vendor based in San Jose, adding biometrics and fingerprint sensing to Synaptics' portfolio of solutions.[4]
Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc., a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays, in 2014. Synaptics purchased Renesas SP for approximately JPY48.5B ($475 million) for 100% of the company.[5] The acquisition enabled Synaptics to establish an integrated portfolio of touch and display driver technologies.
The company has since expanded in to additional markets including automotive, wearables and PC peripherals in 2015. Synaptics in 2015 had 1600+ granted and pending patents for human interface solutions.[6] In FY15, Synaptics reported $1.703 billion in revenue and cited a +46% compound annual growth rate.[6]
In June 2017 Synaptics announced it was acquiring Conexant Systems for $341 million and Marvell Technology Group's Multimedia Solutions unit for $95 million.[7]
Technology[edit]
Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology, as opposed to resistive touchscreen technologies. Capacitive touch sensing works by sensing the electrical properties of the finger(s) touching the sensor; a resistive touchscreen senses direct pressure between two clear electrical layers that are separated by a small space, requiring an amount of force.[8] Capacitive touch sensing solutions are solid state, making them more robust than resistive solutions.
Synaptics's human interface solutions are currently based upon the following key technologies:


Capacitive active pen
Capacitive force sensing
Capacitive position sensing
Display systems and circuit
Fingerprint sensing
Mixed-signal integrated circuit
Multi-touch
Pattern recognition
Proprietary microcontroller

Synaptics touchpad


Synaptics' core product families deliver touch sensing, display and biometrics solutions. They include touchpads, touch controllers, fingerprint sensors and integrated solutions.
TouchPad Family[9] - touch-sensitive trackpads that sense the position and movement of one or more fingers on their surfaces. the TouchPad's core market is notebook PCs and includes:

TouchPad- Module enabling user navigation via touch interface
ClickPad- "Clickable TouchPad" that also serves as a button
ForcePad- TouchPad with pressure-sensitive scrolling and zooming, and press-to-click capabilities anywhere on the TouchPad
SecurePad- TouchPad with fingerprint authentication enabling users to authorize online transactions, login to websites and access applications

ClearPad Touch Controllers[10] - Capacitive-touch controllers with minimal size and low power requirements, tailored for specific applications:

Series 1 - for compact displays
Series 2 - for smartphone touchscreens
Series 3 - for more feature-rich mobile device displays
Series 7 - for tablet, PC, notebook, automotive and other applications requiring larger touchscreens

Natural ID Fingerprint Sensors (Biometrics)[11] - Series of fingerprint authentication sensors, combining biometrics and advanced encryption with security, ease of use and cost efficiency. They feature Synaptics' SentryPoint, which is a suite of security features aggregated to protect users' personal biometric information. Natural ID sensors also function under glass, making it possible to eliminate the home button on smartphones.
ClearView Display Drivers[12] - Display driver integrated circuits (DDIC) with the industry's smallest display ICs and ultra-HD resolution support for more dynamic, design friendly and power-efficient display options, as well as reduced image-load times.
TouchView Integrated Touch and Display Controllers[13] - Solutions integrating touch and display technology in to single and two-chip solutions enabling devices to be thinner and lighter at lower costs. Synaptics touch and display driver integration (TDDI) supports ClearForce for variable force sensing, and ClearView DDIC features for enhancing display brightness, color, contrast and readability in sunlight, and power efficiency. For advanced touch features, TouchView products support virtually all ClearPad touch controller features.
Industry alliances[edit]
Synaptics is a founding member of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance and the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI).
The FIDO Alliance is an industry consortium that aims to make authentication stronger and simpler, and to reduce reliance on passwords.[14] Synaptics' Corporate Development Vice President, Adnan Raza, sits on the FIDO Alliance board, representing Synaptics. Other notable Board Members include Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Lenovo, Qualcomm, RSA, Samsung, Bank of America, Visa, Discover, American Express and MasterCard.
USI is an organization of leading OEMs, stylus and touch controller manufacturers driving industry standards to promote interoperable active styluses with touch-enabled devices such as phones, tablets and computing and entertainment platforms. Synaptics' Senior Director of Integrated Display and Touch Products, Jeff Lukanc, is Vice President of USI.
Manufacturing & supply chain[edit]
Synaptics' manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which it outsource all of its production requirements and generally drop ship its products directly to its customers from its contract manufacturers’ facilities. This eliminates the need for significant capital expenditures and allows the company to minimize its investment in inventories.
The company provides its contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. It uses two third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and four third-party packaging manufacturers to package its proprietary ASICs.
In certain cases, it relies on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of its products.[15]

History[edit]
Synaptics was founded in 1986 by scientists and engineers Federico Faggin and Carver Mead, inspired by their interest in neural networks and their applications in technologies. Faggin and Mead applied their research and discoveries on neural networks and transistors on chips to build touch sensing solutions. The name of the company was derived from this combination, blending synapse and electronics.
During Synaptics' early years, the laptop industry was struggling to make devices thinner because the spherical trackballs included in them required thicker device builds.

Synaptics stock price target raised to $77 from $72 at J.P. Morgan
Synaptics stock price target raised to $77 from $72 at J.P. Morgan

Apple supplier Synaptics to buy audio software company, enters deal with Marvell
Shares of Synaptics Inc.  fell 3% late Monday after the Apple Inc.  supplier announced two deals and tweaked its fourth-quarter sales guidance. Synaptics said it had agreed to buy voice and audio processing software company Conexant Systems for $300 million in a cash and stock deal, and that it had entered an agreement with Marvell Technology Group  to buy Marvell's multimedia business for $95 million, all cash. That combination "will immediately jumpstart (Synaptics) presence in the smart home market," and are part of a long-term strategy "to extend the company's human interface leadership into the consumer (Internet of Things) era," the company said in a statement. Synaptics also said that it expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $420 million to $430 million, slightly below the midpoint of a previously expected range of $410 million to $450 million. The stock ended the regular session down 1.5%.

THE POWER OF TOUCH






Home  Overview  Touch Controllers 



ClearPad® Touch Controllers
What’s more natural than the human touch? ClearPad solutions from Synaptics bring that human touch to a new dimension by dramatically enhancing users' interaction with smartphones, tablets, PC notebooks, wearables, and other devices. The extensive ClearPad line is a family of capacitive-touch controllers tailored for specific applications -- Series 1 for compact displays; Series 2 enabling smartphone touchscreens; Series 3 for more feature-rich mobile device displays; and Series 7 made for tablet, PC notebook, automotive and other applications requiring larger touchscreens.  The controllers' minimal size, low power requirements and array of other key innovations enable manufacturers to differentiate their products significantly.


Features & Benefits 
   ClearForce ClearForce enables ClearPad with a new dimension in user interfaces, with features such as scrolling, zoom, gaming, and text or photo editing by applying variable force with a finger or stylus.   SideTouch™ SideTouch gives smartphone users an entirely new way to scroll and take photos -- through controls built into the side of the devices.   Glove ClearPad controllers' sensitivity allows touch gestures on a display even when users are wearing gloves.   Moisture Functionality Damp or oily fingers are no match for ClearPad's ability to function even in moist conditions.   User-Defined Gestures Users can create their own shortcuts and customized gestures to unlock their phones, launch apps, and more.   Proximity/Hover Sensors can be triggered through close proximity -- even without users touching the screen.   Multi-Function Pen ClearPad multi-function-pen support enables precision writing and drawing through powered styluses.   FaceDetect™ FaceDetect distinguishes between a user’s finger and face, protecting against unintended gestures on a smartphone’s display.   Passive Pen Non-battery-powered styluses also are supported by ClearPad, enabling the use of less-expensive alternatives.   Ultra Compact A small die size and ultra-low power make ClearPad ideal for applications on wearable devices such as a smart watch.   Certified for Automotive ClearPad touch controllers are certified for demanding automotive applications the user larger displays.   Ideal for Wearables ClearPad touch controllers make wearables compact, feature-rich and power-efficient.

  Design Studio™ StreamlinesTouchscreen DesignClearPad touch controllers are fully supported by Synaptics Design Studio, which delivers a comprehensive, start-to-finish array of tools to simplify the design of touchscreens and bring them to market faster.Read MoreSynaptics Design Studio streamlines the touchscreen design process, while reducing total design cost and accelerating the time to market. The tool suite assists designers in creating optimal products that are tightly aligned with target design and performance specifications. Design Studio works seamlessly with multiple display configurations and stack-ups, including discrete sensor, on-glass-sensor, on-cell, and in-cell solutions.
Design Studio includes tuning and configuration wizards, production test tools, and diagnostics tools that configure and test chips and modules built using Synaptics capacitive sensing technology. Choice of materials, thickness of glass, and system architecture impact touch performance. Synaptics Design Studio allows designers to set firmware parameters (such as baseline capacitance and operating frequency) to optimize the touch performance of a particular touchscreen design. The result is excellent responsiveness, sensitivity and finger-tracking. The tools also allow the designer to enable and configure advanced features such as side touch, moisture tolerance, and gesture recognition.
For integrated touch and display controllers, Design Studio also allows designers to adjust color settings -- gamma, warmth, white point, color targets, backlight intensity -- to optimize and tailor the display performance of a particular design.  The result: Vibrant images, excellent color and low power consumption.
