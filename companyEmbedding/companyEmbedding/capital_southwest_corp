Capital Southwest Corporation Acquires Strathmore Products, Inc.
Establishes Presence and Platform for Growth in the Industrial Coatings Sector

DALLAS, April 29, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Southwest Corporation ("Capital Southwest") (Nasdaq:CSWC) today announced that its affiliate, The Whitmore Manufacturing Company ("Whitmore"), a leading Rockwall, Texas-based provider of innovative products and services which increase the reliability, productivity and lifespan of mission critical operating equipment, has acquired substantially all of the assets of Strathmore Products, Inc. ("Strathmore" or the "Company"), based in Syracuse, New York. Strathmore is a leading manufacturer of industrial coatings with manufacturing facilities in Syracuse and Longview, Texas.

	"With the acquisition of Strathmore, we now have a meaningful market presence in the industrial coatings sector and a platform from which to grow through end-market and geographic expansion as well as through the execution of strategic acquisitions," said Joseph B. Armes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capital Southwest. "This acquisition will support and strengthen our previously announced spin-off of certain Capital Southwest control assets into its own diversified industrial growth company."

	In December 2014, Capital Southwest announced its intention to spin-off certain of its control assets, including Whitmore, which has been a portfolio company of the Company since 1971, to form a publicly traded, diversified industrial growth company. The spin-off is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter of 2015.

	"Strathmore will be joining Whitmore, RectorSeal, Jet-Lube and several other affiliated companies in the Capital Southwest family," said Christopher J. Mudd, Senior Vice President of Capital Southwest. "Each of these companies are leaders in their respective market segments and share a common history of providing high-quality products to help their customers optimize their performance and become more successful. The fit of Strathmore into our portfolio could not be better."

	"This transaction is a clear endorsement of the growth and success Strathmore has achieved," added William M. Udovich, Strathmore president. We are very excited to have the opportunity to become part of Capital Southwest and believe its philosophy of supporting long-term investments in assets and employees will enhance our ability to compete in the marketplace and execute our growth strategies. Such a long-term commitment is critical to delivering market-leading products for our customers."

	"The acquisition of Strathmore is an example of the opportunities we see for creating a standalone industrials business focused on generating free cash flow through organic and acquisition-based growth. We continue to assess strategic acquisitions that either build-out existing industry verticals or provide an entry into new, complementary industry verticals where we can enhance performance and create value," concluded Mr. Armes.

	Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.About Capital Southwest

	Capital Southwest Corporation (Nasdaq:CSWC) is a Dallas, Texas-based publicly traded business development company, with approximately $750 million in assets. On December 2, 2014, Capital Southwest announced its intent to separate into two public companies through the spinoff of certain of its control assets into a diversified industrial growth company and the refocus of the BDC on lending to strong middle market companies. As a result, our new investment activity is focused on senior "unitranche" debt, subordinated debt and equity co-investments to support the acquisition and growth of middle market companies. Our control companies are actively seeking growth through add-on acquisitions. Since Capital Southwest was formed in 1961, we have always sought to invest in companies with strong management teams and sound financial performance. As a public company, we are fortunate to have the 
flexibility to be creative in our financing structures and to invest to support the growth of our portfolio companies over long periods of time.About Whitmore

	Established in 1893, The Whitmore Manufacturing Company is a global leader in providing innovative products and services that increase the reliability, productivity and lifespan of mission critical operating equipment. We manufacture reliability products, high performance lubricants, friction modifiers, rail lubrication equipment, lubrication management systems, coatings, sealants and cleaners designed to meet the specific needs of each industry and application. Customers worldwide rely on Whitmore to deliver the custom engineered solutions industry counts on for the most adverse conditions and demanding environments.

Investment Strategy

Investment Criteria

Investment Strategy 


Approach We take a balanced approach to all investment decisions, which reinforces the long-term relationships we enjoy with financial sponsors, investment banks, other lenders and company management teams. 

Relationships drive our business
Relationships are the key driver of our business. We consider what is best for our long-term relationship in every decision we make.


We are highly responsive
We believe that a quick “no”, with constructive feedback is always better than a drawn-out, unnecessary process. Our team constantly communicates with one another, which allows us to respond quickly to investment opportunities.


We deliver on our promises
We will clearly communicate what we are willing to do and deliver on our promises.                Our tight-knit organization allows for senior deal professionals to continually communicate with one another and “speak for the firm” throughout the transaction. We believe this provides a more predictable diligence, approval and closing process.


We are creative and flexible
Our team has invested together across credit cycles and understands the nuances of middle market companies. We have the mandate to invest senior debt, subordinated debt or equity – or combinations of the three – in each transaction, to meet the unique objectives of the company, and fairly price the underlying risk.


We always have capital to invest
As a public company, we enjoy a permanent capital base and are never "between funds." We are therefore able to provide capital for growth and acquisitions over very long periods of time. We believe our best opportunities are ones in which we can support company management teams in industries in which we have gained a track record of value creation and back them in significantly scaling their businesses.

            Dallas-based Capital Southwest Corp. plans to spin off some specialty manufacturing operations that it controls into a standalone, publicly traded firm, the company said today before the markets opened.The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of September 2015.Joe Armes, chairman and CEO of Capital Southwest, said in a statement that shortly after he joined the company last year he concluded that it operated two different business models “within a corporate and regulatory structure that is ideal for neither.”The result, Armes said, is that Capital Southwest stock trades at a “significant discount” to net asset value.One business model is an industrial growth company, Armes said. The other is an equity investment company.The industrial spin-off, to be named later, will include the RectorSeal Corp., the Whitmore Manufacturing Co. and Jet-Lube Inc.RectorSeal makes specialty chemical products and control devices used for plumbing, heating and air conditioning, electrical and industrial applications. Whitmore and JetLube make specialty lubricants.The combined operations generated revenue of nearly $220 million in the 12 months ended in March, Capital Southwest said.“We believe this transaction is the best way to eliminate the market discount to NAV by separating these business models,” Armes said.In its most recent earnings filing, for the period ended Sept. 30, Capital Southwest reported an NAV per share of $48.79. The company's stock closed Monday at $36.85.Early reaction today from investors was positive. Capital Southwest shares moved up about 10 percent at the opening."This is something that should have been done years ago," analyst John Deysher of Pinnacle said in a conference call with Capital Southwest executives.In the call, Armes said that that industrial company would have "zero net debt" initially after the spinoff.Bowen Diehl, chief investment officer for the company, said a refocused Capital Southwest would have roughly between $200 million and $250 million in assets, much of it in cash, after the spinoff.With leverage, he said, "we see a path to $500 million to invest."Capital Southwest will remain a regulated investment company and will invest primarily in debt securities, and may also invest in preferred and common stock alongside the debt.Prior to joining Capital Southwest, Armes ran a family investment firm and was a key executive with Hicks Holdings and Hicks Sports Group, controlled by Tom Hicks, the former owner of the Texas Rangers.Armes will remain chairman of Capital Southwest after the spinoff and become chairman and CEO of the new industrial company. Diehl is expected to become CEO of Capital Southwest.

Capital Southwest Announces First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release And Conference Call Schedule






Cash Dividend On The Way From Capital Southwest (CSWC)













This Stock Has A 5.21% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
