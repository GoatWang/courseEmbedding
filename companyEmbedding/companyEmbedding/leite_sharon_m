Women Leaders:  A Visit with Sharon Leite, President of Sally Beauty U.S. and Canada

Women Leaders Series
An Interview with
Sharon M. Leite
President, Sally Beauty
Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.
********
Sharon, let’s start at the beginning.  Where were you born?
I was born in Madison Wisconsin, however I only lived there for two weeks. My dad was a graduate of the Naval Academy and we were stationed there, however two weeks after I was born we moved to Great Falls, Montana.
Do you have any siblings?
I have two siblings both are younger than I am. My brother Michael lives in Boston, Massachusetts and my brother Eric lives in Tampa. Florida.
What was your childhood like growing up?
After my dad’s time in the military, my parents moved us back to their hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. We lived in the suburbs of Cleveland until I was a freshman in high school. During my freshman year of high school, we moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. As I look back on my childhood, I was very fortunate to have parents that supported anything I aspired to do or to be. As well as a home filled with lots of love, friends and family.
Where did you go to college?
I attended three colleges, Loyola University, Kent State and Delgado College.  Post college I am a lifelong learner. I am involved in several trade organizations, universities and enjoy reading.
Tell us how you chose your career path in retail.
I stumbled into retail, believe it or not, by answering an ad in the newspaper. That should give you an idea about how old I am! 🙂 It was an ad to be an assistant manager in a women’s clothing store. I thought it would be fun! And it was!
I was hooked! I loved helping the customer, by helping her with an outfit for a special moment in her life, and just helping to make her feel good.  I also enjoyed being a shopkeeper. Presenting the merchandise in the windows, in the store, creating outfits, it was my creative outlet. During that time I also fell in love with leading people and developing teams.
Sally Beauty is North America’s largest specialty retailer of professional beauty products.   As the new President of the U.S. and Canadian markets, what are your first priorities for the brand?
My first priority at Sally beauty was to define who we are in the marketplace.  We have over 3200 stores in the United States and Canada. From my view we are a specialty retailer, however my team at Sally beauty had never really thought of themselves in that way. How you go to market as a specialty retailer is different than being a mass merchant.  In tandem with that we had to define our brand story – we have a rich history at Sally Beauty, we’ve been around for over 50 years. 
However, the organization had never thought of themselves as a brand. So we defined our brand story.   However to define that brand story, we needed to know who our customer was.  Who is she? Why does she shop with us?  What does she buy from us? All of these things and many more had to be determined through research and customer data.  And of course whenever you work in an organization getting to know the people and understanding the culture of the organization is a top priority.
Who is the Sally Beauty customer?
Our customer is a resourceful beauty enthusiast. She is someone who loves the beauty category, she’s a trend seeker, a Do It Yourself Diva and loves to experiment.  Many of our customers shop in what we call mass merchandising stores like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Target.  Our brand positioning is a trade up from mass. Our customer is a woman who works hard, she’s raising a family, often by herself, or she’s taking care of others. Many of our customers have multiple jobs. My desire for us at Sally Beauty is to empower her to find her beautiful, however and whatever that means to her, in other words, how she defines her beautiful. 
How is today’s consumer different from say ten years ago?
The customer today has a lot more information at their fingertips.  The movement to Omni channel and the ability for the customer to shop when, where and how she wants has definitely changed the retail landscape. No longer does she need to go to a “store” to get what she wants. She can shop from the convenience of her mobile device. And most customers today, start their shopping journey there. In addition, due to the many shipping options available, she can often get what she wants without leaving her home and in some locations, literally get something delivered to her in less than two hours. 
With the explosion of online retail sales, what is your strategy in terms of balancing your market efforts online with your brick and mortar stores?
As we think about the future, for Sally Beauty to be able to compete in an integrated commerce world, we have to shift our strategy and invest in digital and the online experience. We are in the process of putting together an extensive roadmap that allows us to play in this very important space. Part of the strategy is also developing key partnerships to aid us on this journey.  For us, playing local with all of our stores, is also an important part of our strategy.
What are critical elements in developing (and sustaining) an iconic brand?
To be a great brand, your customer has to know what you stand for. First of all, are you passionate about customers?   What products do you offer that are unique and special?  How do you differentiate yourself in the marketplace?  Do you deliver your brand consistently across all customer touch points?  Do you have brand ambassadors in your organization that can deliver on your Brand promise? These would be my top characteristics of a great brand.
What is Sally Beauty’s differentiator from its’ competition?
Sally differentiates its place in the market by developing and delivering pro quality products at a value, and providing advice and solutions to help her feel beautiful however she defines it.  And with everything we do, we back it up with a love it or return it guarantee. We believe, that beauty is for everyone, especially you.
What is the best piece of professional advice you have received?
The best piece of professional advice I’ve ever received came from my dad.  My parents have incredibly strong work ethics. I remember sitting at the kitchen table and having a conversation with him when I was in middle school…we were talking about how hard he worked and how he had continued to find success in his professional life, and I remember him telling me like it was yesterday that “you have to work hard in life to get what you want in this life Sharon, and if you don’t give it your all, then just don’t bother.” In my life, especially in my professional life, I’ve always tried to heed that advice.
Who are some professional heroes?
I have several professional heroes, the first two that come to mind are Cynthia Harriss and Cynthia Peter who I worked for at the Walt Disney Company and Alex Smith who I worked for at Pier 1 Imports.  These 3 leaders were exceptional teachers.  I learned not only the skills to be more effective in my job, but they were instrumental in shaping “how” I do my job.  Many of the leadership skills I have today I learned from them.  
Two other professional heroes I learned so much from was Les Wexner, CEO of L brands, and Mickey Drexler who was the CEO of GAP Inc. Both men are legendary merchants when it comes to knowing what the customer wants.  They’ve been innovators and taken appropriate risks to help make the businesses they lead successful. I learned much from both of these leaders while working for the companies they lead or led.
Personal heroes?
Personal heroes are definitely my parents. I can’t think of two people better to look up to and to model my life after. They are two absolutely amazing people.
You have held C-suite positions for many years now.  What do you attribute your business success to?
I attribute the business success I’ve had in my career to the talent in the organization.  You can’t be successful without the “right” people.  Not to mention, having the right team makes the work environment so much more enjoyable!  It makes getting through the tough times easier and the celebratory times that much sweeter!  In my view, it all starts with the people.
What is the part about your job you love the most?
The part of the job that I love the most is seeing people succeed and teams win! There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing someone get promoted or someone accomplish a milestone.  I love seeing people and/or teams succeed at something they may have thought wasn’t possible.
Can you leave us with your favorite quote?
I have several. 
“A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.” John C. Maxwell
“Be a yardstick of quality.  Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.” Steve Jobs
“Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.” John F. Kennedy
“There are two kinds of people, those who do the work and those who take the credit.  Try to the first group; there is competition there.” Indira Gandhi
“Good is the enemy of Great.” Jim Collins
“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” Maya Angelou
Thank you Sharon for spending time with us.
