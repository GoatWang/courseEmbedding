Anthony L. Leggio is a Bakersfield native. He attended the University of the Pacific where he graduated Summa Cum Laude. After graduating With Distinction from McGeorge School of Law in 1977, he returned home to Bakersfield where the Leggio family has long had deep roots in the business community since the 1940’s.
Upon joining the firm in 1977, Mr. Leggio was instrumental in developing the firm’s business practice. From 1977 to 2001, the business practice of the firm under Mr. Leggio’s direction grew steadily in diversification and expertise to meet the ever-expanding needs of its clients.
While Mr. Leggio’s practice over the past thirty years has included a broad range of business transactional matters, he developed a reputation as a practical and astute business planner and corporate counsel. He served as counsel to numerous large businesses in both legal and business strategic planning and has handled many complex purchase and sales of businesses. His broad range of legal and business experience makes him uniquely qualified to assist businesses in navigating difficult issues.
In 2001, Mr. Leggio joined long-time client, Bolthouse Farms, Inc. as Vice-President/General Counsel. Mr. Leggio was involved with Bolthouse Farms’ sale to a private equity firm in 2005.
As Of Counsel to the firm, he continues to be available to the firm, and its clients, in strategic business planning. In addition, he serves on the Board of many private businesses due to his unique combination of legal and business expertise.
