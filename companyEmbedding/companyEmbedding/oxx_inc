About OXX 





What We Stand For
OXX® builds premium products for people who work and play outside, the World’s Toughest in fact. Every design element and every engineering build, we pushed beyond what you’d expect in a coffee maker. The COFFEEBOXX™ was created to be another tool in your arsenal. We want you to take it everywhere you go. It provides the fuel you need.










Our Inspiration
The COFFEEBOXX was born of an epiphany. While designing appliances that go inside the house, the founder of OXX took note of all the appliances carried in and off job sites each day. Those who literally build our modern day society and provide us with the shelter for the rest of us to live and work, bring their breakroom with them each day. This needed to change, and so OXX was forged.








Beyond Rugged™
The builder was our North Star. The COFFEEBOXX is engineered with a crush-proof body, made with the impact-resistant materials you’d often find in tools that take a beating. We reinforced walls, sealed up components and made the water tank spill-proof. You’re on the go and there’s no time for sticky buttons or splashing water.
Speaking of go, the COFFEEBOXX is built with six external stainless steel tie downs, a retractable cord and a rubberized handle. Now it’s easy to have hot coffee when and where you want it. Hit the power button and you can have a hot cup of joe in less than 90 seconds. Durable and low maintenance, all you have to do is clean it on occasion.
If the COFFEEBOXX is tough enough for work, there’s no doubt that it’s ready for camping, hunting, boating, tailgating, RVing… just name the adventure.








“If coffee is the nectar of the gods, then this is Thor’s coffeemaker.”


“Introducing the world’s toughest coffee maker for rugged caffeinators.”


“It’s hard to beat the convenience of K-Cup coffee packs – but they’re limited to at home use. Until now.”

FAQ 






Have A Question?
Well, we have answers. Scroll through our list of FAQs to get the info you need. If you can’t find it here, head over to the Contact page to send a message with your inquiry.








Making Coffee

Why did you make the COFFEEBOXX just single serve?
Our single serve COFFEEBOXX lets you brew a hot, fresh cup of coffee (8 oz., 10 oz. or 12 oz.) whenever you want one. No need to drink a whole pot quickly before it gets stale, or pour a pot of coffee into an insulated vacuum bottle that’ll only keep it hot for so long. With single serve brewing, when you’re ready for your next cup, you just make one. Single serve coffee pods are also perfect for brewing coffee on the go. They are sealed, self-contained filtering units and the ground coffee inside each pod is fresh; unlike the bags or cans of pre-ground coffee where you use a few scoops at a time as the rest loses freshness. Bottom line: single serve means a perfect cuppa with less waste.
I like the single serve idea but don’t like using disposable pods. Is there an alternative?
Yes, there are a number of reusable pods that you can refill with your favorite pre-ground coffee. We’ve found the EcoFill™ brand to be reliable. You can find it in our shop.
Can you make tea and other non-coffee based drinks and food?
The COFFEEBOXX features a unique, dedicated hot water line. This means no coffee ground residue in your tea or ramen. Select the water button on the control panel to get hot, fresh water. Pop a teabag, hot cocoa mix, or a pack of noodles directly into a cup to get your preferred fix.
How many cups of coffee do you get out of one tank of water?
You will get up to 10 cups of coffee in one tank (84.5 oz) of water if you choose the 8 oz. setting each time.
What size cup can I use in the COFFEEBOXX?
The COFFEEBOXX has a roomy area to fit large cups, insulated mugs and some thermoses. With the drip tray, it can accommodate a 7” tall cup. By removing the drip tray, it can accommodate an 8” tall cup. The area is 4” wide.
Is there a built-in water filter?
There is a replaceable water filter in the top of the water tank reservoir.
Do I need to use filtered water or can I get it from the tap?
The COFFEEBOXX uses a charcoal filter, so water from the tap works great. The filter removes contaminants and impurities; but don’t go filling the water tank from a pond or stream – that needs a different type of filtration.
Does the COFFEEBOXX work with all brands of coffee pods?
The COFFEEBOXX works with all K-Cup® compatible single serve coffee pods.*









Product Specs

How much does it weigh?
The COFFEEBOXX weighs 12 lbs when it the water tank is empty.
What are the dimensions of the COFFEEBOXX?
It is 11″L x 9″W x 11.5″H



Power

Why didn’t you make the COFFEEBOXX with a battery?
It takes a lot of power to make good, hot coffee so unfortunately the batteries we’ve come to know and love just don’t have the strength to do the trick (well, a car battery will work). The COFFEEBOXX pulls down 1450W so we recommend at least a 1800W inverter if you go that route – but be sure to consult the manufacturer of the alternate power source before using the COFFEEBOXX to make sure the power source is connected correctly and can safely supply the required power.
What are the specs on power?
The COFFEEBOXX is a 120v AC, 1450W appliance.














Maintenance and Coverage

What kind of maintenance and cleaning should I do to keep the COFFEEBOXX running its best?
Just like changing the oil in your car and your furnace filter in your house, regular maintenance can go a long way. Be sure to clean the brewing compartment, drip tray and water tank regularly. Also, we recommend descaling every three months. Descaling removes calcium deposits that can build up like they do on any coffeemaker. See instructions in the owner’s manual (Link To Manual) on how to use vinegar and the proper steps. The COFFEEBOXX will remind you when it’s time. Descaling helps to ensure the best performance of your machine as well as the best tasting coffee.
Can I leave the COFFEEBOXX out in freezing temperatures?
We all know what happens when things freeze and it’s not pretty. Always store the COFFEEBOXX in a dry, controlled environment. Empty the Water Tank and allow it to completely air dry prior to storage. Follow the directions for flushing the machine on page 13 of the User Guide..
What does the one-year warranty cover?
It warrants that your OXX appliance will be free of defects in materials or workmanship under normal use for one year from the date of purchase. We will repair or replace (based on our review) the OXX appliance without charge upon its receipt of proof of purchase. This does not cover consequential or incidental damages such as property damage. See full warranty info in the User Guide.



Accessories

Can I get extra water tanks?
Yes, you can purchase water tanks in our shop.
Is there a compartment to hold the coffee pods, etc?
There is not a place in the COFFEEBOXX to hold coffee pods, however this is a case designed just for the COFFEEBOXX and its accessories. The case is designed to allow its use within the case. Unzip a panel to lower the drip tray and another to access the control panel. Additional compartments hold coffee pods, sugar, creamer, stirs, etc. You can find this awesome case in our shop.
Does the COFFEEBOXX come in other colors?
Yes, you can purchase the Limited Edition COFFEEBOXX in black in our shop.
Can I get a custom COFFEEBOXX with my name?
At this time we are unable to customize your COFFEEBOXX.














Misc

Q: Why do I need a rugged coffee maker?
Today’s countertop-based appliances like coffee makers are made for just that – a clean, climate-controlled countertop space inside. The COFFEEBOXX was designed from the ground up based on portability and outdoor use. With those special conditions in mind, everything had to be re-thought – components needed to be reinforced, plastic needed to be UV resistant, the water tank needed to be spill proof and the entire unit had to be lightweight and compact to store. You get all that with the COFFEEBOXX.
Can I also use it in my home or office?
Absolutely. Made for the outdoors, the COFFEEBOXX loves to brew coffee indoors just like a good indoor gig takes you out of the elements.
I have a question not in the FAQ, where can I reach someone with my question?
If it is a product troubleshooting questions, reach out to support@oxx.com. If it is any other type of question, email info@oxx.com and we’ll route it to the appropriate team member to respond.

Jim Doan and Andrew Vanwylen of OXX, Inc. are using engineering and ingenuity to make products for rough environments. With the flagship Coffeeboxx, their small company is spreading out from its roots in Grand Rapids.


                

OXX, Inc is bringing ordinary luxuries to extraordinary places. From its home within Start Garden's enclave at 40 Ottawa, the company is putting out durable products that make the limitations of extreme workplaces a thing of the past.
 
Engineer Andrew Vanwylen describes OXX's mission as a promise to bring the comforts of the kitchen or office break room to hardworking individuals who otherwise don’t get to enjoy things the rest of us take for granted.
 
The company's flagship product, the Coffeeboxx, was the idea of OXX founder, and former design manager for Whirlpool, CEO Jim Doan. It's being marketed and sold in the U.S. and Canada as an incredibly tough, yet portable, and lightweight coffee maker.

"Just about everybody starts their day with coffee, regardless of where they're working, on a construction site or the office, people start their day with coffee. It's kind of an essential building block of the working day," Vanwylen says. 
 
The Coffeeboxx was created not only to meet that demand, but to best the ubiquitous stale coffee found in remote outdoor work or camp sites. With advances in K-Cup brewing technology, Doan says, there are new, more efficient ways to produce a quality cup of coffee.

"We just developed a system around that to heat up the water and shoot it through that capsule. It was more compelling that a traditional drip system," Doan says. "For us, the ability to be the first company to bring coffee beyond the home or office sounded very compelling. There was an opportunity to provide good coffee to people who just don't work in offices. They're outside for work or outdoor recreation, where you don't normally brew coffee."

Since the product was launched and began selling last year, Vanwylen, says he has regularly been hearing stories from Coffeeboxx users in exciting and dangerous environments. One client is a disaster relief first responder.
 
"He travels in after natural disasters to help the community," Vanwylen says. "He brings along quite a bit equipment to aide in the recovering, but he says that the Coffeeboxx is the first one he sets up because it energizes the team and brings a smile to those that need it most."
 
The Coffeeboxx has even been used at cruising altitudes, as Vanwylen has heard from a member of the U.S. Air Force.
 
 "He flies around the world in a C-17, and brews coffee at 30,000 feet," Vanwylen says, adding that hearing these stories is rewarding in many ways. "These customers are what keep us going, they work hard and make our country great, we are proud to make sure they have a cup of hot coffee while doing so."

The COFFEEBOXX from OXX on Vimeo.The product was featured on a Nov. 4 episode of Science Channel's "All-American Makers." Doan and Vanwylen watched as the show hosts disassembled the Coffeeboxx, analyzed it's integrity, reassembled it, and dropped it a few times before making some test coffee.
 
The OXX team is meticulous and thorough with its testing. The Coffeeboxx prototypes have been through a lot, brewing hundreds of gallons of coffee and hot water, brewing underneath the wheels of a parked Jeep Wrangler, and being dropped from different heights. It was taken apart and redesigned for strength and utility several times before it met the specifications the team was looking for. Vanwylen even field tested a unit over a July 4th weekend.
 
"I went up to a cabin with a bunch of buddies and the Coffeeboxx," he says. "I use this thing in real life, so I brought it up to the cabin and we kind of tossed it around a dirt yard. Afterwards we used it the entire weekend to brew coffee and it worked great."
 
Vanwylen says there are many other products in OXX's pipeline, too. 
 
"Wherever you work, you've got any number of appliances: a microwave, ice maker, things that heat food or chill food, ways to make beverages," Vanwylen says. "There are conveniences that make a work day a lot more pleasant."
 
Those are the conveniences that OXX seeks to deliver to more people in more places.
 
"Working at OXX is exciting because of the value we bring to our customers," Vanwylen says.
 
Vanwylen has a degree in finance from Grand Valley State University and will be finishing up an engineering degree in April 2016. It was actually in one of his engineering classes that he first got involved with OXX. A program alumni asked his class if someone would want to work with a team that made tools.
 
"He didn't even tell me they made coffee," Vanwylen says. "The product hadn't been released and it was very secretive. He said it was a startup company that makes the world’s toughest tools for those who need it. I followed along because it sounded like fun."
 
Vanwylen is still having fun, and OXX is operating smoothly with a pared down staff of five to eight people in concentrated roles. The company operates out of two pods in the Start Garden facility, one being office space, and the other Vanwylen's prototyping and testing lab. Currently, the Coffeeboxx is manufactured and assembled in China, but Vanwylen is able to accomplish any research and development or design from his lab in Grand Rapids.

A freshly vacuum carpet or mopped floor just seems to make the whole room look and feel so much cleaner. From wall-to-wall carpeting to area rugs to bare floors, there are many tools you can use reduce the dust, dirt, grime and other debris that builds up of your floors. Knowing what vacuum cleaners, sweepers, steam cleaners and other devices work for your specific needs lets you keep your floors spic and span. Vacuum Cleaners There are many different types of vacuum cleaners, and each one works best with specific flooring and types of surfaces. Types of vacuum cleaners include uprights, sticks, canisters, robotic, handheld and ones designed specifically for picking up pet hair. An upright is among the most common type of vacuum cleaners. Uprights are ideal because they work on a multitude of flooring types from deep pile carpeting to wood and tile floors. Uprights can be bagged or bagless. Bagged uprights usually have HEPA filters to keep the dust and pollen to a minimum; however, the bag needs replacing periodically. Bagless uprights contain what the vacuum cleaner picks up in a container attached to the vacuum, which empties easily. Stick vacuums are a light version of an upright vacuum cleaner. These types of vacuums are not as powerful as most other kinds but work well on bare floors and are good for low-pile carpeting like area rugs. They are also good for people who have a limited amount of storage space. Canister vacuum cleaners are powerful like uprights but are able clean in narrow spaces like a stick vacuum. These also have bags that must be changed out and often come with some accessories, such as crevice tools and brush attachments ideal for vacuuming upholstered furniture. handheld vacuums are cordless, battery-powered, rechargeable vacuum cleaners ideal for cleaning up small areas like stairs. They're useful for cleaning up quickly when it would be bothersome to bring out a larger vacuum cleaner. Robotic vacuum cleaners are also battery-powered and rechargeable vacuum cleaners, but they clean floors without human assistance. They are usually disc-shaped, meaning they can get under spaces that a normal vacuum cleaner cannot. Pet vacuums can, in most cases, be an upright, canister or stick vacuum cleaner, although there are some robotic and handheld vacuums specifically designed for pet hair. These tend to be powerful vacuum cleaners that can lift pet hair from carpeting and furniture and can keep the pet hair from getting caught in the vacuum cleaner's gearing. carpet cleanersCarpet cleaners use water and detergent to deep clean carpets, removing built-up grime, dirt and stains. Steam cleaners are carpet cleaners that use the hot water extraction method to remove stains and dirt. The hot water sprays onto the carpeting, sometimes with a cleaning solution, and then the steam cleaner sucks the water back up, taking the loosened dirt and other foreign material with it. Regular carpet cleaners follow the same process - only normal temperature water is mixed with a cleaning solution, sprayed onto the carpet, then vacuumed up with the steam cleaner. Most carpet cleaners are like upright vacuum cleaners in style, although there are some canister and portable carpet cleaners available as well. Sweepers and Wet-Dry Vacuum Cleaners Sweepers are an even lighter version of a vacuum cleaner. There typically have a handle that attaches to a base that has a rotating brush to pick up debris and dirt. These are not good for heavy-duty cleaning. Many are push-powered, although there are some that are battery-powered and rechargeable. At the other end of the vacuum spectrum, wet-dry, or shop, vacuum cleaners are powerful vacuum cleaners capable of picking up heavy-duty debris and liquids. These vacuum cleaners are barrel-shaped and come with wide, flexible hoses. These are typically seen in workshops, and are superb at picking up sawdust and metal shavings. Accessories There are numerous accessories available for vacuum cleaners with the most often needed ones being replacement vacuum cleaner bags and filters. As with the air filter on a car, the filters on a vacuum cleaner keep dust and pollen from being spit into the air while the vacuum is in use. Filters are replaceable easily as most just slide in and out from their position in the vacuum cleaner. Each type and brand of vacuum cleaner have specific bags that they use, so consult the owner's manual for your vacuum cleaner before purchasing replacement bags. If you've misplaced your owner's manual, you can usual find one online by searching for the model number of the vacuum. Replacement usually also offer some form of filtration, and some are scented to make the room smell better after using the vacuum cleaner. There are specific cleaning solutions required when using carpet and steam cleaners, and many are made by the manufacturer of the carpet cleaner. Both vacuum cleaners and carpet cleaners sometimes need to have certain parts replaced with belts being a common replacement for vacuum cleaners and pads and brushes being typical replacements for carpet cleaners.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332920, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
