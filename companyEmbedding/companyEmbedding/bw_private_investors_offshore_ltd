What You Should Know




Can I get an investment property funded using NONE of my own money?

                    Yes and no. It does not have to be your personal funds, however someone will typically have
                    to put money down toward the purchase of an investment property before a lender will seriously
                    consider your loan request. Lenders want you to have "some skin in the game."
                    As a rule of thumb make sure you have 5% or more available - the more the better.
                    If you are refinancing, money down is not always necessary provided you have sufficient equity in
                    the property.
                

What exactly does CiX do?

                    CiX takes the stress out of buying and refinancing investment properties by allowing consumers to
                    get multiple
                    offers from several hard and private money, asset-based lenders in a matter of minutes.
                

We make the funding process so easy, why would you need to look elsewhere?

                    It's free and only takes about 37 seconds to request the funding you need. Your request for funding
                    will be sent
                    to our lending partners who are ready, willing and able to lend on your property. We have the most;
                    diverse,
                    active, and professional pool of lenders on the planet, so if you can't get funding here, it's very
                    likely you
                    can't get funding anywhere.
                

The stress is finally gone

                    Before CiX existed, when you needed funding for a real estate investment you only really had one
                    option… Hope.
                    You had to present your deal to the one or two lenders you could find and hope they would come
                    through.
                    This is not only stressful but very time consuming. Many real estate investors spend more time
                    looking for money
                    than looking for deals. Not anymore. With CiX you can secure the funding you need with the click of
                    a few buttons.
                

Money is now looking for you

                    Lenders have raised billions to deploy into the market and need borrowers like you to lend to. It is
                    simple supply
                    and demand. Money is now looking for you! This means you have more options, can get better rates and
                    terms, and
                    ultimately keep more of the money you make.
                

All the best real estate investment lenders are here

                    We've consolidated the nations best hardmoney + private real estate investment lenders into a
                    funding database under one virtual roof. To gain access to this elite network and a virtually
                    unlimited amount of funding for residential and commercial lending, all you have to do is request
                    the type of funding you’re looking for. The best part is, this tool is 100% free!
                

Lenders will compete to fund your investment property

                    Your request for funding is sent to a network of qualified lenders. Our software analyzes their bids
                    and matches
                    you with the lenders who are willing to meet your unique needs at the lowest rate! For the first
                    time in history,
                    the real estate investment lending industry has been consolidated and is now fully available to you
                    with the click
                    of a few buttons!
                

You can receive loans based off the deal not your credit

                    Our network of lenders provides funding based on the numbers in the deal -- not your credit. Good
                    credit does not
                    hurt, but is not required. Since loans are based on the property, personal info such as bank
                    statements, tax returns,
                    social security number are not required to get matched with the right lender(s)!
                

You sure are lucky you found us

                    No more middlemen raising prices
                    No more missing deals because you can’t get funding
                    No more wasting time looking for lenders
                    No more overpaying for money
                

All of your funding problems are solved here!

                    You can finally get funding for your real estate investments without all the brain damage. Find the
                    cash you need to

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

What You Should Know




Can I get an investment property funded using NONE of my own money?

                    Yes and no. It does not have to be your personal funds, however someone will typically have
                    to put money down toward the purchase of an investment property before a lender will seriously
                    consider your loan request. Lenders want you to have "some skin in the game."
                    As a rule of thumb make sure you have 5% or more available - the more the better.
                    If you are refinancing, money down is not always necessary provided you have sufficient equity in
                    the property.
                

What exactly does CiX do?

                    CiX takes the stress out of buying and refinancing investment properties by allowing consumers to
                    get multiple
                    offers from several hard and private money, asset-based lenders in a matter of minutes.
                

We make the funding process so easy, why would you need to look elsewhere?

                    It's free and only takes about 37 seconds to request the funding you need. Your request for funding
                    will be sent
                    to our lending partners who are ready, willing and able to lend on your property. We have the most;
                    diverse,
                    active, and professional pool of lenders on the planet, so if you can't get funding here, it's very
                    likely you
                    can't get funding anywhere.
                

The stress is finally gone

                    Before CiX existed, when you needed funding for a real estate investment you only really had one
                    option… Hope.
                    You had to present your deal to the one or two lenders you could find and hope they would come
                    through.
                    This is not only stressful but very time consuming. Many real estate investors spend more time
                    looking for money
                    than looking for deals. Not anymore. With CiX you can secure the funding you need with the click of
                    a few buttons.
                

Money is now looking for you

                    Lenders have raised billions to deploy into the market and need borrowers like you to lend to. It is
                    simple supply
                    and demand. Money is now looking for you! This means you have more options, can get better rates and
                    terms, and

                    statements, tax returns,
