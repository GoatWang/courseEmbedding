BMO Private Investment Counsel Inc. Announces Proposed Merger of BMO Private Canadian Growth Equity Portfolio Into BMO Private Canadian Conservative Equity Portfolio



TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - May 4, 2016) - BMO Private Investment Counsel Inc. ("BPIC"), the investment management arm of BMO Private Banking and the manager of BMO Private Canadian Growth Equity Portfolio (the "Terminating Fund") and BMO Private Canadian Conservative Equity Portfolio (the "Continuing Fund") (collectively, the "Portfolios"), today announced a proposal to merge the Terminating Fund into the Continuing Fund (the "Proposed Merger"). 
BPIC intends to effect the Proposed Merger on or about July 8, 2016, provided receipt of regulatory approval. At the time of the Proposed Merger, BPIC would change the name of the Continuing Fund to BMO Private Canadian Core Equity Portfolio. 
As a provider of discretionary investment management services, BPIC will be filing an application with the securities regulators for relief from the requirement to obtain unitholder approval of the Proposed Merger and for regulatory approval to implement the Proposed Merger. 
The Independent Review Committee of the Portfolios approved the Proposed Merger after determining that the Proposed Merger, if implemented, would achieve a fair and reasonable result for the Portfolios. 
The primary purpose of the Proposed Merger is to streamline BPIC's product offering and to achieve economies of scale. Upon completion of the Proposed Merger, holders of units of the Terminating Fund will receive units of the Continuing Fund, determined on a dollar-for-dollar and tax-deferred basis. The Terminating Fund will be wound up following the Proposed Merger.

4. Each of the Funds is an open-ended mutual fund trust established under the laws of the Province of Ontario by declaration of trust.
5. Units of the BMO Private Portfolios are qualified for sale in each jurisdiction in Canada by a simplified prospectus dated May 7, 2015.
6. Each Fund is governed by NI 81-102, subject to any relief therefrom granted by the securities regulatory authorities.
7. The Funds are reporting issuers under the applicable securities legislation of each jurisdiction of Canada.
8. Neither the Filer nor the Funds are in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction of Canada.
9. Unless an exemption has been obtained, each of the Funds follows the standard investment restrictions and practices established by the securities regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in Canada.
10. The net asset value for units of the Funds is calculated on a daily basis on each day that the Toronto Stock Exchange is open for trading.
11. Each Fund pays all expenses relating to its operation and the carrying on of its business. Although any sub-advisory fees (including taxes) are an expense of each Fund, the Filer has agreed to absorb 0.15% (plus tax) of any sub-advisory fee payable for each Fund.
12. The Filer proposes to merge the Terminating Fund into the Continuing Fund on or about July 8, 2016.
13. Prior to or concurrently with the implementation of the Merger, the Filer anticipates changing the name of the Continuing Fund to BMO Private Canadian Core Equity Portfolio.
Unitholder Meeting Relief
14. The Filer offers fully discretionary investment management services to clients in each jurisdiction in Canada, including all of the investors in the BMO Private Portfolios.
15. The BMO Private Portfolios were established as an efficient and cost effective means of providing discretionary investment management services to many of the Filer's clients, including all of the investors in the Terminating Fund and the Continuing Fund, as an alternative to segregated account management.
16. The Filer has determined that it is appropriate to effect the Merger without obtaining unitholder approval.
17. The Filer believes that the Merger is in the best interests of the unitholders of the Terminating Fund and the Continuing Fund because:

(a) the Merger would result in unitholders being invested in a Continuing Fund with a portfolio of greater value, allowing for increased portfolio diversification opportunities;
(b) the Merger will be effected on a tax-deferred basis and thus will not trigger a capital gain or loss upon the transfer of each unitholder's investment from the Terminating Fund to the Continuing Fund;
(c) there will be a savings in brokerage charges over a straight liquidation of the Terminating Fund's portfolio on a wind-up of the Terminating Fund; and
(d) the Merger will eliminate the administrative and regulatory costs of operating the Terminating Fund as a separate mutual fund.

18. The proposed Merger is neutral to the unitholders of each of the Funds from a fee and expense perspective.
19. Paragraph 5.1(1)(f) of NI 81-102 requires that the approval of the securityholders of an investment fund be obtained before the investment fund undertakes a reorganization with, or transfers its assets to, another issuer.
20. Units of the Terminating Fund are only available for purchase by investors who have entered into a discretionary investment management agreement with the Filer.
21. The Filer is authorized under its discretionary investment management agreement with each client who is an investor in a BMO Private Portfolio to make any investment on behalf of the client (provided such investment is consistent with the mandate established by that client). Unitholders of a BMO Private Portfolio do not participate in the investment decision of purchasing, holding, or selling units of a BMO Private Portfolio.
22. Under its discretionary investment management agreement with each client, the Filer is authorized to receive all securityholder materials relating to the securities held in the client's account, and to vote on behalf of the client on any matters relating to the securities held in the client's account (provided that such vote is in the best interests of the client.)
23. The unitholders of the Terminating Fund are relying entirely on the Filer to make investment decisions for them and, in these circumstances, the Merger is analogous to the Filer changing a client's investment from one BMO Private Portfolio to another. As such investment changes do not require client approval, the Filer has determined that it is appropriate to effect the Merger without obtaining unitholder approval.
24. As every investor in the Terminating Fund has entered into a discretionary investment management agreement with the Filer, the Filer believes that sending meeting materials and convening unitholder meetings for the purpose of obtaining unitholder approval to effect the Merger is not desirable and represents an unnecessary cost and inconvenience to the Filer and the unitholders of the Terminating Fund.
25. Prior to, or no later than the next account statement mailing following the implementation of the Merger, the Filer will communicate with each client that holds units of the Terminating Fund to explain the changes to their account occurring as a result of the Merger.
Merger Approval
26. On April 27, 2016, the Filer presented the terms of the Merger to the IRC for its approval. The IRC reviewed the proposed Merger, determined that the Merger would achieve a fair and reasonable result for the Funds and has provided its approval in respect of the Merger.
27. Upon the approval of the Merger by the boards of directors of the Filer and of BMO Trust Company on May 3, 2016, a press release was issued and filed on May 4, 2016 and a material change report and amendment to the simplified prospectus of the Terminating Fund describing the Merger were filed on SEDAR, in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the Terminating Fund set forth in Part 11 of NI 81-106.
28. The Merger will be completed as a "qualifying exchange" within the meaning of section 132.2 of the Tax Act.
29. A reasonable person may not consider the fundamental investment objectives of the Terminating Fund and the Continuing Fund to be substantially similar. However, both Funds have substantially similar investment strategies and mandates in that they both provide exposure to equity securities of Canadian issuers. The Terminating Fund invests primarily in growth-oriented equity securities of Canadian issuers of any capitalization while the Continuing Fund invests primarily in equity securities of large Canadian issuers with any investment characteristic.
30. Units of the Terminating Fund will continue to be available for sale until the close of business on July 6, 2016, following which time the distribution of new units will cease, except under a continuous savings plan or similar systematic plan established prior to July 6, 2016.
31. No sales charges will be payable in connection with the issuance of units of the Continuing Fund in exchange for the investment portfolio of the Terminating Fund.
32. The portfolio assets of the Terminating Fund to be acquired by the Continuing Fund arising from the Merger are currently, or will be, acceptable, on or prior to the effective date of the Merger, to the portfolio advisor of the Continuing Fund and are or will be consistent with the investment objectives of the Continuing Fund.
33. Unitholders of the Terminating Fund will continue to have the right to redeem units of the Terminating Fund at any time up to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the effective date of the Merger.
34. The Filer will bear the costs and expenses associated with the Merger, including all brokerage expenses incurred in respect of any required sale of portfolio assets of the Terminating Fund.
35. Pursuant to the Merger, holders of units of the Terminating Fund will receive units of the Continuing Fund.
36. Following the Merger, the Continuing Fund will continue as a publicly offered open-ended mutual fund and the Terminating Fund will be wound up as soon as reasonably practicable.
37. Regulatory approval of the Merger is required because the Merger does not satisfy all of the criteria for pre-approved reorganizations and transfers as set out in section 5.6 of NI 81-102 because:

(a) a reasonable person may not consider the fundamental investment objectives of the Terminating Fund to be substantially similar to the fundamental investment objectives of the Continuing Fund, as contemplated in paragraph 5.6(1)(a)(ii);
(b) approval of the Merger will not be obtained by the unitholders of the Terminating Fund, as contemplated in subsection 5.6(1)(e)(i) of NI 81-102; and
(c) meeting materials will not be delivered to unitholders of the Terminating Fund in connection with such unitholder meeting, as contemplated in subsection 5.6(1)(f) of NI 81-102, since no unitholder meeting will be held in connection with the Merger.

38. The Filer will, except as noted above, comply with all of the other criteria for pre-approved reorganizations and transfers, as set out in section 5.6 of NI 81-102.

Decision
The principal regulator is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the principal regulator to make the decision.
The decision of the principal regulator under the Legislation is that the Requested Relief is granted.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
