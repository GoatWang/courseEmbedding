Permanens Capital :: Permanens :: How We Invest

























Our TeamHow we investContact Us



How We Invest
Permanens Capital believes:


Asset allocation must be customized for each client - no two clients are the same
Endowment allocators should have direct investment experience
Manager fees should be low cost and non-conflicted
Clients should avoid comingled asset exposure whenever possible
Conventional benchmarks often create pressure to conform and may add unintended risks
Investors have sacrificed liquidity and overpaid for mediocre investment performance


Permanens Capital creates customized investment governances and asset allocations that match client operating risks and cash flows. Utilizing a combination of inexpensive ETFs, funds, and customized sector portfolios, Permanens seeks to construct the lowest cost and most liquid custom portfolio for each client. Permanens aggregates client allocations to achieve institutional, lowest fee structures.
The Permanens Approach


Allocators frequently first find managers, then evaluate fees and terms, and lastly evaluate strategy
Permanens starts with an asset class, then finds the most appropriate, liquid, lowest fee exposure
We utilize customized, sub-advised portfolios, ETFs, mutual funds, and hedge funds
No active stock selection
Limited use of hedge funds, mostly for more complex assets
Avoid private wealth management execution costs and slippage
Minimize non-traditional risks: custody, commingling

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

NetSpend® Visa® Prepaid Card


                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

                                            The worst insurance company experience in 35 years. Bought a second home and added it to main house, two cars/drivers, and umbrella policy.

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more
