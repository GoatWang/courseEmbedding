	There are risks associated with investing in small-cap companies, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than stocks of large companies, including the increased risk of price fluctuations. There are also risks in investing in value-oriented stocks, including the risk that value-oriented stocks will underperform other asset types during a given period. It should not be assumed that the investment recommendations we make in the future will be profitable.

Approach - skylinelp













































 
 







 










 





















			 Approach		

Skyline Asset Management, L.P. has developed a disciplined investment approach for investing in the small capitalization sector of the equities market. We employ a fundamental, bottom-up methodology characterized by three factors: 1) A value-oriented approach. We select stocks with low P/E ratios based on trailing, not forecasted, earnings. 2) Attention to earnings. We seek companies with attractive earnings growth outlooks. 3) A focus on underfollowed, neglected, out-of-favor stocks. Through intensive research, we find good companies that are overlooked or not widely followed. We invest in firms with market capitalizations that are within the range of the Russell 2000 Index.

	Selecting companies with solid earnings growth prospects from a universe of low P/E stocks that are underfollowed provides exceptional performance potential at lower risk. This common sense philosophy is the heart of Skyline’s Small Cap Value equity approach.

	There are risks associated with investing in small-cap companies, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than stocks of large companies, including the increased risk of price fluctuations. There are also risks in investing in value-oriented stocks, including the risk that value-oriented stocks will underperform other asset types during a given period. It should not be assumed that the investment recommendations we make in the future will be profitable.
