		                                HUNTLEY AND ASSOCIATES, LLC ANNOUNCES SECOND ANNUAL ABB USERS' CONFERENCE
		                                

		                                  
One of the major economic challenges to delivering electrical energy in Alaska is providing adequate, reliable electrical infrastructure in Alaska’s extreme environment and across its wide geographical expanse.  For utilities on the Railbelt system, there may be opportunities to access lower cost energy from efficient gas generation facilities and renewables which cannot be realized due to unreliable transmission infrastructure and insufficient path redundancy.  For remote Alaska villages, high-cost electricity from local diesel-based generation could be displaced with renewables and distant, lower-cost generation if adequate transmission and storage infrastructure were available.  For the oil & gas industry, aging infrastructure and project economics demand a more efficient and optimized electrical infrastructure for continued profit and growth on Alaska’s North Slope.
The need for advanced electrical and storage infrastructure is no greater than anywhere else than in Alaska.
ABB has maintained a steady research and development program of electrical transmission and storage infrastructure to meet these unique needs.  From Grid Stability to Partnering for Improved Productivity, the 2014 ABB Users’ Conference will explore the Next Generation Integration that will help your organization meet the needs of tomorrow.    
Learn more about ABB’s advanced technologies for Grid Stability, including:

- PowerStore for maximum integration of renewables and fossil-based generation, and enhancement of network stability 
- HVDC Light Transmission for operation with weak AC networks 
- Conversion of single-circuit AC lines to HVDC for up to three times increased power transfer and double-circuit redundancy 
Learn about the advantages in Partnering for Improved Productivity and how your project can save costs and optimize your project plan utilizing:

- Resource Allocation
- Communication
- Engineering Support
- Project Management
- Design Interfaces
- Project Execution Plan
Please, mark your calendar and plan to attend our 2014 ABB Users’ Conference in Anchorage, AK on Wednesday, February 5, 2014!

		                                MIT Technology Review names ABB on its list of Top 50 global innovators
		                                

		                                  
MIT Technology Review, the official science and technology journal of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), named ABB to its 2013 list of top 50 global innovators.
ABB, the leading power and automation technology group, was cited for a technology breakthrough in 2012 that solved a 100-year-old electrical engineering puzzle and paved the way for a new generation of highly efficient and reliable power transmission grid. After years of research, ABB developed the world’s first circuit breaker for high voltage direct current (HVDC). It combines very fast mechanics with power electronics, and will be capable of interrupting power flows equivalent to the output of a large power station within 5 milliseconds - that is 30 times faster than the blink of a human eye.
The breakthrough removes a 100-year-old barrier to the development of DC transmission grids, which will enable the efficient integration and exchange of renewable energy sources on a large scale and enable the construction of a new more efficient grid able to transport electricity over very long distances. DC grids will also enhance the reliability and capacity of existing AC (alternating current) networks. ABB is in discussions with power utilities to identify pilot projects for the new development.

		                                  ABB has successfully designed and developed a hybrid DC breaker after years of  research, functional testing and simulation in the R&D laboratories. This breaker is a breakthrough that solves a technical  challenge that has been unresolved for over a hundred years and was perhaps one the main influencers in the ‘war of currents‘ outcome.

In terms of significance, this breaker is a ‘game changer’. It removes a significant stumbling block in the development of HVDC transmission grids where planning can start now. These grids will enable interconnection and load balancing between HVDC power superhighways integrating renewables and transporting bulk power across long distances with minimal losses. DC grids will enable sharing of resources like lines and converter stations that provides reliability and redundancy in a power network in an economically viable manner with minimal losses.

Storing Electrical Energy Efficiently

                            Electrical energy cannot be stored directly, but it can be stored in other forms and then converted back to electricity when needed.
                            

                            With our range of dynamic Battery Energy Storage Systems, ABB has developed an effective and efficient approach that enables energy produced by either conventional thermal generation or renewable sources to be stored and then made available as required.
                            

As a major contribution to achieving stringent environmental targets, our battery systems do not emit any CO2 emissions. They also maximize the efficient use of renewable energy sources by reducing their inherent intermittency, facilitating integration into the power chain.



Systems




		                                An electrical battery is a combination of one or more electrochemical cells, used to convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. 
		                                

		                                Batteries form the main storage component for energy storage systems with a huge range of technologies and chemistries available from single lead acid, to more exotics such as Li-Ion, Ni-Cd sodium sulphur (Nas) and Vanadium redox flow.

The prime function of the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is to provide spinning reserve in the event of power plant or transmission line equipment failure. For these systems rechargeable batteries are used to store electricity in the form of chemical energy. ABB has different kinds of BESS equipped with the corresponding converter.

Key Benefits



		                               Stability and flexibility

One of the key benefits of ABB’s Battery Energy Storage Systems is their contribution to maintaining grid stability and flexibility through effective energy storage and power flow management, enhancing grid stability and flexibility and delivering power-on-demand whenever it is needed.

Harnessing renewables

The integration of renewable sources without supporting storage technologies exposes the grid to stability issues, due to the inherent intermittency of wind, solar and marine power. The grid integration of renewable energy sources in combination with Battery Energy Storage Systems reduces the intermittency of renewable sources, increasing their capacity factor.

In addition, energy storage can prevent wastage of excess renewable energy feeding into the grid at times when production is at a peak, but demand is low. Instead, this energy is now stored effectively.

Power quality

ABB technology is already used extensively for the management of reactive power, the addition of our Battery Energy Storage Systems provides a further dimension – the management of active power. Our power converter systems have the capability to meet both reactive and active power needs, providing the grid with the flexibility to manage any situation, at any time in the daily demand cycle and for prolonged periods of time.

Infrastructure

The integration of Battery Energy Storage Systems into transmission and distribution networks has the potential to provide significant benefits at all points in the power chain.

ABB’s complete range of Battery Energy Storage Systems is designed to cover all scenarios, from new to existing infrastructure and small to large installations. Our battery systems can improve the power quality of existing grids, helping to prolong their lifespan and therefore their cost-effectiveness.

Power

Our wide range of Battery Energy Storage Systems is designed to cover every power range, from tens of kilowatts (kW) to hundreds of megawatts (MW).

Flexible location

Our Battery Energy Storage Systems have the flexibility to be installed in any geographical location, temperature and terrain. This way they can be installed in the most appropriate and advantageous position for their use, whatever the local environment.

Vehicle electrification

Looking to the future, the increasing use of electric vehicles will have a considerable impact on the demand for electricity and the development of future power grids.
The production of electric vehicles is predicted to rise dramatically, as automotive manufacturers look for alternative means of powering their vehicles.

Integrating ABB’s Battery Energy Storage Systems into existing and new grids will facilitate vehicle electrification programs by ensuring a stable and consistent supply of the electricity vital to charge their onboard batteries.

Active Power Chain Management

 As a leader in power and automation, ABB has developed its Battery Energy Storage Systems to actively manage a variety of issues in the power value chain.


		                               Load Leveling

The use of energy storage is a natural and effective complement to load levelling that makes it possible to store excess energy produced when demand is low and then make it available when demand is high.

This approach is particularly useful in industrial applications, where, for example, there may be sufficient energy available for the load, but occasionally, insufficient power. In this case, rather than reinforcing the plant feeder, an energy storage installation can be a more cost-effective and faster to implement solution.

Peak Power Shaving

Our Battery Energy Storage Systems offer peak power shaving capabilities by delivering stored energy to the grid during periods of high demand, reducing the burden on the distribution network. This effectively reduces the gap between peak and average demand, improving the overall efficiency with which the electrical energy is used.


Power Smoothing

Power smoothing to prevent sudden surges or drops in power supply is another key advantage of our Battery Energy Storage Systems. The stored energy smoothes out any erratic power from intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power plants, so that the utility receives constant and consistent power.

Islanding

In islanding applications, energy stored in our storage systems can be used to supply network power to a section of the grid, whenever utility power is not available.

Dynamic Frequency Control

Regulation of grid frequency within pre-set limits is another key area of demand management to avoid power supply interruptions due to the whole grid “slowing down”.

Our Battery Energy Storage Systems can ensure effective grid frequency management by absorbing power when the frequency is too high and injecting power when the frequency is too low.

		                               Battery energy storage increases the role of renewables

Falbygdens Energi is a Swedish utility which already has a significant proportion of wind power connected to the grid in the Swedish city of Falköping.

ABB was selected to supply an innovative dynamic energy storage solution for the utility’s power distribution network, to maximise the integration of renewables into the power chain.

For this project, ABB utilized its battery energy storage expertise to store locally produced energy from wind turbines to create a storage capacity of 75 kW in cycles of up to 60 minutes. The stored energy will then be used to stabilize the grid and help balance peak loads during the day.

This project is a key step in evaluating the role of energy storage technology and the further integration of renewable energies and evolution of smarter grids. The solution will also be used to investigate the feasibility of deploying the stored energy as auxiliary power for the charging of electrical vehicles.

Frequently Asked Questions





The Solution

                            HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) and HVDC Light
                            

HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) and HVDC Light® are systems for transmission of electric power. Both systems are applied to meet special requirements in power grids, and consist of a cable or line for direct current and two (or more) converter stations. 

This page will try to explain where HVDC and HVDC Light can be used and what the benefits are.
                            

With a few exceptions, all power lines you see in your surroundings carry alternating current (AC) that oscillates with 50 or 60 cycles per second - whether they are for (extra) high voltage, for medium voltage or for the low voltage distribution grid. These lines form a large interconnected network that ties the power generation plants (coal, gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, etc.) to the consumers.

But where does HVDC come in? It is used to interconnect separate power systems, where traditional alternating current (AC) connections can not be used.

The classical HVDC technique was first introduced in Sweden (Gotland link) in 1954 by ASEA (a founding company of ABB). Today there are over 100 projects in all parts of the world. Typically, a classical HVDC transmission has a power of more than 100 Megawatt (MW) and many are in the 1,000 - 3,000 MW range. There are classical HVDC transmissions that use overhead lines and that use undersea (and underground) cables (or combinations of cables and lines).

HVDC Light® can be called "The invisible power transmission" since it is based on underground cables, although over head lines also are a possibility. It is a fundamentally new power transmission technology developed by ABB in the 1990's. HVDC Light uses underground or submarine cables. The technology extends the economical power range of HVDC transmission down to just a few tens of Megawatts (MW). In the upper range, the technology can reach 1,200 MW and ±320 kV.

In both classical HVDC and HVDC Light it is possible to transmit power in both directions.


Applications for classical HVDC

In summary we find the use for classical HVDC in a power system:
· Long undersea cable links (> 50 km)
· Long overhead lines (> 600 km)
· Interconnection of different grids or networks
· Where control of transmitted power is of importance
· Combinations of the above
· Applications for HVDC Light®

The same applications as for classical HVDC are valid also for HVDC Light, but due to the smaller power rating of HVDC Light, its underground cable technology and its superior controllability, there are many more potential applications than for classical HVDC. 

The fact that it is possible to build a long electric power transmission underground and avoid public opposition and long uncertain approval processes, makes the HVDC Light system very attractive. Some of the HVDC Light applications that are in commercial operation are listed here: 

· Long underground cable link (70 km Gotland HVDC Light) from a wind park (Sweden).
· Long underground cable links (59 km Terranora interconnector & 180 km Murraylink) between different grids (Australia)
· Undersea cable link (40 km Cross Sound Cable) to Long Island (NY, USA)
· Long undersea cable link (70 km Troll A) to feed power to an offshore gas production platform (Norway)
· Interconnection of different grids (Eagle Pass)(USA)

One of the characteristics of HVDC Light is its superior ability to stabilize the AC voltage at the terminals. This is particularly important for wind parks, where the variation in wind speed can cause severe voltage fluctuations.

HVDC Light has also the potential of becoming the preferred system for power in feeds to cities, for strengthening of power networks in areas where the public is opposed to new overhead lines, and for evacuation of trapped marginal generation resources where a new extra high voltage AC line would be too costly. But this requires thinking outside the box.

Overview




		                                Why HVDC? 
		                                

Power stations generate alternating current, AC, and the power delivered to the consumers is in the form of AC. Why then is it sometimes more suitable to use direct current, HVDC, for transmitting electric power?

Each individual transmission project will display its own set of reasons justifying the choice of HVDC, but the most common arguments favoring HVDC are:

· Lower losses
· Long distance water crossing
· Asynchronous interconnections
· Controllability
· Limit short circuit currents
· Environment
· Lower investment cost

In general terms the different reasons for using HVDC can be divided in two main groups, namely: 

1. HVDC is necessary or desirable from the technical point of view (i.e. controllability).

2. HVDC results in a lower total investment (including lower losses) and/or is environmentally superior.
Today the environmental aspects are also becoming more important. HVDC is in that respect favorable in many cases, as the environmental impact is less than with AC. This is due to the fact that an HVDC transmission line is much smaller and needs less space than AC lines for the same power capacity. 











                                19th century debate shaped the power industry as we know it today
                                
Perhaps the biggest technology debate that shaped the power industry was played out in New York in the 19th century: AC (alternating current) versus DC (direct current).
                                


Tesla vs. Edison


		                                AC vs. DC
		                                

		                                  Few remember the debate itself, but the characters are still well known. You had Thomas Edison (image, right) and GE on one side, pushing for the power transmission and distribution system to be based on DC. On the other side, Nikola Tesla (image, left) and Westinghouse put all their effort into promoting AC. With electricity supplies in their infancy, much depended on choosing the right technology to power homes and businesses across the country. 

This was when the industrial revolution was accelerating in the US and famous men like Andrew Carnegie, JP Morgan and others where known for their aggressive industrial growth practices, and the two sides in this conflict didn’t have too many scruples either: DC’s leading supporters often resorted to very questionable marketing practices to exaggerate the dangers of AC.

But the dirty tricks didn’t help and the War of the Currents was won by AC, which has been the platform for electrical transmission across the world since that time.

However, New York City, being the battle ground for this war, had already invested in a number of Edison DC installations, and these of course continued to work for many years alongside the growing AC network. It wasn’t until 1927 that New York decided to replace the DC equipment, and it wasn’t until 2007 – just four years ago – that the last of it was removed – a full 125 years after the end of the War of the Currents.

But while AC was perfectly adequate for the conditions of the day – and for much of the 20th century – the needs of the 21st century are showing its limits. And the irony is that, although Edison lost the battle, his direct current is making a comeback just as New York City has finally rid itself of the standard. Today, it is not a question of AC versus DC, but of AC and DC. 

This is because we are facing a revolution in the way our electricity is produced and used. On the production side, more and more electricity is being generated from renewable sources of energy either in remote areas (hydropower plants in mountains far from urban centers, offshore wind farms) or locally (rooftop solar panels). DC is the only technology that allows power to be transmitted economically over very long distances, and DC is the type of power produced by photovoltaic panels.

As far as using power is concerned, more and more equipment runs on DC, such as computers, cell phones and LED lights. At the moment, each of these appliances uses its own rectifier to switch power from AC to DC. A much more efficient solution would be to convert the power in a larger rectifier as it enters each building. ABB estimates the savings from using DC instead of AC in buildings could be in the order of 10 to 20 percent.

Losses could be further reduced by converting power to DC at the substation level and distributing DC power throughout an entire district, or even by transmitting, distributing and using power as DC. For these scenarios some technological challenges remain – such as the development of DC breakers – but will likely be overcome within a few years. 

Batteries are another technology that runs on DC power and there are more and more of these around us storing excess power produced from renewable energy installations during favorable weather conditions and powering electric cars.

It would be impractical and expensive to implement DC distribution grids where AC distribution grids already exist, but DC may increasingly become the solution of choice in new districts or cities, where new communities are electrified for the first time, and where electrification “islands” (not connected to the main power network) are created. Such islands include new ships and communities generating their own power from renewable resources.

DC distribution would be particularly attractive for communities using power generated by photovoltaic solar panels, since this is already DC power and currently has to be converted to AC before distribution.

In addition, DC offers greater capacity per power line, reducing the weight and size of power equipment throughout the grid and home, and can help to improve the reliability of power supplies as it is easier to control the voltage on DC lines and because DC connections do not cascade faults and cause blackouts the way AC lines can do.

The main benefits of DC based grids would be:

•	Greater energy efficiency
•	Higher power quality
•	Smaller equipment
•	Less complexity and lower costs

After years of research, ABB has developed the world’s first circuit breaker for high voltage direct current (HVDC). The breakthrough removes a 100-year-old barrier to the development of DC transmission grids, which will enable the efficient integration and exchange of renewable energy. DC grids will also improve grid reliability and enhance the capability of existing AC (alternating current) networks. Read more about The Breakthrough

The Hybrid HVDC Breaker

7 November 2012

		                                ABB WRITES NEW CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
		                                

		                                  ABB has successfully designed and developed a hybrid DC breaker after years of  research, functional testing and simulation in the R&D laboratories. This breaker is a breakthrough that solves a technical  challenge that has been unresolved for over a hundred years and was perhaps one the main influencers in the ‘war of currents‘ outcome.  The ‘hybrid’ breaker combines mechanical and power electronics switching that enables it to interrupt power flows equivalent to the output of a nuclear power station within 5 milliseconds – that’s as fast as a honey bee takes per flap of its wing – and twice as fast as it takes Usain Bolt to react to the starter’s gun!  But its not just about speed. The challenge was to do it ‘ultra-fast’ with minimal operational losses and this has been achieved by combining advanced ultrafast mechanical actuators with our inhouse semiconductor IGBT valve technologies or power electronics (watch video: Hybrid HVDC Breaker – How does it work).

In terms of significance, this breaker is a ‘game changer’. It removes a significant stumbling block in the development of HVDC transmission grids where planning can start now. These grids will enable interconnection and load balancing between HVDC power superhighways integrating renewables and transporting bulk power across long distances with minimal losses. DC grids will enable sharing of resources like lines and converter stations that provides reliability and redundancy in a power network in an economically viable manner with minimal losses. ABB’s new Hybrid HVDC breaker, in simple terms will enable the transmission system to maintain power flow even if there is a fault on one of the lines.

This is a major achievement for the global R&D team in ABB who have worked for years on the challenge and finally come up with a circuit breaker capable of blocking and breaking DC currents at thousands of amperes and several  hundred thousands of volts -  corresponding to the average power consumption of one million Europeans ! It amounts to stopping power capable of feeding a large city much faster than an eye blink ! This speed helps protect the DC transmission system and prevent power outages in new low loss compact power superhighways. The next step is to install the breaker in pilot installations.

HVDC transmission remains a technology of choice for bulk power transmission over long distances with minimum losses. HVDC lines also require less space and are capable of going underground or underwater. Voltage source converter based HVDC applications in embedded AC grids and for offshore connections have grown substantially, in line with quantum leaps in power ratings and significant loss reductions.  ABB pioneered HVDC transmission nearly 60 years ago and accounts for half the world’s HVDC installed base. It is befitting that the company that commissioned the world’s first 800 kilovolt UHVDC systems, the longest overhead HVDC link to go into commercial operation, the world’s longest underwater and underground HVDC links now writes the next chapter in the history of this technology and marks an important milestone in the legacy of electrical engineering.
		                                










From Humble Beginnings


                                From 'joining the dots' to 'connecting the lines'
                                

                                The ability to transfer large quantities of electricity across vast distances with low losses and using minimal space combined with the feasibility of going underwater or underground make HVDC (high voltage direct current) a sought after technology across the world.  But it came from humble beginnings.

Frequently Asked Questions


What is alternating current?
		                                

		                                  Alternating current is a form of electricity in which the current alternates in direction (and the voltage alternates in polarity) at a frequency defined by the generator (usually between 50 and 60 times per second, ie, 50 - 60 hertz).
AC was adopted for power transmission in the early days of electricity supply because it had two major advantages over direct current (DC): its voltage could be stepped up or down according to need using transformers and it could be interrupted more easily than DC.

What is direct current?
		                                

		                                  This is electrical current that does not alternate (see alternating current), the electrons flow through the circuit in one direction.
As a result, DC does not generate reactive power (see Reactive Power). This means that, in a DC system, only real (or active) power is transmitted, making better use of the system’s capacity. The transmission of DC current has very low losses.

What is reactive power?
		                                

		                                  It is a concept that describes the loss of power in a system resulting from the production of electric and magnetic fields in it.

What is the DC grid?
		                                

		                                 Today’s electrical transmission systems are almost exclusively based on alternating current (AC), but the development of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology has made it possible to build a DC grid that can handle bulk power flows over long distances. Power from such DC grids can be fed into the AC networks as needed.

What is high-voltage direct current (HVDC)?
		                                

		                                 A technology developed by ABB in the 1950s to move large amounts of power over substantial distances - typically by overhead transmission lines, but also by way of submarine cables. Another important aspect of HVDC lines is that they can never be overloaded. Because HVDC transmits only active (real) power, no line capacity is wasted on transmitting reactive power. This means that the same power can be transmitted over fewer (or smaller) transmission lines than would be required using AC, and less land is needed to accommodate the lines. HVDC induces minimal magnetic fields, so the power lines may be built safely closer to human habitation.

What is HVDC Light?
		                                

		                                 An adaptation of classic HVDC, developed by ABB in the 1990s. It can be used to transmit electricity in lower power ranges (tens of megawatts) to an upper range of 1,100 megawatt (MW) (±320 kilovolts).HVDC Light offers the same benefits as traditional HVDC systems, but also provides more secure power control (superior to classic HVDC) and quick power restoration in the event of a blackout. It is the only technology available that allows long-distance underground high-voltage transmission.

What is a converter station?
		                                

		                                 Special equipment is needed to convert electricity from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), or vice versa. HVDC converter stations use power electronic devices called thyristors to make these conversions.

What is a thyristor?
		                                

		                                 A thyristor is a semiconductor device used in HVDC installations, as a high-speed, high-power switch, capable of turning power supplies of many megawatts on within a split second. Thyristors are a component used in inverters and rectifiers. (See also Inverter and Rectifier).

What is a semiconductor?
		                                

		                                 A semiconductor is a material whose electrical properties can be significantly influenced by physical factors (mostly electrical conditions, but also pressure, temperature, light, etc). This means that a semiconductor will behave either as an insulator or a conductor of electricity, depending on the conditions to which it is exposed.

What is an inverter?
		                                

		                                 An electrical device for converting direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC).


What is an rectifier?
		                                

		                                An electrical device used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC).


What is an circuit breaker?
		                                

		                                Devices that interrupt high currents to protect electrical equipment from damage caused by current surges, eg, from a short circuit or a lightning strike. (On a much smaller scale, they are used as an alternative to fuses in the home.)


What is switchgear?
		                                

		                                Equipment used to control, protect, and regulate the flow of electrical power in a transmission or distribution network. It is often located in substations, but can be associated with any electrical equipment that might need to be isolated for fault correction (eg, if a voltage drop occurred in one part of the grid, it might be necessary to shut off the affected section to prevent the fault spreading), or for maintenance purposes. The main components of switchgear are circuit breakers, which interrupt high-voltage current to protect electrical equipment from excessive current.


What is meant by transmission and distribution (T&D)?
		                                

		                                Transmission is the movement of power at high voltage (above ca. 50 kV), usually over long distances. Raising the voltage allows power to be transmitted more efficiently, ie, with lower losses. Distribution is the transport of electricity at medium voltage (between ca. 1 and 50 kV) over shorter distances to industrial, commercial and residential areas.

                                        Our Value Formula
                                        

                                        Baldor's Value Formula simply illustrates the equal importance of four factors that shape our customers' perception of value. Quality and Service are factors we strive to increase, thus raising perceived (subscript "p") Value. Cost and Time are factors we strive to reduce, also raising perceived value.
                                        


                                        Quality
                                        

                                        At Baldor, we use many internal measurements for "quality." However, we are referring here to quality as perceived by our customers.

That's why we spend thousands of hours every year talking to our customers, in person, to see how we measure up. We're proud to say that Baldor consistently grades very high in every aspect.

There is no perfect score, of course, but we're headed in the right direction. In 2000, 90% of all known customer studies named Baldor first when asking "What motor line do you prefer?" 
                                        


                                        Service
                                        

                                        We believe that "service" goes beyond responding to customer requests. It must exceed expectations by offering answers and solutions before they're needed. This includes availability of accurate information -- an area that's increasingly important in this age of instant decisions.
Our industry-leading CD-ROM and Web site make information immediately accessible to all our customers. Baldor even offers extensive training classes, on site.

But Service also involves trust. Customers must believe in Baldor products. It gets down to reputation, something every Baldor employee values highly and takes very seriously.
                                        


                                        Cost
                                        

                                        We understand that the true "cost" of a motor or drive goes far beyond its purchase price. An energy-efficient motor saves money in the user's electricity costs, providing long-term savings that pay back the initial investment many times over. Baldor has been designing, manufacturing and marketing energy-efficient motors since 1920.

Many Baldor motors feature our exclusive ISR® (Inverter Spike Resistant®) wire. This helps extend the life of our motors and minimizes repair and replacement costs. And with Matched PerformanceTM pairings of motors and controls, our customers get lab-tested performance ratings that can sometimes save half the energy costs.

Our Projects




                                        Golden Valley Electric Association
Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)
                                        

                                        Completed in December 2003, the BESS is one of GVEA's initiatives to improve the reliability of service to GVEA members. In the event of a generation or transmission related outage, it can provide 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes. That's enough time for the co-op to start up local generation when there are problems with the Intertie or power plants in Anchorage. More >>
