Margaret B. Shannon
Owned River‘s On The River In Sandy Hook
Margaret “Peggy” (Brinckerhoff) Shannon, 82, of Winchester, N.H., and previously of Sandy Hook, died June 27 surrounded by her loved ones after a long illness. She was the wife of the late Robert J. Shannon.
She was born in Danbury on November 23, 1925, a daughter of Herbert and Margaret (Boughton) Brinckerhoff. She grew up in Redding and graduated from Danbury High School, where she played basketball, and the trumpet in the school band.
She was a graduate of Goddard College. In her twenties she spent winters in Vermont and the summers in Rhode Island. She enjoyed golf, which is how she met her husband. They were married on January 17, 1959, and made their home in Sandy Hook.
In Sandy Hook, the Shannons raised their four children and owned a package store, River’s on the River, which was on Lake Zoar, and had a boat launch. Their extended families spent many happy years on this property. They also purchased a “camp” in Winchester, N.H., where they made many friends. Mrs Shannon also enjoyed boating and snowmobiling.
Upon retirement, the Shannons enjoyed Las Vegas, Aruba, going to the Olympics, the Kentucky Derby, and other horse races, until Mr Shannon’s death in August of 1996. Mrs Shannon also made trips to Australia with her sister, to Alaska with her daughter and daughter-in-law, and Hawaii with her sister and daughter.
Mrs Shannon moved to Winchester to be closer to her daughter. She was a loving grandmother who enjoyed the grandkids, watching their sports activities and school achievements. She looked forward to when all of her children and grandchildren would be at her home, not only for visits and holidays, but for the lobster fests. She will be greatly missed by her family.
Survivors include her daughter Margaret Sharra and her husband, Scott, of Winchester, N.H.; three sons, Jim Shannon and his fiancÃ©, Ronda Thompson, of Winchester, Michael Shannon and his wife, Patricia, of Sandy Hook, and Robert Shannon of Constableville, N.Y.; two brothers, Derek Brinckerhoff and his wife, Hester, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Herbert (Brink) Brinckerhoff and his wife, Sandra, of Old Saybrook; a sister, Jane Pisappa of Winchester; and a sister-in-law, Shirley Glynn of Sandy Hook. She is also survived by her grandchildren, Brooke, Chris, and Jordan Sharra of Winchester, James and Andrew Shannon of Winchester, and Michael and Matthew Shannon of Sandy Hook; and five nieces.
Funeral Services were held July 1 in the Honan Funeral Home, Newtown. Interment in St Rose Cemetery, Sandy Hook, was July 2.
Memorial contributions may be made to Hospice of Cheshire County, PO Box 564, Keene NH 03431.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release (and oral statements regarding the subject matter of this release) contains forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the "safe harbor" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, market leadership, emerging opportunities, and Quanta's strategic growth initiatives, as well as statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events, and other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or beyond our control, including, among others, the effects of industry, economic or political conditions outside of the control of Quanta; trends and growth opportunities in relevant markets; the potential to incur losses with respect to our operations; the ability to generate internal growth; the ability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions; the ability to effectively compete for new projects and market share; risks associated with operating in international markets; potential liabilities associated with multiemployer pension plans; unexpected costs or liabilities that may arise from lawsuits or indemnity claims related to the services Quanta performs; liabilities for claims that are self-insured; and the ability to capitalize on business opportunities and other factors affecting Quanta's business generally, including risks detailed in Quanta's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and any other documents of Quanta filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are current only as of this date. Quanta does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, investors are urged to refer to Quanta's documents filed with the SEC that are available through the company's website at www.quantaservices.com or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System (EDGAR) at www.sec.gov.
