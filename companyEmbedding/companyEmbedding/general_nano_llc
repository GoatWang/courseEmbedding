Perform Smarter









 WHAT WE DOGeneral Nano manufactures Veelo™, a new-class of lightweight, conductive, multifunctional materials that improve the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) of next generation air vehicles, including aircraft, rotorcraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), satellites, and missiles.  Seven years ago, General Nano’s engineers began developing Veelo™ with the clear goal of driving sustainability and improving science.  We believe that impacting 21st century priorities is not somebody else’s responsibility – it’s ours.Today, General Nano works side-by-side leading technologists at the Department of Defense, NASA and global aerospace and defense companies to transition Veelo™ into real-world applications, including multifunctional carbon fiber composites, deicing and anti-icing systems, lightweight data cables, lightning strike protection, EMI shielding, and blackbody calibrators for advanced satellite imaging.General Nano is rapidly growing because of its high-caliber relationships, ability to collaborate, and technical skill. The company has distinguished itself by creating a manufacturing process that empowers engineers to design products with uniquely tailored properties that deliver new levels of application performance. For example, Veelo HEAT™, Veelo SHIELD™, and Veelo STRIKE™ are supplied in continuous sheet, tape, and film forms and can be customized by electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. Veelo BLAC™ is a specialty coating product optimized at the nanoscale and manufactured on device-size or macro-scale substrates.  In 2018, Veelo BLAC™ will be launched on a NASA CubeSat to measure Earth sciences. This is possible because Veelo BLAC™ outperforms existing technology and is supplied in a product form that customers can seamlessly integrate without changing manufacturing processes.Driving Sustainability, Improving Science, and Impacting 21st Century Priorities is our Purpose.  If you share our passion to create technologies that enable society to Perform Smarter™, contact us. After all, our mission started in response to a simple question from a visionary that contacted us seven years ago --- “What’s the plan for your technology?”  Please reach out.  We would love to talk with you.

NASA & Satellite Manufacturer Select Veelo BLAC™ for Prestigious InVEST Program




May  9, 2016

Steve Brown



May  9, 2016

Steve Brown




Veelo BLAC™, a super-black material that absorbs more than 99.6 percent of light, will be traveling to space as part of NASA’s Earth Science CubeSat Program on a 2018 mission to the International Space Station.Compact Infrared Radiometer in Space (CIRiS) is an uncooled imaging infrared radiometer that is designed to provide high radiometric performance from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). CIRiS will travel to space on a CubeSat. Veelo BLAC™ will be used to adapt an existing component of CIRiS to be CubeSat compatible. Veelo BLAC™ reduces on-board calibration time and improves accuracy of collected data. CIRiS instrumentation is part of NASA’s LEO satellite program which has been established to perform breakthrough scientific research in land use management and climate change measurement.

NORWOOD, Ohio — Things are looking up for Norwood-based General Nano LLC, a manufacturer of carbon nanotubes.Literally, looking up.In December, Boulder, Colorado-based Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. announced that NASA had chosen them to build and test a satellite that will be launched into low-earth orbit in early 2018. General Nano is building a carbon nanotube “black box” for a camera in that satellite, its first product for space-based use, said CEO Joseph Sprengard.“The problem with gathering information in space is that you get stray light from the stars and the sun,” he said. “The nanotubes absorb light wavelengths really well.”Learn more about this cutting-edge technology by becoming a WCPO Insider.

NORWOOD, Ohio — Things are looking up for Norwood-based General Nano LLC, a manufacturer of carbon nanotubes.Literally, looking up.In December, Boulder, Colorado-based Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. announced that NASA had chosen them to build and test a satellite that will be launched into low-earth orbit in early 2018. General Nano is building a carbon nanotube “black box” for a camera in that satellite, its first product for space-based use, said CEO Joseph Sprengard.“The problem with gathering information in space is that you get stray light from the stars and the sun,” he said. “The nanotubes absorb light wavelengths really well.”What’s a Carbon Nanotube?It’s a carbon atom in the shape of a cylinder – and nature doesn’t make them that way. General Nano “grows” them by planting “seeds” of tiny metallic particles on a surface, then exposing them to gases, temperatures and pressures that curl up that carbon. The process takes three to 20 minutes, depending on the length of the tube required.At the atomic level, nanotubes are more conductive than copper and stronger than steel, Sprengard said. They’re very useful in industries such as aerospace, where light, strong and conductive material is needed.

What’s So Great About General Nano’s Nanotubes?The company makes the tubes into continuous rolls that are easy to handle and apply in known manufacturing processes, Sprengard said. Customers can cut those rolls into sheets and put them into carbon fiber composites to make them stronger and conductive. General Nano is the only supplier of continuous carbon nanotube sheet products in the United States, Sprengard said. He knows this through contacts with customers and suppliers, he said. The sheets make up about 80 percent of the business, he said. The other 20 percent is “vertically aligned” nanotubes, not made into sheets but used as anti-reflective material such as will be used in the satellite. Who Started the Business?It was founded by University of Cincinnati Nanoworld Lab directors Vesselin Shanov and Mark Schulz, who made a breakthrough in nanotube technology in 2007. The U.S. Air Force learned about it and asked them if they had plans to commercialize the technology. Sprengard was asked to help bring the product to market. He previously worked in finance and development for a strategy consulting firm and in commercial banking.“They needed someone who could dedicate himself full time to launching the business,” he said. The three men own the company, along with a silent partner.How Big is the Business?Revenue was a record $1.3 million in 2015. The company doesn’t reveal customers’ names, Sprengard said, but it has contracts with seven of the top 10 aerospace contractors in the United States. There are four employees, including Sprengard, but about 70 others are involved though contract partnerships, subcontracts and research contracts.The company has raised $7 million from investors and development contracts from customers who need, for example, proof of concept for a product. That includes a $1 million investment from Ohio Third Frontier, a state program designed to create tech jobs, which the company used to buy its first round of manufacturing equipment.“Generally, businesses like ours are not overly exciting to (investors) until they need growth capital,” Sprengard said. “That’s why it’s so very important that government makes investments, because the commercial market will not do that.”What’s Next?General Nano is growing and needs more room, so a new facility is on the horizon. The owners are looking for a building in the Tri-State and expect to move by the end of 2016. Currently, offices are in the Hamilton County Development Center, with manufacturing done at off-site locations.Meanwhile, management is looking at new markets, such as shielding for the wire and cable industry, as well as de-icing and anti-icing systems. And the company soon will change its focus from research to production with an emphasis on quality control and control of expenses.Key to General Nano’s success is not trying to grow too fast, Sprengard said, which has been the downfall of many nanotube companies.“I’m proud of our team,” he said. “We’ve got a bunch of highly skilled folks who are very focused on deliverables. That allows a young company to win.”
