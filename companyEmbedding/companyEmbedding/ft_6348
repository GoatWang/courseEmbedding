Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...





Home Values & Sold Home Prices

Ever wonder, "how much is my house worth?" Search by state, city, zip code, or address to find homes recently sold in your neighborhood. Home values are calculated from sold prices, public records of assessed value, and area real estate information.

Home of the Secret Society of Smoked Mullet, what?

                    Englewood is a shared community, shared by Charlotte County and Sarasota County in Florida.   This picturesque little town is the gateway to Charlotte Counties beautiful pristine Beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. You have not lived until you jump into the beautiful green/blue water of the Gulf and watch dolphins, manatees and even manta rays swimming by you  (Don't touch them please, our nature friends are very sensitive)   The string of beaches include Stump Pass Beach, Englewood Beach,  Blind Pass--to us locals, that would be middle beach--and Manasota Beach.   I think Dr. Beach has never named any of our beaches on the top ten list, because he wants to keep them a secret to himself!!!  Who knows, I could be right about that!   

Oh, by the way, The Secret Society of The Smoked Mullets was started in 1996 when Englewood Florida Chamber President Nita Edmondson (Cole) was looking for a special recognition award for those in the Englewood community who had contributed to the area's successes, but may never have been recognized.  The name originated from Englewood's famous dish: the smoked mullet. Historical tales say when the mullet ran in Lemon Bay in the early days, they literally jumped into the rowboats, and "got tangled up in the ladies petticoats."  Anyone can be nominated, but past generations are given priority. Only the past winners can bring the names to the nomination meeting, and vote for the winners.  It's a lifetime honor to be chosen. Membership does not expire. (source, Englewood Chamber of Commerce)

                    Englewood still has the old Florida charm.  I love the drive down North Beach Road on Manasota Key.  Check out the shops on Dearborn Street and then watch the sun go down from the Lock & Key across from Chadwick Park on Englewood Beach.  I always feel relaxed in this coastal town.
