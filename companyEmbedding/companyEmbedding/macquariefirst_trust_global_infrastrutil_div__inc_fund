Macquarie/First Trust Global Infrastructure/Utilities Dividend and Income Fund (MFD)












MFD listed on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2004. It is a closed end fund which invests mainly in listed infrastructure and utilities companies in selected developed countries globally.
MFD�s objective is is to seek a high level of return consisting of dividends, interest etc while preserving capital and to manage investments and expenses so a significant portion of distributions are tax-advantaged.
The fund is advised by First Trust Advisers, a leading US financial services provider to unit investment trusts, and sub-advised by Macquarie.

VOTING



As described further in the proposal, for each Fund, the affirmative vote
of a plurality of the Shares present and entitled to vote at the Meeting will be
required to elect the specified nominees as the Class III Trustees of that Fund
provided a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., Shares
held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received
from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker
or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter) will
have no effect on the approval of the proposal.


If the enclosed proxy card is properly executed and returned in time to be
voted at the Meeting, the Shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance
with the instructions marked thereon, or, if no instructions are marked thereon,
will be voted in the discretion of the persons named on the proxy card.
Accordingly, unless instructions to the contrary are marked thereon, a properly
executed and returned proxy will be voted FOR the election of the specified
nominees as the Class III Trustees and at the discretion of the named proxies on
any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting, as deemed
appropriate. Any shareholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke it at
any time prior to its exercise either by attending the Meeting and voting his or
her Shares in person, or by timely submitting a letter of revocation or a
later-dated proxy to the applicable Fund at its address above. A list of
shareholders entitled to notice of and to be present and to vote at the Meeting
will be available at 120 East Liberty Drive, Suite 400, Wheaton, Illinois 60187
for inspection by any shareholder during regular business hours prior to the
Meeting. Shareholders will need to show valid identification and proof of Share
ownership to be admitted to the Meeting or to inspect the list of shareholders.


Under the By-Laws of each Fund, a quorum is constituted by the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of thirty-three and one-third percent
(33-1/3%) of the voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on a
matter. For the purposes of establishing whether a quorum is present with
respect to a Fund, all Shares present and entitled to vote, including
abstentions and broker non-votes, shall be counted. Any meeting of shareholders
may be postponed prior to the meeting with notice to the shareholders entitled
to vote at that meeting. Any meeting of shareholders may, by action of the
chairman of the meeting, be adjourned to permit further solicitation of proxies
without further notice with respect to one or more matters to be considered at
such meeting to a designated time and place, whether or not a quorum is present
with respect to such matter. In addition, upon motion of the chairman of the
meeting, the question of adjournment may be submitted to a vote of the
shareholders, and in that case, any adjournment must be approved by the vote of
holders of a majority of the Shares present and entitled to vote with respect to
the matter or matters adjourned, and without further notice. Unless a proxy is
otherwise limited in this regard, any Shares present and entitled to vote at a
meeting, including broker non-votes, may, at the discretion of the proxies named
therein, be voted in favor of such an adjournment.

1   The Shares of each of the Funds are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") except for the Shares of First Trust Energy Income and Growth Fund,
which are listed on the NYSE MKT LLC ("NYSE MKT").


Shareholders of record on the Record Date are entitled to one vote for
each full Share the shareholder owns and a proportionate fractional vote for any
fraction of a Share the shareholder owns.


To the knowledge of the Board of Trustees of each Fund, as of the Record
Date, no single shareholder or "group" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act")) beneficially owned more
than 5% of the Fund's outstanding Shares, except as described in the following
table. A control person is one who owns, either directly or indirectly, more
than 25% of the voting securities of a Fund or acknowledges the existence of
control. A party that controls a Fund may be able to significantly affect the
outcome of any item presented to shareholders for approval. Information as to
beneficial ownership of Shares, including percentage of outstanding Shares
beneficially owned, is based on securities position listing reports as of the
Record Date and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") by shareholders. The Funds do not have any knowledge of the identity of
the ultimate beneficiaries of the Shares listed below.

PROPOSAL: ELECTION OF TWO (2) CLASS III TRUSTEES OF EACH FUND



TWO (2) CLASS III TRUSTEES ARE TO BE ELECTED BY HOLDERS OF SHARES OF EACH FUND.
CURRENT TRUSTEES JAMES A. BOWEN AND NIEL B. NIELSON ARE THE NOMINEES FOR
ELECTION AS THE CLASS III TRUSTEES BY SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH FUND FOR A THREE-YEAR
TERM.


Each Fund has established a staggered Board of Trustees pursuant to its
By-Laws, and, accordingly, Trustees are divided into the following three (3)
classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. James A. Bowen and Niel B. Nielson are
currently the Class III Trustees of each Fund for a term expiring at the Meeting
or until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If elected, Mr.
Bowen and Mr. Nielson will hold office for a three-year term expiring at each
Fund's 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Robert F. Keith, Richard E. Erickson
and Thomas R. Kadlec are current and continuing Trustees. Mr. Keith is the Class
I Trustee for a term expiring at each Fund's 2017 annual meeting of
shareholders. Dr. Erickson and Mr. Kadlec are Class II Trustees for a term
expiring at each Fund's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. Each Trustee serves
until his successor is elected and qualified, or until he earlier resigns or is
otherwise removed.


REQUIRED VOTE: For each Fund, each nominee for election as a Class III
Trustee must be elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of
the Shares of the Fund, cast in person or by proxy at the Meeting and entitled
to vote thereon, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will have no effect on the approval of the proposal. Proxies cannot be voted for
a greater number of persons than the number of seats open for election.


Unless you give contrary instructions on your proxy card, your Shares will
be voted FOR the election of each nominee listed if your proxy card has been
properly executed and timely received by the applicable Fund. If either nominee
should withdraw or otherwise become unavailable for election prior to the
Meeting, the proxies named on your proxy card intend to vote FOR any substitute
nominee recommended by the Funds' Boards of Trustees in accordance with the
Funds' procedures.



THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF EACH FUND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS

VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH NOMINEE.

MANAGEMENT




MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS



The general supervision of the duties performed for each Fund under its
respective investment management agreement with the Advisor is the
responsibility of that Fund's Board of Trustees. The Trustees set broad policies
for the Funds and choose the Funds' officers. The following is a list of the
Trustees and executive officers of each Fund and a statement of their present
positions and principal occupations during the past five years, the number of
portfolios each Trustee oversees and the other directorships each Trustee holds,
if applicable. As noted above, each Fund has established a staggered Board of
Trustees consisting of five (5) Trustees divided into three (3) classes: Class
I, Class II and Class III. The length of the term of office of each Trustee is
generally three years, and when each Trustee's term begins and ends depends on
the Trustee's designated class. The officers of the Funds serve indefinite
terms. James A. Bowen is deemed an "interested person" (as that term is defined
in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act")) ("Interested
Trustee") of the Funds due to his position as Chief Executive Officer of the
Advisor. Except for Mr. Bowen, each Trustee is not an "interested person" (as
that term is defined in the 1940 Act) and is therefore referred to as an
"Independent Trustee."

UNITARY BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE



The same five persons serve as Trustees on each Fund's Board of Trustees
and on the boards of all other funds in the First Trust Fund Complex (the "First
Trust Funds"), which is known as a "unitary" board leadership structure. The
unitary board structure was adopted for the First Trust Funds because of the
efficiencies it achieves with respect to the governance and oversight of the
First Trust Funds. Each First Trust Fund is subject to the rules and regulations
of the 1940 Act (and other applicable securities laws), which means that many of
the First Trust Funds face similar issues with respect to certain of their
fundamental activities, including risk management, portfolio liquidity,
portfolio valuation and financial reporting. In addition, all of the First Trust
Funds that are closed-end funds (the "First Trust Closed-end Funds") are managed
by the Advisor and, except for First Trust Intermediate Duration Preferred &
Income Fund and one other First Trust Closed-end Fund, they employ common


-13-





service providers for custody, fund accounting, administration and transfer
agency that provide substantially similar services to the First Trust Closed-end
Funds pursuant to substantially similar contractual arrangements. Because of the
similar and often overlapping issues facing the First Trust Funds, including
among the First Trust Closed-end Funds, the Board of Trustees of each of the
First Trust Funds (such Boards of Trustees referred to herein collectively as
the "Board") believes that maintaining a unitary board structure promotes
efficiency and consistency in the governance and oversight of all First Trust
Funds and reduces the costs, administrative burdens and possible conflicts that
may result from having multiple boards. In adopting a unitary board structure,
the Trustees seek to provide effective governance through establishing a board
the overall composition of which will, as a body, possess the appropriate
skills, diversity, independence and experience to oversee the business of the
First Trust Funds.


Annually, the Board reviews its governance structure and the committee
structures, their performance and functions and reviews any processes that would
enhance Board governance over the Funds' business. The Board has determined that
its leadership structure, including the unitary board and committee structure,
is appropriate based on the characteristics of the funds it serves and the
characteristics of the First Trust Fund Complex as a whole. The Board is
composed of four Independent Trustees and one Interested Trustee. The Interested
Trustee serves as the Chairman of the Board of each Fund. An individual who is
not a Trustee serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of each Fund.


In order to streamline communication between the Advisor and the
Independent Trustees and create certain efficiencies, the Board has a Lead
Independent Trustee who is responsible for: (i) coordinating activities of the
Independent Trustees; (ii) working with the Advisor, Fund counsel and the
independent legal counsel to the Independent Trustees to determine the agenda
for Board meetings; (iii) serving as the principal contact for and facilitating
communication between the Independent Trustees and the Funds' service providers,
particularly the Advisor; and (iv) any other duties that the Independent
Trustees may delegate to the Lead Independent Trustee. The Lead Independent
Trustee is selected by the Independent Trustees and serves a three-year term or
until his successor is selected. Thomas R. Kadlec currently serves as the Lead
Independent Trustee.


The Board has established four standing committees (as described below)
and has delegated certain of its responsibilities to those committees. The Board
and its committees meet frequently throughout the year to oversee the Funds'
activities, review contractual arrangements with and performance of service
providers, oversee compliance with regulatory requirements, and review Fund
performance. The Independent Trustees are represented by independent legal
counsel at all Board and committee meetings other than meetings of the Executive
Committee. Generally, the Board acts by majority vote of all the Trustees,
except where a different vote is required by applicable law.


The three committee chairmen and the Lead Independent Trustee currently
rotate every three years in serving as Chairman of the Audit Committee, the
Nominating and Governance Committee or the Valuation Committee, or as Lead
Independent Trustee. The Lead Independent Trustee and the immediate past Lead
Independent Trustee also serve on the Executive Committee with the Interested
Trustee.


In addition to the Funds, the First Trust Fund Complex includes: three
closed-end funds advised by First Trust Advisors; First Trust Series Fund, an
open-end management investment company with four portfolios advised by First
Trust Advisors; First Trust Variable Insurance Trust, an open-end management
investment company with three portfolios advised by First Trust Advisors; and


-14-





First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund, First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund II, First
Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III, First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund IV, First Trust
Exchange-Traded Fund V, First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund VI, First Trust
Exchange-Traded Fund VII, First Trust Exchange-Traded AlphaDEX(R) Fund and First
Trust Exchange-Traded AlphaDEX(R) Fund II, each an exchange-traded fund with 19,
14, 8, 8, 1, 10, 1, 21, and 19 portfolios (each such portfolio, an "ETF" and
each such exchange-traded fund, an "ETF Trust"), respectively, advised by First
Trust Advisors.


The four standing committees of the Board are: the Executive Committee
(and Dividend and Pricing Committee), the Nominating and Governance Committee,
the Valuation Committee and the Audit Committee. The Executive Committee, which
meets between Board meetings, is authorized to exercise all powers of and to act
in the place of the Board of Trustees to the extent permitted by each Fund's
Declaration of Trust and By-Laws. The members of the Executive Committee of a
Fund also serve as a special committee of the Board known as the Dividend and
Pricing Committee which is authorized to exercise all of the powers and
authority of the Board in respect of the issuance and sale, through an
underwritten public offering, of the Shares of the Fund and all other such
matters relating to such financing, including determining the price at which
such Shares are to be sold, approval of the final terms of the underwriting
agreement, and approval of the members of the underwriting syndicate. Such
Committee is also responsible for the declaration and setting of dividends. Mr.
Kadlec, Mr. Keith and Mr. Bowen are members of the Executive Committee. The
number of meetings of the Executive Committee held for each Fund during its last
fiscal year is shown on Schedule 1 hereto.


The Nominating and Governance Committee of each Fund is responsible for
appointing and nominating persons to the Board of Trustees of that Fund. Messrs.
Erickson, Kadlec, Keith and Nielson are members of the Nominating and Governance
Committee, and each is an Independent Trustee who is also an "independent
director" within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE or NYSE MKT,
as applicable. The Nominating and Governance Committee operates under a written
charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the
Funds' website at http://www.ftportfolios.com. If there is no vacancy on the
Board of Trustees of a Fund, the Board will not actively seek recommendations
from other parties, including shareholders. In 2014, the Board of Trustees
adopted a mandatory retirement age of 75 for Trustees, beyond which age Trustees
are ineligible to serve. The Nominating and Governance Committee Charter
provides that the Committee will not consider new trustee candidates who are 72
years of age or older or will turn 72 years old during the initial term. When a
vacancy on the Board of Trustees of a Fund occurs and nominations are sought to
fill such vacancy, the Nominating and Governance Committee may seek nominations
from those sources it deems appropriate in its discretion, including
shareholders of the applicable Fund. The Nominating and Governance Committee may
retain a search firm to identify candidates. To submit a recommendation for
nomination as a candidate for a position on the Board of Trustees of a Fund,
shareholders of the applicable Fund shall mail such recommendation to W. Scott
Jardine, Secretary, at 120 East Liberty Drive, Suite 400, Wheaton, Illinois
60187. Such recommendation shall include the following information: (i) evidence
of Fund ownership of the person or entity recommending the candidate (if a Fund
shareholder); (ii) a full description of the proposed candidate's background,
including their education, experience, current employment and date of birth;

(iii) names and addresses of at least three professional references for the
candidate; (iv) information as to whether the candidate is an "interested
person" in relation to the Fund, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act, and
such other information that may be considered to impair the candidate's
independence; and (v) any other information that may be helpful to the Committee
in evaluating the candidate (see also "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - SHAREHOLDER
PROPOSALS" below). If a recommendation is received with satisfactorily completed
information regarding a candidate during a time when a vacancy exists on the


-15-





Board or during such other time as the Nominating and Governance Committee is
accepting recommendations, the recommendation will be forwarded to the Chairman
of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the counsel to the Independent
Trustees. Recommendations received at any other time will be kept on file until
such time as the Nominating and Governance Committee is accepting
recommendations, at which point they may be considered for nomination. In
connection with the evaluation of candidates, the review process may include,
without limitation, personal interviews, background checks, written submissions
by the candidates and third party references. Under no circumstances shall the
Nominating and Governance Committee evaluate nominees recommended by a
shareholder of a Fund on a basis substantially different than that used for
other nominees for the same election or appointment of Trustees. The number of
meetings of the Nominating and Governance Committee held for each Fund during
its last fiscal year is shown on Schedule 1 hereto.


The Valuation Committee of each Fund is responsible for the oversight of
the valuation procedures of that Fund (the "Valuation Procedures"), for
determining the fair value of that Fund's securities or other assets under
certain circumstances as described in the Valuation Procedures, and for
evaluating the performance of any pricing service for that Fund. Messrs.
Erickson, Kadlec, Keith and Nielson are members of the Valuation Committee. The
number of meetings of the Valuation Committee held for each Fund during its last
fiscal year is shown on Schedule 1 hereto.


The Audit Committee of each Fund is responsible for overseeing that Fund's
accounting and financial reporting process, the system of internal controls,
audit process and evaluating and appointing independent auditors (subject also
to Board approval). The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted
and approved by the Board, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto, and
is available on the Funds' website at http://www.ftportfolios.com. Messrs.
Erickson, Kadlec, Keith and Nielson, all of whom are "independent directors"
within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE or NYSE MKT, as
applicable, serve on the Audit Committee. Messrs. Kadlec and Keith have each
been determined to qualify as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert" as such term
is defined in Form N-CSR. The number of meetings of the Audit Committee held for
each Fund during its last fiscal year is shown in Schedule 1 hereto.


In carrying out its responsibilities, as described below under
"INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' FEES--Pre-Approval," the Audit Committee pre-approves all
audit services and permitted non-audit services for each Fund (including the
fees and terms thereof) and non-audit services to be performed for the Advisor
by Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte & Touche"), the Funds' independent
registered public accounting firm ("independent auditors"), if the engagement
relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds.



RISK OVERSIGHT



As part of the general oversight of each Fund, the Board is involved in
the risk oversight of the Funds. The Board has adopted and periodically reviews
policies and procedures designed to address the Funds' risks. Oversight of
investment and compliance risk, including oversight of sub-advisors, is
performed primarily at the Board level in conjunction with the Advisor's
investment oversight group and the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO").
Oversight of other risks also occurs at the Committee level. The Advisor's
investment oversight group reports to the Board at quarterly meetings regarding,
among other things, Fund performance and the various drivers of such performance
as well as information related to sub-advisors and their operations and
processes. The Board reviews reports on the Funds' and the service providers'
compliance policies and procedures at each quarterly Board meeting and receives


-16-





an annual report from the CCO regarding the operations of the Funds' and the
service providers' compliance program. In addition, the Independent Trustees
meet privately each quarter with the CCO. The Audit Committee reviews with the
Advisor the Funds' major financial risk exposures and the steps the Advisor has
taken to monitor and control these exposures, including the Funds' risk
assessment and risk management policies and guidelines. The Audit Committee
also, as appropriate, reviews in a general manner the processes other Board
committees have in place with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
The Nominating and Governance Committee monitors all matters related to the
corporate governance of the Funds. The Valuation Committee monitors valuation
risk and compliance with the Funds' Valuation Procedures and oversees the
pricing services and actions by the Advisor's Pricing Committee with respect to
the valuation of portfolio securities.


Not all risks that may affect the Funds can be identified nor can controls
be developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. It may not be
practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, the
processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their
effectiveness, and some risks are simply beyond the reasonable control of the
Funds or the Advisor or other service providers. For instance, as the use of
Internet technology has become more prevalent, the Funds and their service
providers have become more susceptible to potential operational risks through
breaches in cyber security (generally, intentional and unintentional events that
may cause a Fund or a service provider to lose proprietary information, suffer
data corruption or lose operational capacity). There can be no guarantee that
any risk management systems established by the Funds, their service providers,
or issuers of the securities in which the Funds invest to reduce cyber security
risks will succeed, and the Funds cannot control such systems put in place by
service providers, issuers or other third parties whose operations may affect
the Funds and/or their shareholders. Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain
risks (such as investment related risks) to achieve a Fund's goals. As a result
of the foregoing and other factors, the Funds' ability to manage risk is subject
to substantial limitations.



BOARD DIVERSIFICATION AND TRUSTEE QUALIFICATIONS



As described above, the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board
oversees matters related to the nomination of Trustees. The Nominating and
Governance Committee seeks to establish an effective Board with an appropriate
range of skills and diversity, including, as appropriate, differences in
background, professional experience, education, vocations, and other individual
characteristics and traits in the aggregate. Each Trustee must meet certain
basic requirements, including relevant skills and experience, time availability,
and if qualifying as an Independent Trustee, independence from the Advisor,
sub-advisors, underwriters or other service providers, including any affiliates
of these entities.


Listed below for each current Trustee and the nominees are the
experiences, qualifications and attributes that led to the conclusion, as of the
date of this Joint Proxy Statement, that each current Trustee and the nominees
should serve as a trustee.

ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS



The Board seeks to have as many Trustees as possible in attendance at
annual meetings of shareholders. The policy of the Nominating and Governance
Committee relating to attendance by Trustees at annual meetings of shareholders
is contained in the Funds' Nominating and Governance Committee Charter, which is
available on each Fund's website located at http://www.ftportfolios.com. In
addition, the Board's attendance at last year's annual shareholder meeting is
available on each Fund's website located at http://www.ftportfolios.com. To find
the Board's attendance, select your Fund under the "Closed-End Funds" tab,
select the "News & Literature" link, and go to the "Shareholder Updates and
Information" heading.






AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT



The role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Trustees in its
oversight of the Funds' accounting and financial reporting process. The Audit
Committee operates pursuant to a charter (the "Charter") that was most recently
reviewed by the Board of Trustees on December 7, 2015, a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit A hereto, and is available on the Funds' website located at
http://www.ftportfolios.com. As set forth in the Charter, management of the
Funds is responsible for maintaining appropriate systems for accounting and
internal controls and the audit process. The Funds' independent auditors are
responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits of each Fund's financial
statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


In performing its oversight function, the Audit Committee reviewed and
discussed with management and the independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP,
the audited financial statements of the First Trust Mortgage Income Fund, the
First Trust Strategic High Income Fund II, the First Trust High Income
Long/Short Fund, the First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund, the First Trust
Intermediate Duration Preferred & Income Fund and the First Trust New
Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 at a
meeting held on December 21, 2015; the Macquarie/First Trust Global
Infrastructure/Utilities Dividend & Income Fund, the First Trust Energy Income
and Growth Fund, the First Trust Specialty Finance and Financial Opportunities
Fund and the First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2015 at a meeting held on January 21, 2016; and the First Trust
Enhanced Equity Income Fund, the First Trust/Aberdeen Global Opportunity Income
Fund and the First Trust/Aberdeen Emerging Opportunity Fund for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 at a meeting held on February 22, 2016, and discussed
the audits of such financial statements with the independent auditors and
management.


In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors
the accounting principles applied by the Funds and such other matters brought to
the attention of the Audit Committee by the independent auditors as required by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No.
16, Communications with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee also received from
the independent auditors the written disclosures and letter required by PCAOB
Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees
Concerning Independence, delineating relationships between the independent
auditors and the Funds and discussed the impact that any such relationships may
have on the objectivity and independence of the independent auditors.

The members of the Funds' Audit Committee are not full-time employees of
the Funds and are not performing the functions of auditors or accountants. As
such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members
to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or
procedures or to set auditor independence standards. Members of the Funds' Audit
Committee necessarily rely on the information provided to them by Fund
management and the independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's
considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audits
of the Funds' financial statements have been carried out in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that
the independent auditors are in fact "independent."


Based on its consideration of each Fund's audited financial statements and
the discussions referred to above with Fund management and Deloitte & Touche
LLP, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the
Audit Committee as set forth in the Charter and discussed above, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board the inclusion of each Fund's audited
financial statements in each Fund's Annual Report to Shareholders for the years
ended October 31, November 30 and December 31, 2015, respectively.


Submitted by the Audit Committee of each Fund:

Niel B. Nielson

Richard E. Erickson

Thomas R. Kadlec

Robert F. Keith



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' FEES



Deloitte & Touche has been selected to serve as the independent auditors
for each Fund for its current fiscal year, and acted as the independent auditors
for each Fund for its most recently completed fiscal year. Deloitte & Touche has
advised the Funds that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, Deloitte &
Touche professionals did not have any direct or material indirect ownership
interest in the Funds inconsistent with independent professional standards
pertaining to independent registered public accounting firms. Representatives of
Deloitte & Touche are not expected to be present at the Meeting, but will have
the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be
available should any matter arise requiring their presence. In reliance on Rule
32a-4 under the 1940 Act, each Fund is not seeking shareholder ratification of
the selection of Deloitte & Touche as independent auditors.

Pre-Approval



Pursuant to its Charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee of each Fund is responsible for the pre-approval of
all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and
terms thereof) to be performed for each Fund by its independent auditors. The
Chairman of the Audit Committee is authorized to give such pre-approvals on
behalf of the Audit Committee up to $25,000 and report any such pre-approval to
the full Audit Committee.


The Audit Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the
independent auditors' engagements for non-audit services with the Advisor and
any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Advisor
that provides ongoing services to the respective Fund, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds, subject to the
de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditors have provided non-audit services to
the Advisor or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control
with the Advisor that provides ongoing services to the respective Fund that were
not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Audit Committee will consider
whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible with the
auditors' independence.


None of the Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees, or All Other Fees,
if any, or the Aggregate Non-Audit Fees disclosed above that were required to be
pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to its Pre-Approval Policy were
pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the pre-approval exceptions
included in Regulation S-X.


Because the Audit Committee has not been informed of any such services,
the Audit Committee of each Fund has not considered whether the provision of
non-audit services that were rendered to the Advisor and any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the Advisor that provides ongoing
services to the respective Fund that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph

(c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the
principal accountant's independence.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION







SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS



Shareholder Proposals for Inclusion in a Fund's Proxy Statement. To be
considered for presentation at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders of a Fund
and included in the Fund's proxy statement relating to such meeting, a
shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act must be
received at the principal executive offices of the applicable Fund not later
than November 15, 2016. Such a proposal will be included in the Fund's proxy
statement if it meets the requirements of Rule 14a-8. Timely submission of a
proposal does not mean that such proposal will be included in a Fund's proxy
statement.


Other Shareholder Proposals. In addition to any requirements of law,
including the proxy rules under the 1934 Act, under the Funds' By-Laws, any
proposal to elect any person nominated by shareholders for election as Trustee
and any other proposals by shareholders may only be brought before an annual
meeting of a Fund if timely written notice (the "Shareholder Notice") is
provided to the Secretary of the Fund and the other conditions summarized below
are met. In accordance with the advance notice provisions included in the Funds'
By-Laws, unless a greater or lesser period is required under applicable law, to
be timely, the Shareholder Notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at
the Fund's principal executive offices, Attn: W. Scott Jardine, Secretary, not
less than forty-five (45) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the first
anniversary date of the date of the proxy statement released to shareholders for
the preceding year's annual meeting. However, if and only if the annual meeting
is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty (30) days
before the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year
and ends thirty (30) days after such anniversary date (an annual meeting date
outside such period being referred to herein as an "Other Annual Meeting Date"),
such Shareholder Notice must be given as described above by the later of the
close of business on (i) the date forty-five (45) days prior to such Other
Annual Meeting Date or (ii) the tenth (10th) business day following the date
such Other Annual Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed.


Any shareholder submitting a nomination of any person or persons (as the
case may be) for election as a Trustee or Trustees of a Fund is required to
deliver, as part of such Shareholder Notice: (i) a statement in writing setting
forth: (A) the name, age, date of birth, business address, residence address and
nationality of the person or persons to be nominated; (B) the class or series
and number of all Shares of the Fund owned of record or beneficially by each
such person or persons, as reported to such shareholder by such nominee(s); (C)
any other information regarding each such person required by paragraphs (a),

(d), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K or paragraph (b) of Item 22 of
Rule 14a-101 (Schedule 14A) under the 1934 Act (or any successor provision
thereto); (D) any other information regarding the person or persons to be
nominated that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other
filings required to be made in connection with solicitation of proxies for
election of trustees or directors pursuant to Section 14 of the 1934 Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (E) whether such shareholder
believes any nominee is or will be an "interested person" of the Fund (as
defined in the 1940 Act) and, if not an "interested person," information
regarding each nominee that will be sufficient for the Fund to make such
determination; and (ii) the written and signed consent of any person nominated
to be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected. In addition, the
Trustees may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as
they may reasonably require or deem necessary to determine the eligibility of
such proposed nominee to serve as a Trustee.


-29-





Without limiting the foregoing, any shareholder who gives a Shareholder
Notice of any matter proposed to be brought before a shareholder meeting
(whether or not involving nominees for Trustees) is required to deliver, as part
of such Shareholder Notice: (i) the description of and text of the proposal to
be presented; (ii) a brief written statement of the reasons why such shareholder
favors the proposal; (iii) such shareholder's name and address as they appear on
the Fund's books; (iv) any other information relating to the shareholder that
would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required
to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies with respect to the
matter(s) proposed pursuant to Section 14 of the 1934 Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; (v) the class or series and number of all
Shares of the Fund owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder; (vi)
any material interest of such shareholder in the matter proposed (other than as
a shareholder); (vii) a representation that the shareholder intends to appear in
person or by proxy at the shareholder meeting to act on the matter(s) proposed;

(viii) if the proposal involves nominee(s) for Trustees, a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each proposed nominee
and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the
nomination(s) are to be made by the shareholder; and (ix) in the case of a
shareholder (a "Beneficial Owner") that holds Shares entitled to vote at the
meeting through a nominee or "street name" holder of record, evidence
establishing such Beneficial Owner's indirect ownership of, and entitlement to
vote, Shares at the meeting of shareholders. Shares "beneficially owned" means
all Shares which such person is deemed to beneficially own pursuant to Rules
13d-3 and 13d-5 under the 1934 Act.


In addition, the By-Laws provide that, unless required by federal law, no
matters shall be considered at or brought before any annual or special meeting
unless such matter has been deemed a proper matter for shareholder action by at
least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Trustees. Timely
submission of a proposal does not mean that such proposal will be brought before
the meeting.



SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS



Shareholders of a Fund who want to communicate with the Board of Trustees
or any individual Trustee should write the Fund to the attention of the Fund
Secretary, W. Scott Jardine. The letter should indicate that you are a Fund
shareholder. If the communication is intended for a specific Trustee and so
indicates, it will be sent only to that Trustee. If a communication does not
indicate a specific Trustee, it will be sent to the Chairman of the Nominating
and Governance Committee of the Board and the independent legal counsel to the
Independent Trustees for further distribution as deemed appropriate by such
persons.

EXHIBIT A




AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER



I.                  PURPOSE


The Audit Committee (the "Committee") is appointed by the Boards of
Trustees (the "Boards") of the investment companies (the "Funds") advised by
First Trust Advisors L.P. ("Fund Management") for the following purposes:


1. to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of
each Fund and its internal controls and, as the Audit Committee deems
appropriate, to inquire into the internal controls of certain third-party
service providers;


2. to oversee the quality and integrity of each Fund's financial
statements and the independent audit thereof;


3. to oversee, or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of, each
Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to
the Fund's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls and
independent audits; and


4. to approve, prior to the appointment, the engagement of each
Fund's independent auditor and, in connection therewith, to review and
evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the Fund's
independent auditor.


II.                 COMMITTEE ORGANIZATION AND COMPOSITION


A.     Size and Membership Requirements.


1. The Committee shall be composed of at least three members, all
of whom shall be trustees of the Funds. Each member of the Committee, and
a Committee chairperson, shall be appointed by the Board on the
recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee.


2. Each member of the Committee shall be independent of the Funds
and must be free of any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board,
would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a Committee
member. With respect to the Funds which are closed-end funds or open-end
exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), each member must meet the independence and
experience requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, NYSE
MKT LLC or the NASDAQ Stock Market (as applicable), and Section 10A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Rule
10A-3 thereunder, and other applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Included in the foregoing is
the requirement that no member of the Committee be an "interested person"
of the Funds within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), nor shall any Committee
member accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other
compensatory fee from the Funds (except in the capacity as a Board or
committee member).





3. At least one member of the Committee shall have been determined
by the Board, exercising its business judgment, to qualify as an "audit
committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC.


4. With respect to Funds whose shares are listed on NYSE Arca or on
the New York Stock Exchange, each member of the Committee shall have been
determined by the Board, exercising its business judgment, to be
"financially literate" as required by the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE
Arca (as applicable). In addition, at least one member of the Committee
shall have been determined by the Board, exercising its business judgment,
to have "accounting or related financial management expertise," as
required by the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE Arca (as applicable). Such
member may, but need not be, the same person as the Funds' "audit
committee financial expert." With respect to Funds that are closed-end
funds or ETFs whose shares are listed on the NYSE MKT LLC or the NASDAQ
Stock Market, each member of the Committee shall be able to read and
understand fundamental financial statements, including a Fund's balance
sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. In addition, at least one
member of the Committee shall have been determined by the Board,
exercising its business judgment, to be "financially sophisticated," as
required by the NYSE MKT LLC or the NASDAQ Stock Market (as applicable).
Any member whom the Board determines to be an "audit committee financial
expert" shall be presumed to qualify as financially sophisticated.


5. With respect to Funds that are closed-end funds or ETFs,
Committee members shall not serve simultaneously on the audit committee of
more than two public companies, in addition to their service on the
Committee.


B.     Frequency of Meetings.


The Committee will ordinarily meet once for every regular meeting of the
Board. The Committee may meet more or less frequently as appropriate, but no
less than four times per year.


C.     Term of Office.


Committee members shall serve until they resign or are removed or replaced
by the Board.


III.                RESPONSIBILITIES


A.     With respect to Independent Auditors:


1. The Committee shall be responsible for the appointment or
replacement (subject, if applicable, to Board and/or shareholder
ratification), compensation, retention and oversight of the work of any
registered public accounting firm engaged (including resolution of
disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial
reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or
performing other audit, review or attest services for the Funds ("External
Auditors"). The External Auditors shall report directly to the Committee.


2. The Committee shall meet with the External Auditors and Fund
Management to review the scope, fees, audit plans and staffing of the
proposed audits for each fiscal year. At the conclusion of the audit, the
Committee shall review such audit results, including the External
Auditors' evaluation of each Fund's financial and internal controls, any
comments or recommendations of the External Auditors, any audit problems


A-2





or difficulties and Fund Management's response, including any restrictions
on the scope of the External Auditors' activities or on access to
requested information, any significant disagreements with Fund Management,
any accounting adjustments noted or proposed by the auditor but not made
by the Fund, any communications between the audit team and the audit
firm's national office regarding auditing or accounting issues presented
by the engagement, any significant changes required from the originally
planned audit programs and any adjustments to the financial statements
recommended by the External Auditors.


3. The Committee shall meet with the External Auditors in the
absence of Fund Management, as necessary.


4. The Committee shall pre-approve all audit services and permitted
non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed
for each Fund by its External Auditors in accordance with the Audit and
Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy. The Chairman of the Committee is
authorized to give such pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee where the
fee for such engagement does not exceed the amount specified in the Audit
and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy, and shall report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.


5. The Committee shall pre-approve the External Auditors'
engagements for non-audit services to Fund Management and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Fund Management
that provides ongoing services to the Funds, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds, subject
to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01
of Regulation S-X. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give
such pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee, and shall report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.


6. If the External Auditors have provided non-audit services to
Fund Management and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with Fund Management that provides ongoing services to the Funds
that were not pre-approved pursuant to the de minimis exception, the
Committee shall consider whether the provision of such non-audit services
is compatible with the External Auditors' independence.


7. The Committee shall obtain and review a report from the External
Auditors at least annually (including a formal written statement
delineating all relationships between the auditors and the Funds
consistent with PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526) regarding (a) the
External Auditors' internal quality-control procedures; (b) any material
issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer
review, of the firm, or by an inquiry or investigation by governmental or
professional authorities within the preceding five years, respecting one
or more independent audits carried out by the firm; (c) any steps taken to
deal with any such issues; and (d) the External Auditors' independence,
including all relationships between the External Auditors and the Funds
and their affiliates; and evaluating the qualifications, performance and
independence of the External Auditors, including their membership in the
SEC practice section of the AICPA and their compliance with all applicable
requirements for independence and peer review, and a review and evaluation
of the lead partner, taking into account the opinions of management and
discussing such reports with the External Auditors. The Committee shall
present its conclusions with respect to the External Auditors to the
Board.


A-3





8. The Committee shall review reports and other information
provided to it by the External Auditors regarding any illegal acts that
the External Auditors should discover (whether or not perceived to have a
material effect on a Fund's financial statements), in accordance with and
as required by Section 10A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.


9. The Committee shall ensure the rotation of the lead (or
concurring) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and
the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit as required by law,
and further consider the rotation of the independent auditor firm itself.


10. The Committee shall establish and recommend to the Board for
ratification a policy of the Funds with respect to the hiring of employees
or former employees of the External Auditors who participated in the
audits of the Funds' financial statements.


11. The Committee shall take (and, where appropriate, recommend that
the Board take) appropriate action to oversee the independence of the
External Auditors.


12. The Committee shall report regularly to the Board on the results
of the activities of the Committee, including any issues that arise with
respect to the quality or integrity of the Funds' financial statements,
the Funds' compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, the
performance and independence of the Funds' External Auditors, or the
performance of the internal audit function, if any.


B.     With respect to Fund Financial Statements:


1. The Committee shall meet to review and discuss with Fund
Management and the External Auditors the annual audited financial
statements of the Funds, major issues regarding accounting and auditing
principles and practices, and the Funds' disclosures under "Management's
Discussion and Analysis," and shall meet to review and discuss with Fund
Management the semi-annual financial statements of the Funds and the
Funds' disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis."


2. The Committee shall review and discuss reports, both written and
oral, from the External Auditors or Fund Management regarding (a) all
critical accounting policies and practices to be used; (b) all alternative
treatments of financial information within generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") for policies and practices that have been discussed
with Fund Management, including the ramifications of the use of such
alternative treatments and disclosures and the treatment preferred by the
External Auditors; (c) other material written communications between the
External Auditors and Fund Management, such as any management letter or
schedule of unadjusted differences; and (d) all non-audit services
provided to any entity in the investment company complex (as defined in
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X) that were not pre-approved by the Committee.


3. The Committee shall review disclosures made to the Committee by
the Funds' principal executive officer and principal financial officer
during their certification process for the Funds' periodic reports about
any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls or material weaknesses therein and any fraud involving management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Funds' internal
controls.


A-4





4. The Committee shall discuss with the External Auditors the
matters required to be discussed by the applicable PCAOB Auditing Standard
that arise during the External Auditor's review of the Funds' financial
statements.


5. The Committee shall review and discuss with Fund Management and
the External Auditors (a) significant financial reporting issues and
judgments made in connection with the preparation and presentation of the
Funds' financial statements, including any significant changes in the
Funds' selection or application of accounting principles and any major
issues as to the adequacy of the Funds' internal controls and any special
audit steps adopted in light of material control deficiencies, and (b)
analyses prepared by Fund Management or the External Auditors setting
forth significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in
connection with the preparation of the financial statements, including
analyses of the effects of alternative GAAP methods on the financial
statements.


6. The Committee shall review and discuss with Fund Management and
the External Auditors the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives
on the Funds' financial statements.


7. The Committee shall discuss with Fund Management the Funds'
press releases regarding financial results and dividends, as well as
financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and
rating agencies. This discussion may be done generally, consisting of
discussing the types of information to be disclosed and the types of
presentations to be made. The Chairman of the Committee or any member of
the Committee also serving on the Dividend and Pricing Committee shall be
authorized to have these discussions with Fund Management on behalf of the
Committee, and shall report to the Committee regarding any such
discussions.


8. The Committee shall discuss with Fund Management the Funds'
major financial risk exposures and the steps Fund Management has taken to
monitor and control these exposures, including the Funds' risk assessment
and risk management policies and guidelines. In fulfilling its obligations
under this paragraph, the Committee may, as applicable, review in a
general manner the processes other Board committees have in place with
respect to risk assessment and risk management.


C.   With respect to serving as a Qualified Legal Compliance Committee:

reports of evidence of (a) a material violation of any federal or
state securities laws, (b) a material breach of a fiduciary duty
arising under any federal or state laws or (c) a similar material

(iii) After considering the Report of Material Violation, the
Committee shall do the following if it deems an investigation
necessary:

(4) Recommend, by majority vote, that the Fund implement
an appropriate response to evidence of a material violation;
and


(5) Inform the chief legal officer and the chief
executive officer (or the equivalents thereof) and the Board of
the results of any such investigation and the appropriate
remedial measures to be adopted.


2. The Committee shall take all other action that it deems
appropriate in the event that the Fund fails in any material respect to
implement an appropriate response that the Committee, as the QLCC, has
recommended the Fund take.


D.   Other Responsibilities:


1. The Committee shall receive, retain and handle complaints
received by the Funds regarding accounting, internal accounting controls,
or auditing matters from any person, whether or not an employee of the
Funds or Fund Management, and shall receive submissions of concerns
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters by officers of the
Funds and employees of Fund Management, any administrator, fund
accountant, principal underwriter, or any other provider of
accounting-related services for the Funds. All such complaints and
concerns shall be handled in accordance with the Committee's procedures
for operating as a QLCC, outlined in III.C above.


2. The Committee shall review, with fund counsel and independent
legal counsel, any legal matters that could have significant impact on a
Fund's financial statements or compliance policies and the findings of any
examination by a regulatory agency as they relate to financial statement
matters.


A-6

charter on an annual basis and provide a recommendation to the Board for
approval of any proposed changes deemed necessary or advisable by the
Committee.

of the Committee.


5. The Committee shall review with the External Auditors and with

accounting and financial controls.

External Auditors any correspondence with regulators or governmental
agencies that raise material issues regarding the Funds' financial
statements or accounting policies.


7. The Committee shall obtain any reports from Fund Management with
respect to the Funds' policies and procedures regarding compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. The Committee shall perform other special
reviews, investigations or oversight functions as requested by the Board
and shall receive and review periodic or special reports issued on
exposure/controls, irregularities and control failures related to the
Funds.


8. The Committee shall prepare any report of the Committee required
to be included in a proxy statement for a Fund.


9. The Committee may request any officer or employee of a Fund or
Fund Management, independent legal counsel, fund counsel and the External
Auditors to attend a meeting of the Committee or to meet with any members
of, or consultants to, the Committee.


10. The Committee shall maintain minutes of its meetings.


11. The Committee shall perform such other functions and have such
powers as may be necessary or appropriate in the efficient and lawful
discharge of its responsibilities.


IV.                 AUTHORITY TO ENGAGE ADVISERS


The Committee may engage independent counsel and other advisers, as it
determines necessary to carry out its duties. The Funds' External Auditors shall
have unrestricted accessibility at any time to Committee members.


V.                  FUNDING PROVISIONS


A. The Committee shall determine the:


1. Compensation to any independent registered public accounting

performing other audit, review or attest services for a Fund; and


2. Compensation to any advisers employed by the Committee.


A-7

appropriate administrative expenses of the Committee shall be paid by the
applicable Fund or Fund Management.


VI.                 MANAGEMENT AND EXTERNAL AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES


A. Fund Management has the primary responsibility for establishing and
maintaining systems for accounting, reporting, disclosure and internal controls.
The External Auditors have the primary responsibility to plan and implement an
audit, with proper consideration given to the accounting, reporting and internal
controls. All External Auditors engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing
an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the
Funds shall report directly to the Committee. The External Auditors' ultimate
accountability is to the Board and the Committee, as representatives of
shareholders.


B. While the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in
this Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or
to determine that the Funds' financial statements are complete and accurate and
are in accordance with GAAP, nor is it the duty of the Committee to assure
compliance with laws and regulations and/or the Funds' Code of Ethics.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


6
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


7
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations

Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

    The Fund principally invests in a global portfolio of infrastructure stocks in a range of currencies and senior secured loans.  
    Accordingly, the Fund's NAV will fluctuate with changes in the value of the Fund’s holdings. Investment in infrastructure and 
    utilities issuers are subject to various risks including governmental regulations, high interest costs associated with capital construction programs, 
    costs associated with environmental regulation, the effects of economic slowdown and surplus capacity, 
    competition from other providers of services and other factors. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency 
    fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries.


    The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are generally considered to be "high-yield securities". 
        High yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. 
        The Fund's portfolio is also subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities 
        will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. Credit risk is the risk of nonpayment of scheduled contractual repayments 
        whether interest and/or principal payments or payments for services and that the value of a security may decline as a result.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. 
       There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged 
       qualified dividend income.


    The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

							A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.

*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.

1.       VALUATION AND INVESTMENT PRACTICES                                     
PORTFOLIO VALUATION:                                                            

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based  
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets. The NAV is determined  
as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"),     
normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.      
Domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting
the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. The NAV is   
computed by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued     
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses and   
dividends declared but unpaid), by the total number of shares outstanding.      

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value, or in the absence of   
market value, with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value in        
accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. A        
majority of the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by   
third parties. In the event that market quotations are not readily available,   
the pricing service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the 
valuations are deemed unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the 
principal markets for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign    
securities), but before the Fund values its assets, would materially affect NAV,
First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value method in good   
faith to value the Fund's securities and investments. The use of fair value     
pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures approved by the Fund's  
Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.       
Foreign securities traded outside the United States are generally valued as of  
the time their trading is complete, which is usually different from the close of
the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the value of such securities may occur 
between such times and the close of the NYSE that will not be reflected in the  
computation of a Fund's NAV. If events materially affecting the value of such   
securities occur during such period, these securities will be valued at their   
fair value according to procedures decided upon in good faith by the Fund's     
Board of Trustees. All securities and other assets of the Fund initially        
expressed in foreign currencies will be converted to U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the time of valuation.                                       

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National      
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day of which
such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the      
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on    
such day. Securities trading on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official    
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded in the       
over-the-counter market, but excluding securities trading on the NASDAQ, are    
valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days 
or less are valued at amortized cost.                                           

The Senior Floating Rate Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund invests   
are not listed on any securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are   
typically bought and sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated 
private transactions that function in many respects like an over-the-counter    
secondary market, although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market,
while having substantially grown in the past several years, generally has fewer 
trades and less liquidity than the secondary market for other types of          
securities. Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and 
information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may 
be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans  
may be based on infrequent and dated information. Because there is less         
reliable, objective data available, elements of judgment may play a greater role
in valuation of Senior Loans than for other types of securities. Typically      
Senior Loans are valued using information provided by an independent third

party pricing service. If the pricing service cannot or does not provide a      
valuation for a particular Senior Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable,  
First Trust may value such Senior Loan at a fair value as determined in good    
faith under procedures approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in         
accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.                                 

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT:                                                           

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a     
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt   
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the 
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding  
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total 
amount of the repurchase obligations, including interest. In the event of       
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset    
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is   
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral    
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the        
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its      
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.                                                       

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS:                                                        

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and   
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.  

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be  
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income is not accrued    
until settlement date. The Fund instructs the custodian to segregate assets of  
the Fund with a current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued   
purchase commitments.                                                           

UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:                                                      

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the

 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats 2017




 



						Dividend Aristocrates						

							Compare the dividend stocks in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index by dividend yield, payout ratio, Price/Earnings, earnings per share (EPS), dividend per share (DPS).Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the S&P 500 that have increased dividend payouts to shareholders every year for the last 25 years. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats is the most prestigious list of dividend stocks, the top dividend stocks S&P 500. The Dividend Aristocrats index is a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index series.Only regular dividend payments will be considered when determining the calendar year total dividend payments of a company. Special cash dividends will not be considered for eligibility purposes on a historical and ongoing basis.Beware of stocks with an extremely high dividend yield! This can be caused by a stock price that is extremely low, compared to the trailing twelve months (ttm) dividend. Or it can be caused by a special, one-time only super dividend.Last updated: 2017/7/22 00:35:06 CET

Read moreAT&T: Is The High Yield Worth The Stagnant Stock Price?Overview In this article, I will be reviewing AT&T (NYSE: T) to determine if it is currently a good investment option for long term dividend growth investors. AT&T is a Dividend Aristocrat that has been increasing its dividend yearly since 1985. It is also the highest yielding aristocrat with a current dividend yield of 4.65%. AT&T has been a pretty good performing stock overall, but looking at the chart below, you can see that its stock price appreciation has been fairly... Read moreYes, You Can Still Build A 4% Yielding Portfolio In Today's Market, Part IILast April I presented a mock portfolio with a 4% yield to show that an income portfolio could still be built in an expensive market. Nearly a year later, the market continues to trade near all-time highs, leaving some investors once again wondering if the time is right to put more cash into investments. This article will take a look back at those picks to see what they are worth today, and also see how much income they are producing. It will also present a new dividend growth portfolio... Read moreThanks For The 8% Raise, Dividend Growth 50!The month just completed was quite an eventful one for yours truly. In a March 14 article, I told about my daughter Katie getting engaged, with her boyfriend popping the question while they were scuba diving in the waters off of Hawaii. Incredibly, 10 days later, my son Ben proposed to his girlfriend ... and she said yes.  The incredible part wasn't that Sammi said yes - Ben, after all, is a heck of a catch (and vice versa)! It was that two siblings announced two engagements less... Read moreThe Slowly, But Surely Dividend Income Portfolio - March 2017 UpdateAnother month up, another month down. It seems as though, as Steve Miller Band wrote several decades ago, time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' into the future. While we don't know what the future is going to hold, it's a fool's errand to do nothing to plan for it. If the entire world financial system collapses and we're bartering eggs for cloth in 30 years, everybody will pretty much be in the same boat, and humanity will adapt.  The above is not a terribly... Read moreMarch Portfolio Update: Our Dividend Growth Portfolio Powers HigherI love the month of March. March is usually the month where the weather starts to improve. The grass is turning green. The sun shines more and snow and cold weather are usually in the rearview mirror. As a sports fan, there's spring training baseball and the NCAA basketball tournament. Professional hockey and basketball leagues are heading towards the playoffs. Being a teacher, spring break is less than a week away. All in all, this is one of my favorite times of the year. This time around,... Read moreAT&T: The King Of All Dividend StocksImage Source: New York Times AT&T (NYSE: T) is one of those stocks that can be the anchor of any diversified portfolio. I put them in the same class as other blue-chip stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). AT&T is a consistent performer, recession resilient, and rewards shareholders with a whopping dividend (current yield of 4.69%). The recent DirecTV acquisition and pending Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) acquisition will allow... Read moreAT&T Declares Quarterly Dividend The board of directors of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.49 a share on the company’s common shares. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 10, 2017.... Read moreAT&T's Massive Acquisitions Are Taking Their Toll On The DividendPhoto credit AT&T (NYSE: T) is certainly a stock that people buy for the capital returns. After all, what good is a utility without a sizable dividend yield? The thing is that T has, in the past, done sizable capital returns via the other method - buybacks - and with some success. The seemingly constant big mergers that are occurring these days for T, however, have made it such that it cannot do buybacks as it once did. And as a result, I'm wondering aloud if T wouldn't be...
