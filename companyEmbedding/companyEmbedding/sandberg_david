David Goldberg, the CEO of Survey Monkey and the husband of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, has died. He was 47.
Goldberg's brother, Robert, announced the news Saturday morning on Facebook, saying David "passed away suddenly last night":


It’s with incredible shock and sadness that I’m letting our friends and family know that my amazing brother, Dave...
Posted by Robert Goldberg on Saturday, May 2, 2015

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg shared the post, adding, “Dave Goldberg was an amazing person and I am glad I got to know him. My thoughts and prayers are with Sheryl and her family.”
Twitter CEO Dick Costolo called the news “heartbreaking” in a tweet, and described Goldberg as “one of the truly great people on the planet … of almost unimaginably remarkable character.”

“Dave’s genius, courage and leadership were overshadowed only by his compassion, friendship and heart,” Survey Monkey said in a statement following the news. “His greatest love was for his family. Our sympathy goes out to them and to all who were touched by this extraordinary man. We are all heartbroken.”
Arianna Huffington also shared Robert's post on Facebook, adding, "So deeply saddened and shocked by the death of Dave Goldberg. I was blessed to get to know him through his beloved wife Sheryl and to see firsthand what an amazing father, son, innovator, and caring friend he was."
Recode's Kara Swisher mourned the "incomprehensible" loss with a remark on "His unfailing kindness toward everyone, endless generosity with his time, insights and advice and basic great-guy personality made Dave — no one called him David, really — the heart and also soul of the tech and media community."
Remembrances also poured in on social media Saturday:

Love your family + your friends. Be thoughtful. Work hard. Strive to improve. Help others. Dave Goldberg aced all of these. Love ya Goldie.

My friend @davegoldberg kindest, most generous, loving father, loyal husband, great ceo, & sweetest friend. May his memory be a blessing.
— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) May 2, 2015


Devastated to hear about loss of @davegoldberg. One of kindest & most generous friends I've known. My heart goes out to Sheryl & his family
— Jeff Weiner (@jeffweiner) May 2, 2015


RIP @davegoldberg. I have never known a more kind individual. You will be missed.
— David Doc Sands (@Doc_Sands) May 2, 2015


One of the things I admired most about @davegoldberg was his ability to balance being a husband and father with his work.
— Chris Yeh (@chrisyeh) May 2, 2015


I never heard anyone say a disparaging word about @davegoldberg. Ever. Almost unheard of when it comes to successful people in S. Valley
— danprimack (@danprimack) May 2, 2015

Goldberg rose to prominence in the tech industry in the 1990s, founding a company by the name of Launch Media in 1994, which he sold to Yahoo in 2001. He stayed on at Yahoo for six years, and then joined Benchmark Capital, where he served as an entrepreneur in residence.
He met Sheryl Sandberg in 1996, though the two didn’t start dating until 2002.
“We went out to dinner and a movie and hit it off. She fell asleep on my shoulder, which I thought was great," Goldberg recalled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 2013. "Turns out, I learned much later, she sleeps through every movie, on any shoulder that is available, but it worked on me at that moment of time."
In 2009, he headed to Survey Monkey and built it into a billion-dollar company, growing the staff from 14 to what is now 500, reports Business Insider. He had just celebrated his sixth anniversary at the company, calling it “one of [his] best decisions.”

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.

In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]
