Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2017 Earnings of $0.08 Per Diluted Share | Business Wire
























































Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2017 
      Earnings of $0.08 Per Diluted Share






July 25, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



JACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: ACFC):
    



Portfolio loans increased nearly $57 million since June 2016.


Deposits increased over $117 million during the last 12 months.


Other real estate owned (OREO) declined to less than $0.3 million 
        due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property.



      Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, 
      NASDAQ: ACFC), the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), 
      today reported earnings per diluted share of $0.08 and $0.17 for the 
      three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared with 
      earnings of $0.09 and $0.19 for the three and six months ended June 30, 
      2016, respectively.
    

      Commenting on the Company's results, John K. Stephens, Jr., President 
      and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Atlantic Coast again delivered a 
      solid financial and operational performance in the second quarter of 
      2017, driven by continued momentum in portfolio lending and deposit 
      growth. These increases underscore the success of our strategy to shift 
      to a commercial business banking franchise and to expand our platform to 
      attractive new markets in central Florida, while we continue to 
      capitalize on our increasing standing in all of our markets. At the same 
      time, we are pleased to note overall credit quality remained stable, 
      while the sale of our last significant foreclosed property resulted in 
      the lowest level of OREO in more than 10 years. Looking forward, our 
      pipelines and new business development efforts are robust and we remain 
      excited about the growth opportunities within our footprint, especially 
      considering our growing focus on commercial lending. I believe our 
      strengths position us well to achieve our aspirational goals and we have 
      the team, talent and tools needed to do so."
    

      Other significant highlights of the second quarter and first half of 
      2017 included:
    


        Net interest income improved to $6.7 million and $13.0 million for the 
        three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, from $6.4 
        million and $12.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 
        2016, respectively. Net interest margin was 3.19% for each of the 
        three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, up from 3.06% 
        and 3.03% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 
        respectively.
      

        Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and 
        warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 8% to $788.2 million at 
        June 30, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016, and 4% from 
        $758.6 million at June 30, 2016. The Company's loan growth since both 
        June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased 
        commercial real estate lending in all of its markets. This growth was 
        somewhat offset by portfolio mortgage loan sales as part of the 
        Company's interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies.
      



        Deposits increased 10% to $687.8 million at June 30, 2017, from $628.4 
        million at December 31, 2016, and 21% from $570.5 million at June 30, 
        2016. Deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased 16% to $647.4 
        million at June 30, 2017, from $558.0 million at December 31, 2016, 
        and 25% from $517.0 million at June 30, 2016. Wholesale funding, which 
        includes brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, 
        decreased 33% to $172.8 million at June 30, 2017, from $259.2 million 
        at December 31, 2016, and 45% from $315.1 million at June 30, 2016. 
        The increase in non-brokered deposits, and resulting decreased 
        reliance on wholesale funding, was driven primarily by the Company's 
        commercial deposit strategies put in place during 2016.
      

        Total assets increased to $912.6 million at June 30, 2017, from $907.5 
        million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio 
        loans, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash 
        equivalents, investment securities and other loans (loans 
        held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment), and decreased 
        from $921.8 million at June 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in 
        investment securities and other loans, which were partially offset by 
        an increase in portfolio loans and cash and cash equivalents.
      

        Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were 1.10% at 
        June 30, 2017, compared with 1.44% at December 31, 2016, and 0.67% at 
        June 30, 2016. Because of the Company's generally stable credit 
        quality throughout 2016 and continuing through the first half of 2017 
        due to an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to 
        nonperforming, the Company was able to reduce its loan loss provision 
        for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with the 
        same periods in 2016, while maintaining, in management's view, an 
        adequate ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total 
        portfolio loans.
      

        The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets 
        and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 12.94% and 
        10.06%, respectively, at June 30, 2017, and each continued to exceed 
        the levels – 10% and 5%, respectively – currently required for the 
        Bank to be considered well-capitalized.
      


      Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
      added, "Improving net interest margin for both the second quarter and 
      year-to-date period compared with the same periods last year again 
      highlights our operational performance and momentum. With respect to 
      margin, we were pleased to achieve 13 and 16 basis point improvements, 
      respectively, as we continue to reduce our total cost of funds and grow 
      higher-yielding assets. However, competitive conditions continue to be a 
      factor in pricing both loans and deposits and is something that we 
      continually monitor regarding its impact on margin going forward. While 
      all banks are subject to similar pricing issues, we remain confident in 
      Atlantic Coast's specific strategies to drive long-term growth and 
      improved shareholder value."

      The year-over-year increase in capital ratios at June 30, 2017 was due 
      primarily to an increase in capital related to higher earnings over the 
      past year. The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at June 30, 
      2017, compared with December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in 
      risk-weighted assets, due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in 
      cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as an 
      increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories.

(1)



          Includes $7.8 million, $7.9 million, and $0.8 million of 
          nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and June 
          30, 2016, respectively.
        





           
        



      While nonperforming assets have declined for three consecutive quarters, 
      the current level exceeded that of the year-earlier period, reflecting 
      the reclassification of two specific loans to nonperforming status 
      during the third quarter of 2016. That aside, the Company's overall 
      credit quality remains stable as the general pace of loans reclassified 
      to nonperforming remained slow during the last 12 months. Importantly, 
      OREO declined significantly as of June 30, 2017, compared with that at 
      June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a $2.4 
      million foreclosed property in May 2017.

      The Company's provision for portfolio loan losses has trended within a 
      relatively narrow range over the past year. It was slightly lower for 
      the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with the second quarter 
      last year, and was down 17% for the first six months ended June 30, 
      2017, versus the first half of 2016. This reflects a trend of solid 
      economic conditions in the Company's markets, which has led to continued 
      low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months. The increase in 
      the allowance for portfolio loan losses at June 30, 2017, compared with 
      that at June 30, 2016, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which 
      reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that 
      were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and 
      increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and 
      home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan 
      losses at June 30, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio 
      loans as of the end of the period.
    

      Net charge-offs remained at a low level during the three and six months 
      ended June 30, 2017, but were higher compared with the same periods in 
      2016 and during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to 
      the charge-off of one home equity loan and one commercial loan.

      The increase in net interest margin during the three and six months 
      ended June 30, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three and 
      six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates 
      paid on borrowed funds. Also contributing to the increase in net 
      interest margin was an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets 
      outstanding, reflecting the Company's ongoing redeployment of excess 
      liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and 
      warehouse loans held-for-investment. The slight decrease in net interest 
      margin during the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with net 
      interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflected an 
      increase in rates paid on funds, as well as a decrease in the yield 
      earned on loans and investment securities.

      The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 
      2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 
      March 31, 2017, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of loans 
      held-for-sale associated with the volatility in U.S. Department of 
      Agriculture (USDA) lending and the related gains on the sale of USDA 
      loans, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of investment 
      securities. The decrease in noninterest income for the three months 
      ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 
      30, 2016, also reflected lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans. The 
      decrease in noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, 
      compared with that of the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily 
      reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities, lower gains 
      on the sale of portfolio loans and reduced service charges and fees, 
      partially offset by higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale.
    

      Noninterest expense decreased nominally during the three months ended 
      June 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 
      2016 and March 31, 2017. The increase in noninterest expense during the 
      six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the six months 
      ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected increased data processing 
      expenses associated with ongoing efforts to improve the Company's IT 
      infrastructure, as well as increased interchange expense and other 
      miscellaneous operating expenses.
    

      The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 
      2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2016, as 
      well as for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of 
      the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected a decline in 
      income before income tax expense, as well as a decrease in the effective 
      tax rate.

          Non-GAAP financial measure. Because the Company does not currently 
          have any intangible assets, tangible stockholders' equity is equal 
          to stockholders' equity, tangible assets is equal to assets, and 
          tangible book value is equal to book value. Accordingly, no 
          reconciliations are required for these measures.

Offices and Branches[edit]
Atlantic Coast Bank maintains offices throughout Central and North Florida and Southeast Georgia. The company operates seven branches and one administrative office (which includes a stand-alone ATM) in Northeast Florida and three branches in Southeast Georgia. The Northeast Florida branches include Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach, the southside of Jacksonville, the westside of Jacksonville, Arlington, Julington Creek and Orange Park. The Southeast Georgia branches include two in Waycross and one in Douglas. In addition, Atlantic Coast Bank has mortgage and commercial loan production offices in Orlando, Florida, Gainesville, Florida, Tampa, Florida, Saint Petersburg, Florida, Saint Simons Island, Georgia and Savannah, Georgia, and has an SBA & USDA Lending office in Orlando, Florida, which funds small business loans throughout the Southeast U.S.
Banking and Financial Services[edit]
Atlantic Coast Bank is a full service community bank operating three distinct lines of business: Commercial Banking, Retail (Branch) Banking, and Residential Mortgage Lending. The Bank's specific services include, but are not limited to, deposit accounts, mortgage loans, auto loans, personal loans, credit cards, commercial loans, USDA loans, SBA loans, warehouse lending, and wealth management.[3]
History[edit]
The bank first opened its doors in 1939 as Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union in Waycross, Georgia, servicing the employees of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.
In November 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank known as Atlantic Coast Federal. The conversion allowed Atlantic Coast Federal to diversify its customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses within its market areas.
In January 2003, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation was organized for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock that Atlantic Coast Federal issued upon its mutual holding company reorganization from the mutual to stock form of ownership. In October 2004, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation completed a minority stock offering in which it sold 5,819,000 shares, or 40%, of its common stock to eligible depositors and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s Employee Stock Option Plan. The remaining majority of the 14,547,500 outstanding shares were owned by Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC, a federally chartered mutual holding company.
In July 2006, Atlantic Coast Federal, now a federally chartered stock savings association, was renamed Atlantic Coast Bank, to better reflect the nature of its operations.
In February 2011, the second step of the conversion from the mutual holding company structure was completed, along with a related public offering. As a result of the conversion, Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, the holding companies of Atlantic Coast Bank, were merged into Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation. Atlantic Coast Bank is 100% owned by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, and Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is 100% owned by public stockholders (NASDAQ: ACFC).
In February 2013, Bond Street Holdings and its bank subsidiary, Florida Community Bank, attempted to acquire Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank. The deal was voted down by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation's shareholders in June 2013.
In November 2013, the Board hired John K. Stephens, Jr., as President and CEO, to initiate a recapitalization and turnaround strategy. In December 2013, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation raised $48.3 million in a public stock offering (Nasdaq: "ACFC") by issuing 12,880,000 shares of its common stock. Net proceeds from the public offering were $44.9 million, the majority of which was contributed to Atlantic Coast Bank to improve capital ratios, to support growth in the Bank's loan and investment portfolios, and for general corporate purposes. The company simultaneously divested the majority of its nonperforming assets, resulting in a recapitalized, clean balance sheet.
During 2014, the company started a residential mortgage lending group and restaffed its commercial bank. Additionally, in June 2015, the company restructured and refinanced over $160 million in long-term debt to reduce expenses and mitigate risk.

Offices and Branches[edit]
Atlantic Coast Bank maintains offices throughout Central and North Florida and Southeast Georgia. The company operates seven branches and one administrative office (which includes a stand-alone ATM) in Northeast Florida and three branches in Southeast Georgia. The Northeast Florida branches include Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach, the southside of Jacksonville, the westside of Jacksonville, Arlington, Julington Creek and Orange Park. The Southeast Georgia branches include two in Waycross and one in Douglas. In addition, Atlantic Coast Bank has mortgage and commercial loan production offices in Orlando, Florida, Gainesville, Florida, Tampa, Florida, Saint Petersburg, Florida, Saint Simons Island, Georgia and Savannah, Georgia, and has an SBA & USDA Lending office in Orlando, Florida, which funds small business loans throughout the Southeast U.S.
Banking and Financial Services[edit]
Atlantic Coast Bank is a full service community bank operating three distinct lines of business: Commercial Banking, Retail (Branch) Banking, and Residential Mortgage Lending. The Bank's specific services include, but are not limited to, deposit accounts, mortgage loans, auto loans, personal loans, credit cards, commercial loans, USDA loans, SBA loans, warehouse lending, and wealth management.[3]
History[edit]
The bank first opened its doors in 1939 as Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union in Waycross, Georgia, servicing the employees of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.
In November 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank known as Atlantic Coast Federal. The conversion allowed Atlantic Coast Federal to diversify its customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses within its market areas.
In January 2003, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation was organized for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock that Atlantic Coast Federal issued upon its mutual holding company reorganization from the mutual to stock form of ownership. In October 2004, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation completed a minority stock offering in which it sold 5,819,000 shares, or 40%, of its common stock to eligible depositors and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s Employee Stock Option Plan. The remaining majority of the 14,547,500 outstanding shares were owned by Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC, a federally chartered mutual holding company.
In July 2006, Atlantic Coast Federal, now a federally chartered stock savings association, was renamed Atlantic Coast Bank, to better reflect the nature of its operations.
In February 2011, the second step of the conversion from the mutual holding company structure was completed, along with a related public offering. As a result of the conversion, Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, the holding companies of Atlantic Coast Bank, were merged into Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation. Atlantic Coast Bank is 100% owned by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, and Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is 100% owned by public stockholders (NASDAQ: ACFC).
In February 2013, Bond Street Holdings and its bank subsidiary, Florida Community Bank, attempted to acquire Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank. The deal was voted down by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation's shareholders in June 2013.
In November 2013, the Board hired John K. Stephens, Jr., as President and CEO, to initiate a recapitalization and turnaround strategy. In December 2013, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation raised $48.3 million in a public stock offering (Nasdaq: "ACFC") by issuing 12,880,000 shares of its common stock. Net proceeds from the public offering were $44.9 million, the majority of which was contributed to Atlantic Coast Bank to improve capital ratios, to support growth in the Bank's loan and investment portfolios, and for general corporate purposes. The company simultaneously divested the majority of its nonperforming assets, resulting in a recapitalized, clean balance sheet.
During 2014, the company started a residential mortgage lending group and restaffed its commercial bank. Additionally, in June 2015, the company restructured and refinanced over $160 million in long-term debt to reduce expenses and mitigate risk. These actions have contributed to the company's return to profitability and stability.
In December 2016, the Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Atlantic Coast Bank has been recognized by the Jacksonville Business Journal as one of north Florida's "Best Places to Work" in both 2015 and 2016, and John Stephens was named one of the region's "Ultimate CEOs". The company was also selected as one of Florida's "Best Companies" by Florida Trend Magazine in July 2016.

Net proceeds from the public offering were $44.9 million, the majority of which was contributed to Atlantic Coast Bank to improve capital ratios, to support growth in the Bank's loan and investment portfolios, and for general corporate purposes. The company simultaneously divested the majority of its nonperforming assets, resulting in a recapitalized, clean balance sheet.
During 2014, the company started a residential mortgage lending group and restaffed its commercial bank. Additionally, in June 2015, the company restructured and refinanced over $160 million in long-term debt to reduce expenses and mitigate risk. These actions have contributed to the company's return to profitability and stability.
In December 2016, the Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Atlantic Coast Bank has been recognized by the Jacksonville Business Journal as one of north Florida's "Best Places to Work" in both 2015 and 2016, and John Stephens was named one of the region's "Ultimate CEOs". The company was also selected as one of Florida's "Best Companies" by Florida Trend Magazine in July 2016.

Offices and Branches[edit]
Atlantic Coast Bank maintains offices throughout Central and North Florida and Southeast Georgia. The company operates seven branches and one administrative office (which includes a stand-alone ATM) in Northeast Florida and three branches in Southeast Georgia. The Northeast Florida branches include Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach, the southside of Jacksonville, the westside of Jacksonville, Arlington, Julington Creek and Orange Park. The Southeast Georgia branches include two in Waycross and one in Douglas. In addition, Atlantic Coast Bank has mortgage and commercial loan production offices in Orlando, Florida, Gainesville, Florida, Tampa, Florida, Saint Petersburg, Florida, Saint Simons Island, Georgia and Savannah, Georgia, and has an SBA & USDA Lending office in Orlando, Florida, which funds small business loans throughout the Southeast U.S.
Banking and Financial Services[edit]
Atlantic Coast Bank is a full service community bank operating three distinct lines of business: Commercial Banking, Retail (Branch) Banking, and Residential Mortgage Lending. The Bank's specific services include, but are not limited to, deposit accounts, mortgage loans, auto loans, personal loans, credit cards, commercial loans, USDA loans, SBA loans, warehouse lending, and wealth management.[3]
History[edit]
The bank first opened its doors in 1939 as Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union in Waycross, Georgia, servicing the employees of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.
In November 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank known as Atlantic Coast Federal. The conversion allowed Atlantic Coast Federal to diversify its customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses within its market areas.
In January 2003, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation was organized for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock that Atlantic Coast Federal issued upon its mutual holding company reorganization from the mutual to stock form of ownership. In October 2004, Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation completed a minority stock offering in which it sold 5,819,000 shares, or 40%, of its common stock to eligible depositors and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation’s Employee Stock Option Plan. The remaining majority of the 14,547,500 outstanding shares were owned by Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC, a federally chartered mutual holding company.
In July 2006, Atlantic Coast Federal, now a federally chartered stock savings association, was renamed Atlantic Coast Bank, to better reflect the nature of its operations.
In February 2011, the second step of the conversion from the mutual holding company structure was completed, along with a related public offering. As a result of the conversion, Atlantic Coast Federal, MHC and Atlantic Coast Federal Corporation, the holding companies of Atlantic Coast Bank, were merged into Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation. Atlantic Coast Bank is 100% owned by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, and Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is 100% owned by public stockholders (NASDAQ: ACFC).
In February 2013, Bond Street Holdings and its bank subsidiary, Florida Community Bank, attempted to acquire Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and Atlantic Coast Bank. The deal was voted down by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation's shareholders in June 2013.
In November 2013, the Board hired John K. Stephens, Jr., as President and CEO, to initiate a recapitalization and turnaround strategy. In December 2013, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation raised $48.3 million in a public stock offering (Nasdaq: "ACFC") by issuing 12,880,000 shares of its common stock. Net proceeds from the public offering were $44.9 million, the majority of which was contributed to Atlantic Coast Bank to improve capital ratios, to support growth in the Bank's loan and investment portfolios, and for general corporate purposes. The company simultaneously divested the majority of its nonperforming assets, resulting in a recapitalized, clean balance sheet.
During 2014, the company started a residential mortgage lending group and restaffed its commercial bank. Additionally, in June 2015, the company restructured and refinanced over $160 million in long-term debt to reduce expenses and mitigate risk. These actions have contributed to the company's return to profitability and stability.
In December 2016, the Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Atlantic Coast Bank has been recognized by the Jacksonville Business Journal as one of north Florida's "Best Places to Work" in both 2015 and 2016, and John Stephens was named one of the region's "Ultimate CEOs". The company was also selected as one of Florida's "Best Companies" by Florida Trend Magazine in July 2016.

financial institution serving the Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia markets through 10 full-service branches and 5 lending offices.

Atlantic Coast Bank was established in 1939 as a credit union to serve the employees of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. On November 1, 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank (and subsequently a federally-chartered savings bank) known as Atlantic Coast Bank. The conversion allowed Atlantic Coast Bank to diversify its customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses in its market areas and make loans to customers who did not have a deposit relationship with Atlantic Coast Bank. On December 27, 2016, Atlantic Coast Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank.


Atlantic Coast Bank has traditionally focused on attracting deposits and investing those funds primarily in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, first mortgages on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences, and home equity loans. Additionally, Atlantic Coast Bank invests funds in multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. Atlantic Coast Bank also invests funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae
