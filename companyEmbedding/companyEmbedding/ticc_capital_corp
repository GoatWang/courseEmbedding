TICC Capital, Buckle, BlackBerry, Quantum and VOXX International highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - July 06, 2017 - Zacks Equity Research TICC Capital Corp  (NASDAQ:  TICC  - Free Report  ) as the Bull of the Day, Buckle  (NYSE:  BKE  - Free Report  ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BlackBerry Limited  (NASDAQ:  BBRY  - Free Report  ), Quantum Corporation  (NYSE:  QTM  - Free Report  ) and VOXX International  (NASDAQ:  VOXX  - Free Report  ). Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:   Bull of the Day    :   TICC Capital Corp  (NASDAQ:  TICC  - Free Report  ) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an "A" for value and momentum as well as a "C" for growth. Investors should put this stock on their radar screens right here after it has dropped about $1 per share over the last few weeks with the financials just starting to catch fire. A recent surge in price might also tell investors that it is bouncing off the bottom. TICC is a business development company that provides capital to companies that are looking to grow organically or via acquisition. They also provide capital for recapitalizations or even working capital for everyday business needs. The company primarily uses debt and its deal sizes are between $5M and $50M.  Earnings Estimates  Over the last sixty days, there were a few estimates that moved higher. Those revisions higher are the main reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 moved from $0.41 ninety days ago to $0.56 sixty days ago and is now at $0.62. That is quite a move in just 90 days, but it is exactly the type of thing you want to see in a stock you own.  Earnings History  The analysts seem to have this company figured out. Over the last four quarters, there was one beat, one miss and two meets of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. If I go back another four quarters I see the same pattern.   Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1    Valuation  I like what I see in terms of valuation. The stock trades at just 10x forward estimates and only 12x the twelve months trailing number. The price to book is 0.84x, meaning that we are getting true value here and by that, I don't mean the hardware company. Basically, we are buying in at less than the cost of all the assets the company has. That is a great thing to see. Finally, the price to sales of 4.6x is rather stiff, but it helps balance out the other metrics which are very strong.  Bear of the Day  :  Buckle  (NYSE:  BKE  - Free Report  ) is a retailer that has been hurt along with almost all other retailers this year. Weak comps and a recent downgrade to sell from hold have helped push the Zacks Consensus Estimate down and that is the reason this stock moved to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Description  Buckle, Inc. is a retailer of medium to better-priced casual apparel for young men and women. The company markets a wide selection of mostly brand name casual apparel, including denims, other casual bottoms, tops, sportswear, outerwear, accessories, and footwear. They emphasize personalized attention to their customers and provides individual customer services such as free alterations, free gift-wrapping, easy layaways and a frequent shopper program. Most stores are located in regional, high-traffic shopping malls, and this is their strategy for future expansion.  Downgrade  On May 19, Buckle was downgraded to Sell from Hold at Deutsche Bank. Moves like this generally come with negative earnings estimate revisions. At the time of publication, I did not see the full research report so I could not determine if there were any estimate revisions.  Earnings Estimates  The reason most stocks slide to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is that earnings estimates have fallen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BKE shows that the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate fell from $1.74 to $1.64 over the last 60 days. Similarly, the 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate dropped from $1.52 to $1.26. You can view the earnings estimate revision history on the Detailed Estimates  page on the Zacks website.  Additional content:    3 Tech Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now   Here at Zacks, we don't generally classify stocks as "cheap" or "expensive", and rather than looking at the stock's face value, we have a system that puts an emphasis on earnings estimate revisions to find stocks that will hopefully be winners for investors. That being said, low-priced stocks can be attractive to smaller investors that can't necessarily afford large stakes in companies with higher priced stocks. When looking at these low-priced stocks, we can look at the same trends in growth, value, and momentum and apply the Zacks Rank to properly analyze the potential that these companies have. Today we've highlighted three stocks that fall into the broad "technology sector." Each of these three stocks is currently trading for less than $10 per share and holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Take a look at the strong estimate revision activity and other factors that make these companies stick out right now.  1. BlackBerry Limited  (NASDAQ:  BBRY  - Free Report  ) Prior Close: $9.90 BlackBerry LTD is engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of hardware and software solutions for the mobile communications market. The company recently beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 100% in the latest quarter, and we've seen positive revisions to its current-quarter and full-year estimates as a result. BlackBerry will be able to post year-over-year EPS growth, in spite of its declining revenue, because the company has successfully shifted its focus away from its failing handset division and towards the more-profitable software business. In fact, BlackBerry has emerged as a player in the cybersecurity space, even prevailing as a factor after the recent WannaCry malware attacks.  2. Quantum Corporation  (NYSE:  QTM  - Free Report  ) Prior Close: $8.01 Quantum is a leading provider of data storage and protection. The company provides solutions for capturing, sharing, and preserving digital assets over the entire data lifecycle. The current fiscal year is shaping up to be one of aggressive earnings growth for Quantum; our current Zacks Consensus Estiamte calls for the company to post EPS growth of 96% this year. It's also worth noting that the stock has been on an incredible run, gaining nearly 160% over the past year. Nevertheless, its previous closing price is about 13% lower than its 52-week high, which means there's plenty of upside before we even have to think about breaking into a new range.  3. VOXX International  (NASDAQ:  VOXX  - Free Report  ) Prior Close: $8.50 Voxx International is a designer of automobile sound, vehicle security, mobile video systems, and consumer electronics products. On top of its strong Zacks Rank, VOXX has recorded strong Style Scores grades of "B" in the Value and VGM categories. Furthermore, we have seen one positive estimate revision in the last 60 days for the company's full-year earnings, a period where we expect to see EPS growth of nearly 17%. Voxx also belongs to a category of businesses that currently sit in the top 21% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Finally, Voxx has maintained strong momentum over the past 52 weeks, and the stock is looking to break into a new range after gaining more than 200% in the past year.

Bottom Line  A stock's market price is not a clear indicator of whether it is a good investment. However, the nice thing about the Zacks Rank is that it can be applied to stocks of any price. For smaller investors looking to find solid tech stocks at lower prices, this list is a great place to start.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2%, respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Bull Of The Day: TICC Capital Corp


July 06, 2017, 06:25:00 AM EDT
By Brian Bolan, Zacks.com

TICC Capital Corp (TICC) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an "A" for value and momentum as well as a "C" for growth. Investors should put this stock on their radar screens right here after it has dropped about $1 per share over the last few weeks with the financials just starting to catch fire.  A recent surge in price might also tell investors that it is bouncing off the bottom.TICC is a business development company that provides capital to companies that are looking to grow organically or via acquisition. They also provide capital for recapitalizations or even working capital for everyday business needs.  The company primarily uses debt and its deal sizes are between $5M and $50M.Earnings EstimatesOver the last sixty days , there were a few estimates that moved higher.  Those revisions higher are the main reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 moved from $0.41 ninety days ago to $0.56 sixty days ago and is now at $0.62.  That is quite a move in just 90 days, but it is exactly the type of thing you want to see in a stock you own.Earnings HistoryThe analysts seem to have this company figured out.  Over the last four quarters , there was one beat, one miss and two meets of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  If I go back another four quarters I see the same pattern.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1ValuationI like what I see in terms of valuation.  The stock trades at just 10x forward estimates and only 12x the twelve months trailing number.  The price to book is 0.84x, meaning that we are getting true value here and by that , I don't mean the hardware company.  Basically, we are buying in at less than the cost of all the assets the company has.  That is a great thing to see.  Finally, the price to sales of 4.6x is rather stiff, but it helps balance out the other metrics which are very strong.TICC Capital Corp. Price and ConsensusTICC Capital Corp. Price and Consensus | TICC Capital Corp. QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

TICC CAPITAL CORP. (NASDAQ:TICC) Files An 8-K Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security HoldersItem 5.07.
Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
On July 6, 2017, TICC Capital Corp. (the “Company”) held its Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Meeting”). Set forth below are the proposals voted upon at the Meeting, as set forth in the Companys Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 12, 2017, and the final voting tabulation reported by the Companys inspector of elections.
The Companys Board of Directors fixed the close of business on June 5, 2017 as the record date for identifying those stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. A total of 51,479,409 shares of the Companys common stock were entitled to vote at the Meeting. A quorum of the stockholders was present at the Meeting. The final voting results for each of the proposals were as follows:
Proposal 1.Stockholders elected two nominees for directors, who will each serve for a three-year term to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders based on the following votes:

Proposal 2.Stockholders ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 based on the following votes:

Proposal 3.Stockholders did not approve a proposal to authorize the Company to sell shares of its common stock at a price or prices below the Companys then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings, in each case subject to the approval of its board of directors and compliance with the conditions set forth in the proxy statement pertaining thereto (including, without limitation, that the number of shares issued does not exceed 25% of the Companys then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering) based on the following votes:

* For purposes of this proposal, the affirmative vote of (1) a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Meeting; and (2) a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Meeting that are not held by affiliated persons of the Company was required to approve this proposal. For purposes of this proposal, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, defines “a majority of the outstanding shares” as: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at the Meeting if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy; or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, whichever is the less. Based on these final voting results, Proposal 3 failed to receive the required vote of the stockholders and was not adopted by the stockholders of the Company.
The Company had also solicited votes for the adjournment of the Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies (“Proposal 4”). However, since it was not necessary to adjourn the Meeting to solicit additional votes on the first three proposals, a vote was not taken on Proposal 4.

Financing organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and working capital. 

                                            TICC Capital Corp. (NasdaqGS: TICC) is a business development company primarily engaged in providing debt capital to a wide-range of U.S.-based companies. 
                                                        Our investment activities are managed by TICC Mangement, LLC, an investment advisr that is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                                        
We generally expect to invest between $5.0 million and $50.0 million in each of our portfolio companies, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the                                         size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant, and accrue interest at fixed or variable rates.




                                                “We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if                                                    any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio.”
                                                        











TICC Capital Corp. is a closed-end, non-diversified 
				                    management investment company that has elected to be regulated 
				                    as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment 
				                    Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Our investment 
				                    objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return. Our 
				                    primary focus is to seek current income by investing primarily 
				                    in corporate debt securities. 
Our capital is generally used by our portfolio companies to 
				                    finance organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and 
				                    working capital. Our investment decisions are based on extensive 
				                    analysis of potential portfolio companies’ business operations 
				                    supported by an in-depth understanding of the quality of their 
				                    recurring revenues and cash flow, variability of costs and the 
				                    inherent value of their assets, including proprietary intangible 
				                    assets and intellectual property. In making our CLO investments, 
				                    we consider the indenture structure for that vehicle, its 
				                    operating characteristics and compliance with its various 
				                    indenture provisions, as well as its corporate loan-based 
				                    collateral pool.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
TICC Capital Corp. ("TICC," "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a closed-end,
non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated
as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Our investment objective is to maximize our
portfolio's total return. Our primary focus is to seek current income by
investing primarily in corporate debt securities. Our debt investments may
include syndicated loans (those where multiple investors hold portions of that
loan) and bilateral loans (loans where we hold the entirety of a particular
loan). We have and may continue to invest in structured finance investments,
including collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") investment vehicles that own
debt securities. CLO investments may also include warehouse facilities, which
are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form
the basis of a CLO vehicle.  ... More ...

Style Scores:



A Value | C Growth | A Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
