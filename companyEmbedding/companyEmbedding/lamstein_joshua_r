Mr. Lamstein has also been a General Partner of Isoseles Madefire Investors, LLC since July 2013 and BriefCam Investments L.P. since December 2012, each a special purpose vehicle created to invest in an early-stage technology company. Since June 2013, Mr.  Lamstein has been a director of Penske Media Group, a global media company, as a designee of Quadrangle Group, a private equity firm. In August 2010, Mr. Lamstein co-founded Soli, a global mobile marketing company, and served as its Chief Operating Officer until its acquisition in November 2012 by Acision Nederland B.V., a leading SMS provider to the world's largest telecommunication companies. Mr.  Lamstein was a founding member of GF Capital Private Equity Fund in 2004 and served as a Director from 2004 to 2008 and a Managing Director from 2008 to September 2010. In 2004, Mr. Lamstein was also a Portfolio Consultant to a family investment office. From 2000 to 2003, Mr. Lamstein was a Partner of LMS Capital, a FTSE-listed investment trust focused on private equity and venture capital investments and established the trust's U.S. operations. Since 1999, Mr. Lamstein has been a Senior Advisor to John Snow Incorporated, a leading public healthcare consulting firm, having also served as its interim CFO from 1999 to 2000. Mr. Lamstein previously worked in London for Apollo Advisors, a global private equity firm. Mr.  Lamstein started his financial services career as an investment banker for Lehman Brothers in London and New York. Mr. Lamstein received his B.A., with honors, from Colgate University and his M.B.A. from the MIT Sloan School of Management. We believe Mr. Lamstein is well-qualified to be on our Board of Directors due to his broad experience in private equity, venture capital, and investing in and managing early ventures, his widespread relationships in the private equity and venture capital communities and his knowledge of public healthcare.
