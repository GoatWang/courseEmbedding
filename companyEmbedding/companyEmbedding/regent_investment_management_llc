Regent Investment Management and its founding firm and principals have supported the capital growth of high net-worth individuals, corporate retirement plans, and foundations since 1990.  Our Team is experienced, we provide highly personalized service, and we are local  – our clients know and interact with the manager who is investing their money.    	        
As of June 30, 2017, we manage over $380 million in assets in three strategies:


All Cap Core Strategy - We believe it is critical to identify the long-term investment themes governing the equity markets. We manage each of our client accounts individually, and within the construct of your objectives, we invest your portfolio to benefit from these themes.
                  


Tax–Managed strategy - Similar to our All Cap Core strategy but with some tactical differences, our Tax-Managed strategy focuses on our long-term investment themes, buying great companies at attractive prices, and selling prudently based on valuation, fundamentals, and tax management. We also sell-short stocks that we view unfavorably and use options to enhance our returns.
                  


Momentum strategy - Our  Momentum strategy employs a quantitative, price momentum based model for sectors and indexes developed by Marty McClelland. The objective is to achieve attractive rates of return while controlling risk. This model was originally developed based on seven years of market data from 1990 through 1996, and it has been continuously refined and managed since 1997.

Momentum Strategy

						Our  Momentum strategy employs a quantitative, price momentum based rotation model for sectors and indexes developed by Marty McClelland. The objective is to achieve attractive rates of return while controlling risk. This model was originally developed based on seven years of market data from 1990 through 1996, and it has been continuously refined and managed since 1997.

Investment Philosophy

                        During any period of time, there are groups of similar securities ("sectors") that outperform the market averages. These periods of outperformance can last for as long as one year or more. Often, even in flat or down markets, selected sectors perform well. For example, if high oil prices threaten economic growth, at least one of the energy related sectors should perform well. If commodity inflation pressures the market, the precious metal sector should outperform. The investment strategy is designed to capitalize on this behavior. The years 2005 and 2007 provide examples. The market was up approximately 5% in both 2005 and 2007, and the strategy significantly outperformed in each year - based on a heavy focus on energy-related sectors and gold.
                
When Do We Buy?

                        We monitor over 75 index, sector and exchange traded funds daily and identify those funds exhibiting the most momentum over short, intermediate and long-term periods. We invest in the top-performing funds, and hold each as long as it remains in the set of top performers.
                    
When Do We Sell?

                        Our sell decision is based entirely on long-term momentum to avoid unnecessary volatility caused by temporary, short-term moves. When a fund falls out of the set of top performing funds, we sell it and replace it with a fund from the set of then top performers.  In cases where no funds are demonstrating positive momentum, the strategy invests in a money market fund to protect against excessive losses. When we are fully invested, we employ "stop loss" triggers for risk control.
                    
What To Expect

                        The  Momentum strategy typically outperforms in sustained upward-trending markets characterized by consistent market leadership. Where the strategy typically underperforms is during market transitions such as early 2003 (bearish to bullish) and 2009 (bearish to bullish). The strategy would likely underperform the market in an environment where no sectors demonstrate a sustained upward move and individual sectors repeatedly rally only to quickly decline to price levels below where the rally began.

All CAP CORE STRATEGY
A highly personalized approach to client services

						We manage each of our client accounts individually. Throughout our relationship, we maintain an understanding of your objectives, your risk tolerance, your tax profile, and any special situations, and we manage your portfolio accordingly.
					

                        Your funds are held by your brokerage firm, and we provide specific trading instructions to your broker. You receive trade confirmations and account statements directly from your broker. If you don't have a broker, we will work with you to identify a broker who suits your needs. 
                    

                        We meet with you on a regular basis to review your portfolio. And we're always available to consult with you on any financial matter.
                    
A Global View   •   Outstanding Companies   •   Attention to Value

                   We believe it is critical to identify the long-term investment themes governing the equity markets. These themes could be based on demographic factors (aging baby boomers, for example), global dynamics (the growth of the emerging market middle class), or market dynamics (sustained low interest rates impacting the asset class of investor choice).  Next, we identify the regions of the world, sectors and companies that are the greatest beneficiaries of these themes. Based on this view, we are likely to be overweight these regions, sectors, and companies. 
                    
When Do We Buy?


                        When buying stocks, we love growth, but we insist on value.  Growth at a reasonable price is a strategy that has been shown to outperform the market over time.  In these uncertain times, dividends and growth of dividends provides both necessary cash flow and downside protection.  We are patient buyers - markets are volatile, and we use this to your advantage to enter positions at attractive prices.  We own these companies as long as they continue to be great companies.
                    

When Do We Sell?

                        We will generally sell when one of three scenarios occurs.  If a stock price exceeds our estimate of full value, we will sell part or all of the position. If a stock becomes too concentrated (generally 5-10% of the portfolio), we will sell some of the position. If the company's fundamentals deteriorate and we believe the stock price no longer supports the company fundamentals, we will sell the position.
                    
Tax Efficiency

                        For taxable clients, we manage accounts with an eye on after-tax returns.  We always consider capital gains before selling stocks. We limit short-term gains for taxable clients and whenever prudent will harvest losses to offset gains.

Tax – Managed Strategy

						Similar to our All Cap Core strategy, our Tax-Managed strategy focuses on our long-term investment themes, buying great companies at attractive prices, and selling prudently based on valuation, fundamentals, and tax management.
					
 
						Our investment strategy differs from the All Cap Core strategy in three areas:



Average holding period - although many of our large positions tend to be long-term holdings, we trade more actively in the  Tax-Managed strategy, attempting to capitalize on short- and medium-term market fluctuations to buy low and sell high.
                  

Short Selling - we will short sell stocks in sectors not expected to benefit from our long-term investment themes, or where we believe the stock's valuation is unattractive relative to the market, or where the company is experiencing deteriorating fundamentals and the stock price does not reflect such. 
                        

Options - when market volatility is favorable for options premiums, we sell call and put options to earn premiums and to sell and buy positions at opportunistic prices.
                        

Tax Management

                        Our  Tax-Managed strategy focuses on generating attractive after-tax returns. To achieve this, we harvest short-term losses to offset gains. In addition, we are reluctant to sell stocks with short-term gains due to disadvantageous taxation at high ordinary income rates. Most of the gains historically generated in our  Tax-Managed strategy have been long-term, providing attractive after-tax returns to our clients.

 Important Disclosure Information 





Market Letter
          2nd Quarter 2017

						The market’s strength continued during the second quarter.  Interest rates remain at low levels and fell further during the quarter.  This brings us back to TINA (There Is No Alternative), and TINA drives money into the stock market.  The economy slowed a bit during the first quarter to about a 1.5% annual growth rate, but it accelerated in the second quarter to about 2.5%.  Commodity prices were weak during Q2 which caused the stock market to worry less about interest rate increases.                     
				  


 
Q2, 2017
2017 YTD


S&P500 
3.1%
  9.3%


Dow Jones
4.0%
  9.4%


NASDAQ
4.2%
14.7%


Foreign markets generally outperformed the U.S. during the second quarter.  Europe was the best performer (VGK gained 8.4% during Q2) and Brazil was the worst (EWZ fell 8.1%)


Q2, 2017 Review
Technology stocks were strong during the second quarter, with the NASDAQ once again outperforming the S&P500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  People talk about FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google), and these and similar stocks have paced the market all year.  For the year, Facebook is up 31%; Apple is up 25%; Amazon is up 29%; Netflix is up 21%; and Google is up 17%.             
                        
                        Healthcare stocks were very strong during the second quarter.  Some of the fears about a healthcare bill faded.  The bill is not tough on drug pricing; it removes taxes on medical devices; and it is friendly to health insurance companies.  For the second quarter, Amgen increased 6%; Medtronic gained 10%; and United Healthcare increased 14%.  These are big leaders in their sub-sectors, but they are mostly representative of healthcare sector performance.  
                        
                        Energy stocks were the worst performers in the market with the XLE index falling 6.5%.  Iran, Iraq and Libya are all producing more oil, and U.S. production is booming.       
                        						                        
                        In our letter from the last quarter, we wrote about our inflation concerns, and we highlighted commodity prices.  Commodity prices had been strong, but they were broadly weaker in Q2.  Oil is the biggest component of commodity prices, and it fell again during Q2 - from $50.60 to $46.04.  Natural gas prices also fell during Q2.  Copper, Gold and Soy Bean prices were relatively unchanged; Corn and Wheat were up during Q2.
                        
                        Wages are still up almost 3% over the same time last year, but the fall in commodities caused the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to slow down.  The most recent CPI was up 1.9%, which is still below the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate of 2.0%.  The unemployment rate ticked down 0.1% during the quarter to 4.3%.  The Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 0.25% in June, but given the reduction in inflation, the Federal Reserve may hold off in raising interest rates for the rest of this year. 
                        
                        Despite the rise in short–term interest rates, longer term rates declined, with the yield on the 10–year Treasury bond falling from 2.42% to 2.27%.  Financial stocks (XLF) were weak early in the quarter, but rallied strongly at the end of the quarter for a total increase of 4.4%.  
                        
                        The U.S. Dollar was weak during the second quarter.  Combined with better Q2 growth, this caused estimates for corporate profits (earnings) to increase.  The Price–to–Earnings ratio (P/E) for the market remains high at about 18.  This is higher than the long–term average.  If rates stay low and growth stays positive, TINA should remain in place and an 18 P/E is sustainable.  However, the higher the P/E gets, the higher the risk becomes if rates increase or if growth falters.  
                        
                        
                        
Q3, 2017 Investment Strategy
The 2016 election changed our view slightly.  Had Mrs. Clinton been elected, we expected a recession in 2017 or 2018.  The Trump administration is reducing regulations and generally helping businesses.  There are promises of foreign profits repatriation, lower tax rates and increased infrastructure spending.  The market is still giving the administration the benefit of doubt on these issues.  If enacted, these policies won’t stop the business cycle, but they are likely to extend it, and we are now planning for a later downturn in 2019 or 2020.  We became modestly more bullish after the election.  In Q2, we maintained this modestly bullish posture, and we plan the same for Q3.      
						
						We must remember that we are now over 8 years into this economic expansion that began in March, 2009.  The longest expansion in the history of the U.S. has been 10 years.  Although we became more bullish after the election, we remain aware that a downturn is still likely to be on the near–term horizon.  If the market continues to perform well and P/E ratios expand further, or if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, we will move to a more defensive posture.    

						The Federal Reserve is now forecasting one additional rate increase in 2017 – taking the Federal Funds rate from the current 1.25% to 1.50%.  Since inflation has moderated recently, we think they may hold off on this rate increase.  The 2018 forecast is for 3 rate increases – for a total increase of 0.75%.  Growth will need to pick up for this to happen.   In addition to raising short-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve also plans to shrink its balance sheet (i.e. own less bonds and mortgages).  In the last few years, the Fed has been increasing its balance sheet (Quantitative Easing) to keep interest rates artificially low.  Starting later this year, they plan to stop buying bonds and mortgages and to potentially begin selling them.  The Fed moving from a buyer to a seller should have the effect of increasing interest rates.

                        With growth continuing and with the Fed removing accommodation, we expect interest rates to rise later this year and next year.  The interest rate on the 10–year Treasury bond is currently about 2.3%.  We expect that it will rise to 2.5% – 3.0% this year and perhaps as high as 3.5% – 4.0% in 2018/2019.  If this happens, we doubt the economy can handle rates this high, and this could be the trigger for a 2019 or 2020 recession.  
                        
                        It’s also possible that the next downturn could be triggered by a geopolitical event.  North Korea is probably the most concerning.  Between Kim Jong–un and Donald Trump you would be hard pressed to find more potentially volatile adversaries.  A confrontation with North Korea would definitely affect South Korea, Japan and China.  These are more than big enough to matter and could cause real damage to our economy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
