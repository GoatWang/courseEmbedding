    president, effective immediately. John R. Ingram will continue to be active as chairman of the company. 
“Shawn is a proven leader, well-known across our industry, and he is certainly the right CEO as we write the next chapter in our company’s story,” John
    Ingram said. “Ingram has experienced tremendous growth and transformation, particularly over the past few years. Shawn’s leadership, technology and
    engineering backgrounds, and passion for our business and our clients have helped make this evolution possible.”
Ingram noted that he will continue his own leadership role in the business, particularly in the areas of strategy, new business opportunities and developing
    new connections, and participating in strategic relationships across the dynamic publishing industry. 
Morin began his career at Ingram in 2009 when he joined the company as chief information officer and, in December 2009, he was named president of VitalSource,
    Ingram’s learning technology division. In 2012, he was named chief operating officer and was named president and chief operating officer in January
    2015. 
He has been responsible for expanding and introducing new services and technologies to Ingram’s clients of publishers, libraries, booksellers and educators
    worldwide. He has led major initiatives that have transformed the company, including strategic acquisitions of CourseSmart and Perseus’ distribution
    businesses; divestiture of Coutts Information Services; expansion of Ingram’s capabilities and network by implementing automated print-on-demand in
    Fairfield, Ohio and opening a new facility in Fresno, Calif.; new collaborations between Ingram and allied businesses across the industry; the opening
    of a new facility in Antioch, Tenn.; and the launch of IngramSpark, an innovative publishing program for independent publishers.
“I am inspired each day by the people at Ingram and the clients and customers we serve,” Morin said today. “Serving as our CEO is a great honor. I’m looking
    forward to continuing to transform and grow our company, so it remains relevant in our evolving industry.”
Morin came to Ingram from Bass Pro Shops, based in Springfield, Mo., where he was chief information officer and vice president of information technology.
    Earlier in his career, he was the lead engineer working on the on-board flight software for the Space Shuttle program at the Kennedy Space Center in
    Florida.
Morin received his bachelor’s degree in Engineering (Computer Technology) from the University of South Florida.About Ingram

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Hines John R II Attorney1001 N Highway 77Waxahachie, TX 75165(972) 937-2720AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Mardock John R Dds(3)717 Straus RdCedar Hill, TX 75104(972) 291-5422DentistsOral & Maxillofacial Surgery I absolutely love Dr Mardock I had a tooth extraction today I was so extremely nervous and terrified and after it was all over with it had to of been the most simplest procedure ever Dr Mardock is amazing he made me feel very comfortable and I was not in any pain whatsoever I recommend him to a…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. John R Valant DDS102 S 7th StMidlothian, TX 76065(972) 723-9116DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Torrisi, John R, MD4500 S Lancaster RdDallas, TX 75216(214) 857-0141Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection5. Rittenberry John R423 Morning Dove DrDuncanville, TX 75137(972) 298-3375No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Salazar John R851 S R L Thornton Fwy Ste 106Dallas, TX 75203(214) 943-2886AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. John R Salazar P C2201 Main StDallas, TX 75201(214) 943-2886AttorneysParalegalsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Roach, John R901 Main StDallas, TX 75202(214) 672-2000AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Riddle, John R - Strasburger & Price Llp901 Main St Ste 4300Dallas, TX 75202(214) 651-4672Litigation & Tort AttorneysAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Cohn John R Atty1700 Pacific AveDallas, TX 75201(214) 969-1420Tax AttorneysAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Griffin, John R3900 Junius StDallas, TX 75246(972) 386-7546Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection12. Rowlett John R2001 Ross AveDallas, TX 75201(214) 758-1510AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection13. Cohn, John R, JD1722 Routh St Ste 1500Dallas, TX 75201(214) 969-1420AttorneysCriminal Law AttorneysServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your shopping collection!Error when adding to shopping collectionThis business was removed from the shopping collection14. Mara John R Law Books4524 Sycamore StDallas, TX 75204(214) 821-1979Book StoresAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection15. McCarthy John R Jr2001 Ross AveDallas, TX 75201(214) 880-8102No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection16. Law Office of John R.

"Shawn is a proven leader, well-known across our industry, and he is certainly the right CEO as we write the next chapter in our company's story," John Ingram said. "Ingram has experienced tremendous growth and transformation, particularly over the past few years. Shawn's leadership, technology and engineering backgrounds, and passion for our business and our clients have helped make this evolution possible."
Ingram noted that he will continue his own leadership role in the business, particularly in the areas of strategy, new business opportunities and developing new connections, and participating in strategic relationships across the dynamic publishing industry.
Morin began his career at Ingram in 2009 when he joined the company as chief information officer and, in December 2009, he was named president of VitalSource, Ingram's learning technology division. In 2012, he was named chief operating officer and was named president and chief operating officer in January 2015.
He has been responsible for expanding and introducing new services and technologies to Ingram's clients of publishers, libraries, booksellers and educators worldwide. He has led major initiatives that have transformed the company, including strategic acquisitions of CourseSmart and Perseus' distribution businesses; divestiture of Coutts Information Services; expansion of Ingram's capabilities and network by implementing automated print-on-demand in Fairfield, Ohio and opening a new facility in Fresno, Calif.; new collaborations between Ingram and allied businesses across the industry; the opening of a new facility in Antioch, Tenn.; and the launch of IngramSpark, an innovative publishing program for independent publishers.
"I am inspired each day by the people at Ingram and the clients and customers we serve," Morin said today. "Serving as our CEO is a great honor. I'm looking forward to continuing to transform and grow our company, so it remains relevant in our evolving industry."
Morin came to Ingram from Bass Pro Shops, based in Springfield, Mo., where he was chief information officer and vice president of information technology. Earlier in his career, he was the lead engineer working on the on-board flight software for the Space Shuttle program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Morin received his bachelor's degree in Engineering (Computer Technology) from the University of South Florida.
