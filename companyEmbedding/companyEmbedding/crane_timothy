 Other Life I Dream CD music Product Description

Other Life I Dream album for sale by Timothy Crane was released Oct 11, 2004 on the Eagles Nest label. Personnel: Timothy Crane. Other Life I Dream CD music contains a single disc with 10 songs. Timothy Crane is a composer and recording artist living near beautiful Denver, Colorado. Other Life I Dream songs From the time he started at the age of five, playing the piano has been the most enduring part of Tim's life. Other Life I Dream album for sale In a way, he was born into it. Other Life I Dream CD music Tim learned to play on a piano that was handed down from his great aunt, who accompanied the silent pictures during matinees at the Jayhawk Theater in Topeka, Kansas. Other Life I Dream buy CD music The stories about that piano, a 100 year-old Knabe, and about his ancestors who played it, kept Tim interested enough to practice when his friends and the weather tempted him to do otherwise. Throughout high-school and college Tim played in a variety of local bands and also as a solo piano player. After college he continued to play for public functions, private parties, and charitable events as a solo act and in a number of often oddly-named musical groups. While living near Aspen, Colorado, he studied music theory and composition while playing each week for his local church. "That was a wonderful time in my life," he says. "Still," he jokes, "an awful lot of the songs that I played for offerings were pop songs that needed to be sanctified." In the past two years, Tim has embarked on a new path in his music career -- recording his original music. This summer, Tim released his first album, The Other Life I Dream, a collection of piano instrumental pieces with an orchestra background. He continues to compose, and has recently completed writing the pieces that will form the core of his second album, Dragonfly.

Soil and/or moisture resistant secure document



Patent number:  8366879
                                            

Abstract:  A soil and/or moisture resistant secure document and a method for producing such a secure document, are provided. The inventive method preferably employs a size press or other similar device to force a soil and/or moisture resistant formulation into the pores of the substrate and to remove excess formulation from opposing surfaces thereof. Soil and/or moisture resistant formulations when applied this way instead of by way of standard coating techniques do not obscure optically variable effects generated by non-porous OVDs that may be employed on or within these secure documents. In addition, thin layers of fibers (e.g., papermaking fibers) overlying and thus embedding portions of security devices in windowed secure documents that have been rendered soil and/or moisture resistant in accordance with this invention demonstrate increased durability.

Micro-optic film structure that alone or together with a security document or label projects images spatially coordinated with static images and/or other projected images



Patent number:  8284492
                                            

Abstract:  A micro-optic film structure that alone or together with a security document or label projects images spatially coordinated with static images and/or other projected images is provided. The inventive film structure is made up of: (a) one or more polymer film materials; (b) one or more planar arrangements of primary image icons; (c) one or more planar arrangements of focusing elements or lenses; and (d) one or more secondary image icons. The planar arrangements are configured such that when a planar arrangement of primary image icons is viewed through a planar arrangement of focusing elements or lenses, one or more first synthetic images are projected. The secondary image icons appear as static and/or other projected images. These images are spatially coordinated with the first synthetic image(s) projected by the film structure, such that when simultaneously displayed therewith, they visually enhance or cancel the projected first synthetic image(s).

Currency verification device



Patent number:  5434427
                                            

Abstract:  A photodiode and a phototransistor are positioned on opposite sides of a document subjected to verification for authenticity under transmitted light. A logic circuit determines the presence or absence of the security feature and correspondingly provides visual or audible indication thereof. The photodiode, phototransistor and related circuitry are arranged within an enclosure that is attached to a currency receiving device such as a cash register. The visual or audible indicators are mounted on the cash register for immediate indication of the currency verification to the cashier. A simplified capacitive proximity sensor can be employed, per se, for inexpensive applications or for redundant verification in combination with an optical detector. The shape of the capacitive sensor is configured to that of the security thread to discriminate between the security thread and the currency paper. Additional optical circuits are employed to detect counterfeit markings on the currency surface.

Microwave security thread detector



Patent number:  5279403
                                            

Abstract:  A security thread detector for verifying the authenticity of banknotes. In the preferred embodiment, the invention comprises a housing with a passage through which banknotes can be passed, wherein the housing also comprises a waveguide, a microwave oscillator for generating microwaves and two resonating slots on a wall of the waveguide, and a microwave detector. After a banknote is inserted through the passageway, the microwave diode produces an analog signal that is proportional to the microwave strength. The diode and the slots are arranged such that the radiated power from each slot is one hundred eighty degrees out-of-phase. If a banknote has no security thread, then the detector receives a balanced signal. If the banknote contains a security thread, the thread interferes with one of the radiating slots. This interference causes an imbalance condition and a corresponding signal is sent from the detector diode. The resulting signal is then sent to a microprocessor which activates an appropriate indicator.

Currency verification device including ferrous oxide detection



Patent number:  5151607
                                            

Abstract:  An automatic verification device for currency and other security paper containing an embedded security thread first determines the presence of the thread within the paper and then assures that the thread is not present on the paper surface. The device is in the form of a stand-alone currency insertion unit similar to a credit card reader and includes a metal detection circuit to verify the presence of the embedded metal thread. Photo detectors within the unit detect the presence of reflected light off either or both currency surfaces. The currency is verified when the metal is detected and there is no reflection off either surface of the currency paper.

History[edit]
Stephen Crane was the first in the Crane family to become a papermaker, buying his first mill, “The Liberty Paper Mill”, in 1770.[1] He sold currency-type paper to engraver Paul Revere, who printed the American Colonies’ first paper money. In 1801, Crane was founded by Zenas Crane, Henry Wiswall and John Willard. The company’s original mill had a daily output of 20 posts (1 post = 125 sheets). Shortly after, in 1806, Crane began printing currency on cotton paper for local, as well as regional, banks, before officially printing for the government. Crane developed a method to embed parallel silk threads in banknote paper to denominate notes and deter counterfeiting in 1844.
In 1879, Crane grew when Winthrop M. Crane won a contract to deliver U.S. currency paper to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C. Crane produced both the yellow (issued in 1883–1884) and the white (1884–1894) watermarked security papers for the nation’s Postal Notes. These early money orders were produced for sale throughout the postal system by the Homer Lee Bank Note Company (1883–1887), the American Bank Note Company (1887–1891), and Dunlap & Clarke (1891–1894). In 1922, Crane & Co. incorporated, with Frederick G. Crane elected as president.
In 2002, Crane purchased the company Tumba Bruk from the Central Bank of Sweden (Riksbank) and operates this today as Crane AB.
In 2015, Crane announced that it would be turning over its stationery division to employees via a "management buyout" by the end of December.[2]
Motion[edit]
Crane’s Motion[3] security technology is being introduced into high denomination banknotes worldwide. The design involves a micro-lens array interacting with graphics far smaller than any microprinting.
Sweden’s 1000 kronor banknote, released in 2006, was the first banknote to use Crane’s Motion technology. A 2007 AP article[4] reveals that the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing will use a new security thread containing “650,000 tiny lenses” (now believed to be over 1 million lenses per inch of thread)[3] in the $100 bill design released on October 8, 2013.[5]
In September 2008, Crane initiated purchase negotiations with Visual Physics, a subsidiary of Nanoventions, based in Atlanta, Georgia. This purchase gave Crane exclusive control of Motion.
News[edit]
According to the Times Of Malta, the Boston-based currency printer will open a "state-of-the-art" $100 million facility in Malta, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced Wednesday, September 21.[6]

History[edit]
Stephen Crane was the first in the Crane family to become a papermaker, buying his first mill, “The Liberty Paper Mill”, in 1770.[1] He sold currency-type paper to engraver Paul Revere, who printed the American Colonies’ first paper money. In 1801, Crane was founded by Zenas Crane, Henry Wiswall and John Willard. The company’s original mill had a daily output of 20 posts (1 post = 125 sheets). Shortly after, in 1806, Crane began printing currency on cotton paper for local, as well as regional, banks, before officially printing for the government. Crane developed a method to embed parallel silk threads in banknote paper to denominate notes and deter counterfeiting in 1844.
In 1879, Crane grew when Winthrop M. Crane won a contract to deliver U.S. currency paper to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C. Crane produced both the yellow (issued in 1883–1884) and the white (1884–1894) watermarked security papers for the nation’s Postal Notes. These early money orders were produced for sale throughout the postal system by the Homer Lee Bank Note Company (1883–1887), the American Bank Note Company (1887–1891), and Dunlap & Clarke (1891–1894). In 1922, Crane & Co. incorporated, with Frederick G. Crane elected as president.
In 2002, Crane purchased the company Tumba Bruk from the Central Bank of Sweden (Riksbank) and operates this today as Crane AB.
In 2015, Crane announced that it would be turning over its stationery division to employees via a "management buyout" by the end of December.[2]
Motion[edit]
Crane’s Motion[3] security technology is being introduced into high denomination banknotes worldwide. The design involves a micro-lens array interacting with graphics far smaller than any microprinting.
Sweden’s 1000 kronor banknote, released in 2006, was the first banknote to use Crane’s Motion technology. A 2007 AP article[4] reveals that the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing will use a new security thread containing “650,000 tiny lenses” (now believed to be over 1 million lenses per inch of thread)[3] in the $100 bill design released on October 8, 2013.[5]
In September 2008, Crane initiated purchase negotiations with Visual Physics, a subsidiary of Nanoventions, based in Atlanta, Georgia. This purchase gave Crane exclusive control of Motion.
News[edit]
According to the Times Of Malta, the Boston-based currency printer will open a "state-of-the-art" $100 million facility in Malta, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced Wednesday, September 21.[6]
