The information set forth in or incorporated
by reference in Items 4, 5 and 6 of this Schedule 13D is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 3.
On May 22, 2017 (the “Closing
Date”), TPG Growth Sidewall acquired 140,202 Series A Preferred Shares and 9,798 Series B Preferred Shares pursuant to
the Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”), dated as of March 22, 2017, by and among the Issuer and
TPG Growth Sidewall. The purchase of the Preferred Shares under the Investment Agreement had been subject to certain conditions,
including the completion of the Issuer’s tender offer for all (but not less than 75% of) the outstanding shares of Uniwheels
AG (the “Issuer’s Target”). The aggregate purchase price of the Preferred Shares was $150,000,000 and
was funded by equity contributions of the limited partners of TPG Growth Sidewall.
The Issuer and TPG Growth Sidewall made
certain customary representations, warranties and covenants to each other in the Investment Agreement.
References to and the description of
the Investment Agreement set forth above are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
full text of the Investment Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.
The information set forth in Items 3,
5 and 6 of this Schedule 13D is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 4.
Series A Preferred
Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations,
Preferences and Rights of the Preferred Shares (the “Certificate of Designations”), each Series A Preferred
Share is convertible at any time after the Closing Date into a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the
sum of the Stated Value (as defined below) and any accrued and unpaid dividends by (ii) $28.162 (the “Conversion
Price”). The Stated Value (the “Stated Value”) of each Series A Preferred Share is equal to $1,000
plus (i) any dividends paid in the form of an increase in the Stated Value and (ii) all accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. The Preferred Shares may not be
convertible into more than 19.99% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the “Conversion Cap”) until the Issuer receives the stockholder approval (“Stockholder Approval”)
required under Rule 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual for the removal of the Conversion Cap.
The Issuer has the right to cause the
conversion of all the Preferred Shares if, for a period of 30 consecutive trading days, the volume-weighted average price of the
Common Stock (as displayed on Bloomberg) exceeds a 200% premium of the Conversion Price.
The Series A Preferred Shares have the
right to vote together with the holders of Common Stock on all matters on which the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote.
The holders of Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock that would be issuable to the holder
upon conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Shares held by such holder.
The Series A Preferred Shares will rank
senior to the Common Stock with respect to rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution.
 6 

 
 

From and after May 22, 2017, the Series
A Preferred Shares will accrue dividends at a rate of 9% per annum, payable at the Issuer’s election either as an increase
in the Stated Value of the Series A Preferred Shares or in cash.
The Issuer will have the right to redeem
all (but not less than all) of the Series A Preferred Shares at its option with at least thirty days’ notice to the holders
of the Series A Preferred Shares for a per share redemption price equal to (a) for any redemption occurring prior to October 22,
2018, the product of the Stated Value and 1.75 and (b) for any redemption occurring on or after October 22, 2018, the greater of
(x) the product of the Stated Value and 2.00 and (y) an amount equal to the number of shares of Common Stock such Preferred Share
is convertible into at the time of the redemption, multiplied by the 30-day volume weighted average price of the Common Stock prior
to such redemption.
Series B Preferred
Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations,
each Series B Preferred Share is convertible, subject to the Conversion Cap, at any time after the Closing Date into a Series A
Preferred Share and will automatically convert into a Series A Preferred Share upon receipt of Stockholder Approval. The Series
B Preferred Shares have the same designations, preferences and other rights (and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions)
as do the Series A Preferred Shares, except (i) a Series B Preferred Share may not be converted into a Series A Preferred
Share and then into shares of Common Stock if doing so would breach the Conversion Cap, (ii) the Series B Preferred Shares
generally do not entitle their holders to vote on any matters submitted to a vote of the Issuer’s stockholders, and (iii) the
Series B Preferred Shares will accrue dividends at a rate of 11% per annum if Stockholder Approval is not obtained by September
19, 2017.
Investor Rights Agreement
In connection with the acquisition of
the Preferred Shares, the Issuer and TPG Growth Sidewall entered into Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2017 (the
“Investor Rights Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement,
TPG Growth Sidewall, for as long as it holds at least 50% of the Preferred Shares issued to it on the Closing Date (including any
shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred Shares are converted), shall be entitled to designate a nominee to the board of
directors of the Issuer. On the Closing Date, TPG Growth Sidewall designated Ransom Langford, an affiliate of TPG Growth Sidewall,
and Mr. Langford was appointed to the board of directors.
The Investor Rights Agreement provides
for customary demand and piggyback registration rights for TPG Growth Sidewall and its transferees beginning one year after the
Closing Date. The Investor Rights Agreement also contains customary transfer restrictions for one year, subject to certain exceptions,
and provides TPG Growth Sidewall pre-emptive rights to participate in future equity issuances of the Issuer for so long as it holds
at least 50% of the Preferred Shares issued to it on the Closing Date (including any shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred
Shares are converted).
Other
than as described above, none of the Reporting Persons nor, to the best knowledge of each of the Reporting Persons, without
independent verification, any of the persons listed in Schedule I hereto, currently has any plans or proposals that relate
to, or would result in, any of the matters listed in Items 4(a)–(j) of Schedule 13D, although the Reporting Persons
may, at any time and from time to time, review or reconsider their position and/or change their purpose and/or formulate
plans or proposals with respect thereto. As a result of these activities, one or more of the Reporting Persons may suggest or
take a position with respect to potential changes in the operations, management or capital structure of the Issuer as a means
of enhancing shareholder value. Such suggestions or positions may include one or more plans or proposals that relate to or
would result in any of the actions required to be reported herein, including, without limitation, such matters as acquiring
additional securities of the Issuer or disposing of securities of the Issuer; entering into an extraordinary corporate
transaction such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; selling or
transferring a material amount of assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; changing the present board of directors or
management of the Issuer, including changing the number or term of directors or filling any existing vacancies on the board
of directors of the Issuer; materially changing the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; materially
changing the Issuer’s business or corporate structure; changing the Issuer’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or instruments corresponding thereto or taking other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any
person; causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be
authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; causing a class
of equity securities of the Issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and taking any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:

 Every other quarter
