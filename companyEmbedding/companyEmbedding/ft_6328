Top brandsView moreSpiff up your house with essential home improvement tools A little maintenance goes a long way toward keeping your home in tip-top shape and ultimately saving you money on repairs later on. At Walmart, you can find everything you need for home maintenance and improvement, so you can get your to-do list done sooner. Paint and home decor Painting your home can be a huge project, but with paints, primers and supplies from Walmart, you can get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible, no matter your budget. you'll find more than 700 custom colors in Walmart's paint shop. Just select your color, buy a gallon or sample and then have it delivered to your home or local Walmart. Spruce up your place with a wide variety of paints: indoor, outdoor, ceiling, primer, appliance, concrete and garage floor paint. You can also wow your guests with wallpaper, decals and borders. Find all the necessary tools and supplies to get the job done right. Wallpaper provides a great way for you to decorate your home to suit your own unique tastes. Plus you can incorporate patterns and themes into your wall customization without needing any special artistic talents. From botanical prints to modern geometric patterns, there are plenty of options to choose from. If you have trouble reaching those high up places, Walmart has a fine selection of ladders, step stools and scaffolding to get you there safely. Heating and cooling systems Before buying a heating system, determine the amount of heat you need (in BTUs) by deciding the temperature increase you'd like and multiplying it by the cubic footage of the area you need to warm up. Decide whether you want a radiant or convection heater and whether you'd prefer electric heat, propane, natural gas or oil. For cooling, the inexpensive solution is simply a fan. You can select between a rotating pedestal or tower fans or try a box fan that fits into your window space. If you have more than one box fan, it will create an air flow that could cool an entire floor of your home. Of course, air conditioners provide a cooler atmosphere than a fan. Like heat, the cooling power of an air conditioner is measured in BTUs, so the higher the BTUs, the larger the space it will be equipped to handle. Choose between wall-mounted window units or portable air conditioners. Wall-mounted and window ACs require some minor installation. they're stationary, while portable air conditioners can simply be plugged in and moved from one room to another. Power tools Power tools are often more efficient than hand tools and are vital to many projects. Selecting the right power tool is the key to getting a job done right. power drills are used to make holes and install fasteners, like screws. These tasks are common to many a home improvement project, so a power drill is a useful item in its own right. Nail guns drive nails into wood and other materials. Hammers are sufficient for lots of smaller projects, but a nail gun is useful if the task involves a lot of nails or if they have to be driven into hard materials. Power saws can cut through lots of different materials. There are many different types of power saws, so choose one that's appropriate for the material you're working with and consider whether you need a portable saw. Power sanders round off sharp edges and smooth surfaces more quickly and efficiently than sandpaper alone. A power sander is worth getting if you're doing a project that involves large pieces of wood. bench grinders are used for sharpening other tools and for removing rust. Meanwhile, angle grinders help to alter metal and masonry materials, like tile. Other popular categories of home improvement products include: Garage and Storage - shelves and racks, cabinets and storage systems like bins and totes plus garage door openers Outdoor Power Equipment - lawn mowers and trimmers Bathroom Renovation - fixtures and shower materials, plus plumbing and hardware Kitchen Renovation - sinks, faucets, plumbing and hardware Hardware - tie downs, fasteners, door and cabinet hardware Water and Air Purification - air filters and water coolers Generators - portable, standby and inverter generators plus general accessories Electrical and Lighting - light bulbs, swatches and wall plates, tools and general electrical merchandise Walmart also has everything you need for plumbing, home security, electrical maintenance and repair and much more to make your home improvement efforts as easy as possible.

                    What a great place to call home. Albany has so very much to offer. The city parks and rec department has a vast array of activities that are available to the public. In the summer months the Cool Pool is open at Swanson Park, "The pool features a zero depth entry and is 4.5' deep at its deepest. COOL! has a 36' high slide and a Lazy River. The play structure is surrounded by a large amount of water that is only 18" deep". Albany also hosts a concert series every summer called River Rhythms at Monteith Park where vendors sell food and drink. The summer of 2017 will host artists such at Tracey Lawrence, John Michael Montgomery, a Michael Jackson tribute concert, Pablo Cruise and more. Albany also has a community garden and a Saturday market. If you are a dog owner you can enjoy our dog park. If you are adventurous we have a skate park too. Our library has 2 locations and children's storybook times that run Monday through Friday. For the older individual try one of the many activities at the Albany Senior Center. We will soon have the Carousel open too. All of these wonderful activities are available to the public and much much more.

                    Coming this summer (2017) our long anticipated historic carousel will be open!  It will be a great place for the entire family!  Volunteers from all over have come to donate their time(more than 160,000 volunteer hours) and talents to create the most beautiful hand-carved carousel animals you can imagine!!  My family is very excited to visit this coming attraction!
