Jordan Healthcare has made a healthy home lifestyle possible for the elderly throughout Texas since 1975. Jordan provides both skilled and unskilled home health services, including nursing, personal assistance, tele-home care and pediatric care for Medicaid and Medicare recipients, as well as people covered by insurance or private funds. With 12,000 employees, Jordan makes a difference in the health and wellbeing of thousands of individuals every day with carefully designed care programs that meet the needs of patients.Working with management, Trinity Hunt assisted Jordan in building its senior management team, as well as implementing new software systems to manage nurse staffing, scheduling and reporting. We also led a series of acquisitions on behalf of the Company which, in connection with organic growth, led to 20% profit growth per year. In December of 2010, Jordan Healthcare was successfully exited to a NY-based private equity firm.

Healthcare Holdings Group, Inc.'s EHR And PHR Product Line Protects Customers From Patent Infringement






Healthcare Holdings Group, Inc. (HCH) extends patent infringement protection to its customer-base through a recently signed nonexclusive Patent License Agreement.

	Boca Raton, FL (PRWEB) - Healthcare Holdings Group, Inc. (HCH) extends patent infringement protection to its customer-base through a recently signed nonexclusive Patent License Agreement with MyMedicalRecords, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of MMRGlobal (OTC: MMRF). Established in the Personal Health Records (PHR) market with AccessMyRecords.com since 2005, HCH breaks into the Electronic Health Records (EHR) market with MU compliance and customer-base protection as a guiding force for their HIMSS13 multi-product launch—the highly anticipated release of ChartZoneMD EHR Software Suite for General Practitioners and Chiropractic disciplines.

	"Industry standards are an integral part to the successful implementation, trust, and public acceptance of HIE [Health Information Exchange] and related markets. In recognition of MMR's recent patent approvals—specific to providing online medical records—we feel the investment towards compliance is a responsible protective measure with direct benefit to our clients and shareholders,” said Leonard Tambasco, Chairman and CEO of Healthcare Holdings Group, Inc. Of the nonexclusive Patent License Agreement with MMR, Mr. Tambasco said, “This Agreement solidifies HCH’s position to enhance and continually support industry-wide standardization efforts."

	According to Robert H. Lorsch, Chairman and CEO, MMRGlobal “HCH customer agreements warrant and represent that they have all necessary rights to offer their products and services. This Agreement demonstrates that HCH takes that representation seriously by acquiring the necessary Intellectual Property rights to protect their customers.”

	An additional market advantage unique to Healthcare Holdings Group, Inc. is their product line’s ability to provide doctors and clinicians with a series of free-standing or add-on modules—like their Patient Portal or SmartFormsMD Voice-Command Module with Medical Dictionary—to be used with other EHR software environments. HCH will launch their MU compliant EHR at HIMSS13.

About MMRGlobal, Inc. 
	MMRGlobal, Inc., through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, MyMedicalRecords, Inc., provides secure and easy-to-use online Personal Health Records ("PHRs") and electronic safe deposit box storage solutions, serving consumers, healthcare professionals, employers, insurance companies, financial institutions, and professional organizations and affinity groups. The MyMedicalRecords PHR enables individuals and families to access their medical records and other important documents, such as birth certificates, passports, insurance policies and wills, anytime from anywhere using the Internet. MyMedicalRecords is built on proprietary, patented technologies to allow documents, images and voicemail messages to be transmitted and stored in the system using a variety of methods, including fax, phone, or file upload without relying on any specific electronic medical record platform to populate a user's account. The Company's professional offering, MMRPro, is designed to give physicians' offices an easy and cost-effective solution to digitizing paper-based medical records and sharing them with patients in real time through an integrated patient portal. Through its merger with Favrille, Inc. in January 2009, the Company acquired intellectual property biotech assets that include anti-CD20 antibodies and data and samples from its FavId™/Specifid™ vaccine clinical trials for the treatment of B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

AccessMyRecords.com is built on proprietary technologies and facilitates bi-directional communication featured in its free-standing Patient Portal. ChartZoneMD EHR Software Suite is HCH’s newest multi-featured product line designed to give General Practitioners and Chiropractic disciplines an easy and cost-effective cloud-based practice management solution. The comprehensive suite of applications and tools allow clinicians to seamlessly shift from paper charts to the recently mandated Meaningful Use EHR format and audit-reporting styles. In addition, HCH has developed SmartFormsMD, a free-standing voice-command module complete with medical dictionary integration, specialty accommodation, and a host of customizable options. The ChartZoneMD Software Suite enables real-time sharing of medical records with patients, via the AMR integrated patient-portal module. Both AMR and SmartFormsMD are adaptable software modules to any 3rd Party EHR.
