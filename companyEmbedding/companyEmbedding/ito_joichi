Family and education[edit]




Joi Ito (c.1981)


Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. Company founder Stanford R. Ovshinsky was impressed with Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky helped Ito develop his interests in technology and social movements, and at age 13 gave him work with scientists, saying, "He was not a child in the conventional sense."[11]
Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, who is called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother who taught them traditional Japanese culture.[12] At 14, he returned to Japan when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School[13] and for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo.[14] Ito also learned "street language, street smarts, and computers". One of few Japanese using modems before deregulation of networking reached Japan in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26 was working on his own MUD).[12]
Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University near Boston as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay.[15] Finding his course work too rigid and believing that learning computer science in school was "stupid",[15] Ito dropped out of Tufts to briefly work for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but dropped out on discovering, in his opinion, the program at Chicago to be more oriented towards producing practical engineers than towards teaching an intuitive understanding of physics.[11] In the Fall of 1985 he became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research.
Ito is one of Timothy Leary's godsons—a close non-traditional family-like relationship, an idea said to have been conceived by Leary for a few of his friends.[16][17] Ito's sister is Mizuko Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).
Later life[edit]
Ito became a disk jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as The Limelight and The Smart Bar and to work with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo.[12] Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan called XY Relax with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.

In recent years, Ito has become critical of what he sees as Japan's inward focus. He stated in a 2011 interview that he thinks Japan needs to look internationally if it is to continue to be "relevant".[34]

MIT Media Lab[edit]
The New York Times reported in April 2011 that Joi Ito was named to be the director of the MIT Media Lab. His appointment was called an "unusual choice" since Ito studied at two colleges, but did not finish his degrees. "The choice is radical, but brilliant," said Larry Smarr, director of Calit2.[62] Ito officially began his role on September 1, 2011.[1][63] He was appointed Professor of the Practice of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, effective July 1, 2016.[64]
Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab's co-founder and chairman emeritus, described the choice as bringing the media to "Joi's world".[65] In an interview with Asian Scientist Magazine, Joi Ito discusses his vision for the MIT Media Lab, and how he likes the word “learning” better than the word “education”.[66]

His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics.

Family and education[edit]




Joi Ito (c.1981)


Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. Company founder Stanford R. Ovshinsky was impressed with Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky helped Ito develop his interests in technology and social movements, and at age 13 gave him work with scientists, saying, "He was not a child in the conventional sense."[11]
Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, who is called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother who taught them traditional Japanese culture.[12] At 14, he returned to Japan when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School[13] and for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo.[14] Ito also learned "street language, street smarts, and computers". One of few Japanese using modems before deregulation of networking reached Japan in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26 was working on his own MUD).[12]
Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University near Boston as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay.[15] Finding his course work too rigid and believing that learning computer science in school was "stupid",[15] Ito dropped out of Tufts to briefly work for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but dropped out on discovering, in his opinion, the program at Chicago to be more oriented towards producing practical engineers than towards teaching an intuitive understanding of physics.[11] In the Fall of 1985 he became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research.
Ito is one of Timothy Leary's godsons—a close non-traditional family-like relationship, an idea said to have been conceived by Leary for a few of his friends.[16][17] Ito's sister is Mizuko Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).
Later life[edit]
Ito became a disk jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as The Limelight and The Smart Bar and to work with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo.[12] Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan called XY Relax with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.

Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab's co-founder and chairman emeritus, described the choice as bringing the media to "Joi's world".[65] In an interview with Asian Scientist Magazine, Joi Ito discusses his vision for the MIT Media Lab, and how he likes the word “learning” better than the word “education”.[66]

Family and education[edit]




Joi Ito (c.1981)


Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. Company founder Stanford R. Ovshinsky was impressed with Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky helped Ito develop his interests in technology and social movements, and at age 13 gave him work with scientists, saying, "He was not a child in the conventional sense."[11]
Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, who is called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother who taught them traditional Japanese culture.[12] At 14, he returned to Japan when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School[13] and for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo.[14] Ito also learned "street language, street smarts, and computers". One of few Japanese using modems before deregulation of networking reached Japan in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26 was working on his own MUD).[12]
Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University near Boston as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay.[15] Finding his course work too rigid and believing that learning computer science in school was "stupid",[15] Ito dropped out of Tufts to briefly work for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but dropped out on discovering, in his opinion, the program at Chicago to be more oriented towards producing practical engineers than towards teaching an intuitive understanding of physics.[11] In the Fall of 1985 he became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research.
Ito is one of Timothy Leary's godsons—a close non-traditional family-like relationship, an idea said to have been conceived by Leary for a few of his friends.[16][17] Ito's sister is Mizuko Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).
Later life[edit]
Ito became a disk jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as The Limelight and The Smart Bar and to work with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo.[12] Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan called XY Relax with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.

He is the author of Emergent Democracy.[30] Ito is Senior Visiting Researcher of Keio Research Institute at SFC.[31] In May 2011, it was announced that Ito's company, Digital Garage, will provide PR, marketing, product marketing research and market research for Linkedin Japan.[32]
Ito is a PADI IDC Staff Instructor, an Emergency First Responder Instructor Trainer, and a Divers Alert Network (DAN) Instructor Trainer.[33]
In recent years, Ito has become critical of what he sees as Japan's inward focus. He stated in a 2011 interview that he thinks Japan needs to look internationally if it is to continue to be "relevant".[34]
Journalism[edit]
Ito has written opinion editorials for the Asian Wall Street Journal[35] and The New York Times[36][37] and has published articles in numerous other magazines[38] and newspapers. He has had regular columns in The Daily Yomiuri, Mac World Japan, Asahi Pasocom, Asahi Doors, and other media sources. His photographs have been used in The New York Times Online,[39] BusinessWeek,[40] American Heritage,[41] Wired News,[42] Forbes,[43] and BBC News.[44] He was on the early editorial mastheads of Wired and Mondo 2000. He has authored and co-authored a number of books including Dialog – Ryu Murakami X Joichi Ito with Ryu Murakami, and "Freesouls: Captured and Released" with Christopher Adams, a book of Ito's photographs that includes essays by several prominent figures in the free culture movement.[45] He has hosted televisions shows including The New Breed and SimTV shows on NHK.

MIT Media Lab[edit]

"The choice is radical, but brilliant," said Larry Smarr, director of Calit2.[62] Ito officially began his role on September 1, 2011.[1][63] He was appointed Professor of the Practice of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, effective July 1, 2016.[64]
Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab's co-founder and chairman emeritus, described the choice as bringing the media to "Joi's world".[65] In an interview with Asian Scientist Magazine, Joi Ito discusses his vision for the MIT Media Lab, and how he likes the word “learning” better than the word “education”.[66]

Family and education[edit]




Joi Ito (c.1981)


Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. Company founder Stanford R. Ovshinsky was impressed with Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky helped Ito develop his interests in technology and social movements, and at age 13 gave him work with scientists, saying, "He was not a child in the conventional sense."[11]
Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, who is called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother who taught them traditional Japanese culture.[12] At 14, he returned to Japan when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School[13] and for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo.[14] Ito also learned "street language, street smarts, and computers". One of few Japanese using modems before deregulation of networking reached Japan in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26 was working on his own MUD).[12]
Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University near Boston as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay.[15] Finding his course work too rigid and believing that learning computer science in school was "stupid",[15] Ito dropped out of Tufts to briefly work for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but dropped out on discovering, in his opinion, the program at Chicago to be more oriented towards producing practical engineers than towards teaching an intuitive understanding of physics.[11] In the Fall of 1985 he became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research.
Ito is one of Timothy Leary's godsons—a close non-traditional family-like relationship, an idea said to have been conceived by Leary for a few of his friends.[16][17] Ito's sister is Mizuko Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).
Later life[edit]
Ito became a disk jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as The Limelight and The Smart Bar and to work with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo.[12] Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan called XY Relax with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.

In August 2005, he joined the board of the Mozilla Foundation[22] and served until April 2016. He served on the board of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) from March 2005 until April 2007. He currently serves as a Board Emeritus for OSI.[15] He was a founding board member of Expression College for Digital Arts[23] as well as the Zero One Art and Technology Network.[24] In 1999, he served as the Associate to Mr. Mount (the executive producer) on the film The Indian Runner.[25] Ito also served as a Board Member of Energy Conversion Devices from 1995 to 2000.
Ito is a venture capitalist and angel investor and was an early stage investor in Kickstarter,[26] Twitter,[27] Six Apart, Technorati, Flickr, SocialText, Dopplr, Last.fm, Rupture, Kongregate, Fotopedia, Diffbot, Formlabs, 3Dsolve and other Internet companies.[28][29] A vocal advocate of emergent democracy and the sharing economy, Ito is a doctoral candidate in Business Administration focusing on the sharing economy at the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy, Hitotsubashi University. He is the author of Emergent Democracy.[30] Ito is Senior Visiting Researcher of Keio Research Institute at SFC.[31] In May 2011, it was announced that Ito's company, Digital Garage, will provide PR, marketing, product marketing research and market research for Linkedin Japan.[32]
Ito is a PADI IDC Staff Instructor, an Emergency First Responder Instructor Trainer, and a Divers Alert Network (DAN) Instructor Trainer.[33]
In recent years, Ito has become critical of what he sees as Japan's inward focus. He stated in a 2011 interview that he thinks Japan needs to look internationally if it is to continue to be "relevant".[34]
Journalism[edit]
Ito has written opinion editorials for the Asian Wall Street Journal[35] and The New York Times[36][37] and has published articles in numerous other magazines[38] and newspapers. He has had regular columns in The Daily Yomiuri, Mac World Japan, Asahi Pasocom, Asahi Doors, and other media sources. His photographs have been used in The New York Times Online,[39] BusinessWeek,[40] American Heritage,[41] Wired News,[42] Forbes,[43] and BBC News.[44] He was on the early editorial mastheads of Wired and Mondo 2000. He has authored and co-authored a number of books including Dialog – Ryu Murakami X Joichi Ito with Ryu Murakami, and "Freesouls: Captured and Released" with Christopher Adams, a book of Ito's photographs that includes essays by several prominent figures in the free culture movement.[45] He has hosted televisions shows including The New Breed and SimTV shows on NHK.
He is currently the host of a TV show called "Super-Presentation" airing weekly in Japan on NHK.[46]
Media "lists" and honors[edit]
Ito was listed by Time magazine as a member of the "Cyber-Elite" in 1997. He was also named one of the 50 "Stars of Asia" in the "Entrepreneurs and Dealmakers" category by BusinessWeek[47] and commended by the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for supporting the advancement of IT in 2000.[48] He was selected by the World Economic Forum in 2001 as one of the "Global Leaders for Tomorrow"[49] and chosen by Newsweek as a member of the "Leaders of The Pack (high technology industry)" in 2005,[50] and listed by Vanity Fair as a member of "The Next Establishment" in the October Issue, 2007[51] and 2011.[52] Joi Ito was also named by BusinessWeek as one of the 25 Most Influential People on the Web in 2008.[53] On July 22, 2011 he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his role as one of the world's leading advocates of Internet freedom from the University of Oxford Internet Institute.[54] In 2011, with Ethan Zuckerman, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers, in which he stated the Best idea is "Users controlling their own data".[55] Ito received the degree of Doctor of Literature, honoris causa, from The New School in 2013.[56] On March 11, 2014, Ito was inducted into the SXSW Interactive Festival Hall of Fame.[57] He was a TED speaker at the March 21, TED2014.[58] In 2014, Ito was awarded the Golden Plate Award by the Academy of Achievement.[59] On May 17, 2015 Ito received a Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, from Tufts University.[60] On May 11, 2017 Ito was awarded the IRI Medal.[61]
MIT Media Lab[edit]
The New York Times reported in April 2011 that Joi Ito was named to be the director of the MIT Media Lab. His appointment was called an "unusual choice" since Ito studied at two colleges, but did not finish his degrees. "The choice is radical, but brilliant," said Larry Smarr, director of Calit2.[62] Ito officially began his role on September 1, 2011.[1][63] He was appointed Professor of the Practice of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, effective July 1, 2016.[64]
Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab's co-founder and chairman emeritus, described the choice as bringing the media to "Joi's world".[65] In an interview with Asian Scientist Magazine, Joi Ito discusses his vision for the MIT Media Lab, and how he likes the word “learning” better than the word “education”.[66]

Family and education[edit]




Joi Ito (c.1981)


Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. Company founder Stanford R. Ovshinsky was impressed with Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky helped Ito develop his interests in technology and social movements, and at age 13 gave him work with scientists, saying, "He was not a child in the conventional sense."[11]
Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, who is called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother who taught them traditional Japanese culture.[12] At 14, he returned to Japan when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School[13] and for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo.[14] Ito also learned "street language, street smarts, and computers". One of few Japanese using modems before deregulation of networking reached Japan in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26 was working on his own MUD).[12]
Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University near Boston as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay.[15] Finding his course work too rigid and believing that learning computer science in school was "stupid",[15] Ito dropped out of Tufts to briefly work for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but dropped out on discovering, in his opinion, the program at Chicago to be more oriented towards producing practical engineers than towards teaching an intuitive understanding of physics.[11] In the Fall of 1985 he became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research.
Ito is one of Timothy Leary's godsons—a close non-traditional family-like relationship, an idea said to have been conceived by Leary for a few of his friends.[16][17] Ito's sister is Mizuko Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).
Later life[edit]
Ito became a disk jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as The Limelight and The Smart Bar and to work with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo.[12] Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan called XY Relax with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.

MIT Media Lab[edit]
The New York Times reported in April 2011 that Joi Ito was named to be the director of the MIT Media Lab.

"The choice is radical, but brilliant," said Larry Smarr, director of Calit2.[62] Ito officially began his role on September 1, 2011.[1][63] He was appointed Professor of the Practice of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, effective July 1, 2016.[64]

Family and education[edit]




Joi Ito (c.1981)


Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then when Ito was about age 3 to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States where his father became a research scientist[10] and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. Company founder Stanford R. Ovshinsky was impressed with Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky helped Ito develop his interests in technology and social movements, and at age 13 gave him work with scientists, saying, "He was not a child in the conventional sense."[11]
Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, who is called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother who taught them traditional Japanese culture.[12] At 14, he returned to Japan when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School[13] and for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo.[14] Ito also learned "street language, street smarts, and computers". One of few Japanese using modems before deregulation of networking reached Japan in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26 was working on his own MUD).[12]
Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University near Boston as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay.[15] Finding his course work too rigid and believing that learning computer science in school was "stupid",[15] Ito dropped out of Tufts to briefly work for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but dropped out on discovering, in his opinion, the program at Chicago to be more oriented towards producing practical engineers than towards teaching an intuitive understanding of physics.[11] In the Fall of 1985 he became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research.
Ito is one of Timothy Leary's godsons—a close non-traditional family-like relationship, an idea said to have been conceived by Leary for a few of his friends.[16][17] Ito's sister is Mizuko Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).
Later life[edit]
Ito became a disk jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as The Limelight and The Smart Bar and to work with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo.[12] Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan called XY Relax with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.

MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito on Innovation







The availability of open-source software and the low cost of communications and collaboration technologies have made Silicon Valley-like innovation less risky for large, established companies.

On March 11, 2011, when entrepreneur and venture capitalist Joi Ito was interviewing for his current job as director of the MIT Media Lab, an earthquake and tsunami rocked his birth country of Japan. Seeking accurate and trustworthy information about the 9.0 magnitude quake and its impact on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Ito tapped the power of the internet and organized dozens of friends, colleagues, and strangers online.
Members of the skunkworks group pooled their skills. Using open-source software, hardware, and other components, they built and deployed more than 1,000 Geiger counters to detect the amount of radiation exposure from the damaged power plant. Volunteers in Japan installed the devices on cars and drove around the country collecting data. Over the last five years, the counters have gathered 48 million data points, creating, according to Ito’s estimate, the largest open data set in the world.
“When we undertook this effort, government officials criticized us, saying, ‘You’re amateurs. What do you know about nuclear emissions?’ But we ended up beating every government agency and non-governmental organization in terms of the volume and quality of our work, and we did it with very little money—about $150,000 in funding from the Knight Foundation, a Kickstarter campaign, and individual donors,” says Ito. “Many of the scientists who initially questioned us later wanted to collaborate.”
This effort, which grew into the open-citizen science initiative Safecast, exemplifies what Ito calls an engineering-driven innovation model, in which individuals with a desire to build something can do so relatively quickly and easily by capitalizing on free and open-source software and low-cost communication and collaboration technologies. Ito says this innovation model appears repeatedly in the consumer internet space and is moving into the manufacturing and industrial internet sectors as well.
The engineering-driven innovation model contrasts with the MBA-driven approach many large, established companies use, in which, according to Ito, innovation teams write proposals and make presentations in order to get permission and funding. He understands big companies take a more conservative approach because the level of risk is so much higher than for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. “In big companies, you worry about downside: You might exceed your budget. The market might flip over,” he says. “In contrast, I have no fear when I invest money in a company because the top two performing organizations in my portfolio are each worth more than the rest of the portfolio combined. This approach allows me to amplify winners and write off losers. That’s very different from the circumstances in large companies.”
Given the low cost of innovation today, the risk is lower than big companies realize. For that reason, Ito believes companies should reconsider their attachment to the MBA-driven approach to innovation and embrace the engineering-driven model.
Ito points out that engineering-driven innovation is transforming smaller factories in Shenzhen, China, and urges American manufacturers to take note. He says the entrepreneurial mindset and passion for learning among factory workers in Shenzen have given them the ability to move seamlessly from, say, textile manufacturing to electronics, and has led some to develop new smartphones. One factory worker developed a phone that retails for $8 with many of the features—including an OLED screen, lithium battery, MP3 player, and SMS texting capability—consumers expect from high-end products. “These workers are literally sitting on the factory floor designing prototypes,” says Ito. “Their motto is, ‘If you don’t have tooling grease under your fingernails, you’re not a real designer.’ They’re a force to be reckoned with. You don’t get this kind of innovation when a designer and manufacturing engineer have to exchange PowerPoint presentations.”
The next major innovation Ito urges executives to watch is synthetic biology, in which principles and practices from biology and engineering are combined to redesign existing biological components and systems, and even fabricate new ones. DuPont’s Sorona® biopolymer fiber is an example—Ito says it’s now created using a microbe that converts amino acids and sugars to fabric materials 30 percent more efficiently than traditional manufacturing methods. In other areas of synthetic biology, engineers are “reprogramming” bacteria to produce a range of products, including biofuels and arsenic sensors.
While Ito is enthusiastic about synthetic biology, he sounds a warning about one area of innovation currently garnering much attention: the blockchain. He believes the distributed ledger technology will reinvent many aspects of financial services, but the billion dollars’ worth of venture money flowing into the space has put the industry “ahead of its skis” and led to the creation of some unreasonably aggressive or poorly designed businesses. He urges developers to focus on the stability, security, and fundamental theory behind the technology and to proceed with caution.
“In the past, if you wanted to develop a new product or service from the bottom up, it would have cost millions to billions of dollars,” says Ito. “Now the cost of innovation is so low that you no longer need money as much as you need capabilities.”

IT’s Transformation Journey Continues

                          IT has already undergone considerable evolution, but there’s still much more to come. The next phase of transformation will likely put new focus on the way IT operates, how it collaborates with business and external partners, and how its development teams can work smarter and more efficiently to deliver services.
                        



Manufacturing USA: The Power of the Ecosystem

                          How can any one organization keep up with the ever-increasing pace of technological change? Join forces to create an ecosystem and work together for more efficient innovation. That’s one of many lessons to be learned from the example of Manufacturing USA, which now includes 14 technology-focused institutes.
                        



Fintech Innovation in ‘Silicon Wadi’

                          Tel Aviv, Israel, has emerged as a leading technology development hub. Many startups there are pushing the bounds of fintech, and incubators are providing the support they need for knowledge-sharing, collaboration, innovation, and a digitally enabled employee experience.

A Time of Change, Growth for CIOs

                          A confluence of disruptive forces is straining current IT operating models, prompting many CIOs to craft new strategies, structures, and processes to transform IT’s engagement with the business and deliver more value. The effect of these changes is likewise disrupting the CIO role, forcing CIOs to thinking deeply about the personal attributes and behaviors they will need to succeed.
                        



The Hard but Important Work of Technology Strategy

                          Narrowly defined, utilitarian IT strategies are a thing of the past. Many C-level leadership teams and CIOs are now hard at work crafting complex, ambitious technology strategy and transformation plans in lockstep with the business. Peter Vanderslice, a principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP and co-lead of the CIO Program, shares his perspectives on these efforts. Spoiler alert: There are no shortcuts.
                        



9 Competencies Help CIOs Become Business Leaders

                          Businesses need CIOs to move beyond traditional back-office operational tasks to bring more value to the enterprise. Competencies that help CIOs improve operational excellence, develop leadership talents, and build entrepreneurial skills enable them to transition from technology leaders to business leaders.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

If we destroy human rights and rule of law in the response to terrorism, they have won.
Joichi Ito


Law,
Terrorism,
Human



















Most creative work is a process of people passing ideas and inspirations from the past into the future and adding their own creativity along the way.
Joichi Ito


Work,
Future,
Creativity
























There was a very convincing argument made that the extremists have won and the aggression is now supported by the majority, therefore fighting until surrender was the only alternative.
Joichi Ito


Fighting,
Argument,
Now



















I agree that it is not just the extremists who harbor bad thoughts or engage in bad acts, but they are usually the source of the polarization and try to keep education and communication of the main stream from moving forward.
Joichi Ito


Education,
Communication



















Google is in an amazing position to be the target of tons of lawsuits that will set precedent for many important things for us on the Internet.
Joichi Ito


Amazing,
Important,
Internet



















I talked about the barriers created by monopolies. I said that it was the role of government to break up these monopolies and that we couldn't do it alone.
Joichi Ito


Alone,
Government,
Said



















Liberty, freedom and democracy are very fuzzy words, but human rights is very specific.
Joichi Ito


Freedom,
Words,
Liberty



















The US constitution's First Amendment rights only cover Americans, but I believe that in a democracy the competition of ideas and free speech should combat beliefs that it does not agree with - more speech and debate, not censorship.
Joichi Ito


Competition,
Believe,
Free



















I just believe that the cost of marketing is going to increase and the cost of delivery is going to decrease as the Net gets stronger and mass media gets weaker.
Joichi Ito


Believe,
Marketing,
Stronger
























In a world where discovery is more important than delivery, it's the people who find, remix and direct attention to old stuff that should be rewarded, not the people who deliver it or sit on it waiting for someone to show up.
Joichi Ito


Waiting,
World,
People



















We have a long way to go before we are able to hear the voices of everyone on earth, but I believe that providing voices and building bridges is essential for the World Peace we all wish for.
Joichi Ito


Peace,
World,
Believe

Help,
Ambassador

Joichi Ito


Work,
Broken,
Democracy



















The idea of trying to fight against extremism was written off as naive.
Joichi Ito


Fight,
Trying,
Naive
























I have had a great deal of interaction with Koreans and feel a fairly strong bond with Korea.
Joichi Ito


Great,
Strong,
Bond



















For some reason, I grew up generally believing that Japan and Korea were quite friendly. I do know that there is some bad history and the extremists on both sides are unreasonable.
Joichi Ito


History,
Know,
Bad



















I definitely feel like my blog is going edgy to broad and boring.
Joichi Ito


Boring,
Feel,
Going



















We discussed the history of postwar Japan and how Japan had missed an opportunity to build a more functional democracy because of the focus on fighting communism driven in large part by the American occupation.
Joichi Ito


History,
Focus,
Opportunity



















We talked about the Internet and Wikipedia and how facts and history are being collectively created online.
Joichi Ito


History,
Internet,
Facts



















But my question is, am I compromising by adapting my words for the audience and where is the line beyond which I am not adapting words, but changing my position?
Joichi Ito


I Am,
Words,
Audience



















Money creates a power relationship between the payer and the payee.
Joichi Ito


Relationship,
Money,
Power
























Internet penetration in Italy is quite low and the Berlusconi media machine controls most of what people see.
Joichi Ito


People,
Media,
Italy



















When there is a huge force pressing down on freedoms, sub-cultures with more creativity and power are likely to form.
Joichi Ito


Creativity,
Power,
Down



















It would be easy to define terrorism as attacks against human rights and international humanitarian law forbids attacks against innocent non-combatants which is often the definition used for terrorism.
Joichi Ito


Law,
Terrorism,
Human



















Upholding human rights is not merely compatible with fighting terrorism, it is essential.
Joichi Ito


Terrorism,
Human,
Fighting

Risk and reward: Joi Ito on what news orgs could learn from tech companies about innovation
The director of the MIT Media Lab compares the worlds of media and tech, and says  “When you’re sinking, you have two ways to go: You can bet the house on something, go all in, or you can try to become smaller and smaller until you disappear.”

What’s one of the most important things that drives innovation? Risk, according to Joi Ito, head of MIT’s Media Lab. The willingness to take risks and accept what comes with them is what can lead to the creation of new tools, technologies, or systems that can change society.
And therein lies the problem — or at least one of the problems — when it comes to innovating in the world of journalism, Ito says. While journalists are known to take risk in their jobs, it’s done in the course of reporting a story. But the risk involved in starting or operating a business — or in making radical changes to how an existing business is run — is something else entirely. Two professions often exposed to risk, journalists and lawyers, can also be the most averse to it, Ito says.
“The problem with journalists, I find, and lawyers, is they understand risk very well. But they’ve never taken it,” Ito said at a recent event at the Media Lab, sponsored by the Boston chapter of Hacks/Hackers. 
That’s specifically true, Ito said, when it comes to fundamental financial risk. “Lawyers and journalists are so protected from personal risks that they make the worst kind of risk takers,” he said.
What Ito was talking about more broadly is how journalists can manage innovation and change within their own companies at a time when innovation seems to be popping up anywhere other than newsrooms. Ito and Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT spoke at the gathering about the challenges journalist face in trying to create new products and transform the business models surrounding them.
Ito’s background blends the worlds of tech, civic activism, and media. He’s been an early investor in companies like Twitter and Kickstarter, and he sits on the board of The New York Times Co., Creative Commons, and Knight Foundation, among others. It’s with that experience that Ito contrasts the experiences of trying to develop new products and ideas as an entrepreneur versus a large media company. 
Everything in media, as well as how people react to it, is changing, Ito said. Consumption habits are transforming, our devices are changing each year, and media coverage is shifting as well. These things together are at the heart of people’s connection to — and participation in — their community, Ito said. That’s why it’s so important journalism finds a way to transform, he said.
Risk is one part of the equation when it comes to innovating, Ito says. One reason journalists have difficulty with experimentation, at least within their job, is that it could mean losing everything. Because of the nature of the industry, journalists have become “people who have been trained to be so good at what they do that the cost of not doing it is very high,” Ito said. That, in turn, brings up another problem: the skills. Journalists, while skilled and trained in writing and editing, may be less prepared to build a new product or devise a new business model as a designer or developer, Ito said. 
As anyone watching media companies today knows, there are problems on the institutional level that can limit the impact of individual reporters, editors, or developers. Media companies are facing a fundamental decision that will shape their future, Ito said. “When you’re sinking, you have two ways to go: You can bet the house on something, go all in, or you can try to become smaller and smaller until you disappear,” he said. TWEET
Some of the bets we see now are things like paywalls, or investing money in intensely local markets to try to build up community coverage and re-establish a connection with readers, Zuckerman said. That’s what we see with investors like Warren Buffett buying up small and midsized papers, or Aaron Kushner’s reinvention-in-progress of the Orange County Register. But that still leaves a lot of journalists trying to find ways to transform their paper from within, without the benefit of a cash-rich new owner, Zuckerman said.
Ito said one solution is people with ideas working in small teams, and on some occasions skirting the official channels until an idea, app, or other product is more fully formed. Innovation doesn’t always need to come from the edges, but it often grows well there. “I do think that — and this is generally true about innovating in large organizations — it’s a small number of people who understand enough about what needs to be done and go off and just do it,” Ito said. 
Zuckerman wondered if acquisitions, a method favored in the tech world, is the answer for media companies. Companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google regularly buy or raid smaller companies with the talent or technology they need. But by and large, that doesn’t happen in media, in part becuase media companies lack the cash or high-flying stock values needed. Media companies could also be hard pressed to integrate managers from an outside company fully into a newspaper’s leadership team. In the world of tech companies, those outsiders can rise to the top of their new firm — but in a newspaper? “You don’t get to be the editor-in-chief of The Boston Globe by starting Homicide Watch,” Zuckerman said.
While there is plenty the world of media could learn from Silicon Valley and other parts of the tech world, Ito said a purely financial orientation should not be one of them. Tech companies can be relentless in their pursuit of profits, but newspapers and other media organizations, have a mission beyond money, he said. The concept of a double bottom line — meeting the civic needs of readers as well as the fiscal ones of investors — needs to remain important to media companies, even in times of shallow growth and slim profits, Ito said.

Wow, where to begin?
It is nice to say that newspapers have “a double bottom line”, but unless the editor is also the owner, that’s pretty naive.  Unlike in tech, where investors may put money in a portfolio of startups hoping that one in ten (or twenty or one hundred) makes it, you’ll find that the investors in media properties tend to make one big bet, and they only see one bottom line.  Public companies are also challenged to hit hit their revenue and profit numbers each quarter.  That may be good … it may be bad … but that’s the way it is.  That’s the environment that management is working in.
As far as product development goes, perhaps the editors are not the people who should be the innovators, exactly because of the skill set.  In other industries, CPG for instance, there is a rigorous methodology for product development.  Is there a market?  How big is the market?  Who are the competitors?  Can we make money (yes, that is a consideration)?
Seems like the folks at Blackberry (and Motorola?) had the same constraints as people in media.  Maybe it’s just easier to innovate when you are not the industry under attack.

Dealing with email and my partial attention problem during meetings »


Joi
Mar 11, 2017 - 18:35 UTC »

Gadgets -  Mindfulness







I currently have to deal with five hours or so of email a day and each day is packed with meetings, many as short as 15 minutes and 1 hour meetings being booked only in extraordinary circumstances. I have a list of 100 or so names of people that I've promised to meet, many who are very angry because we haven't been able to even book a meeting on my calendar.
I aggressively turn down all kinds of request and am aggressively resigning from boards and other obligations, but each day, I receive a steady flow of meeting requests that I just can't turn down.
I've chosen this path and I'm not complaining about the fact that I'm busy.
My concern at the moment is that the urgency and the rate of inbound email requires that in addition to the 2-3 hours of email in the morning and the 2-3 hours of email in the evening, I must diligently triage email during the day. Right now, depending on how much of my attention is required in a meeting, I keep an eye on my email and direct partial attention to my device and not my meeting. As someone who (ironically) co-teaches a class on awareness, I realize that this is both rude and a very poor way to have an effective meeting. People who know me well have gotten used to it, but for many people, it's disconcerting and disappointing.
I've thought about what I can do about this. The obvious answer is to try to check email between meetings, but that would mean that I would have to reduce the number of meetings since my meetings are so short. I could also ignore more of my email. I'm already unable to respond to many important email requests and reducing my responsiveness in email would also cause harm. At some level this is just a matter of being completely overcommitted, and I am doing my best to try to deal with that, but I was wondering if there might be some clever way to deal with the "partial attention during meetings" problem.
One idea that I had was to schedule several hours of email time during the day interspersed with "no devices / full attention" meeting times. When someone signed up for a meeting, we would ask if they needed full attention and if so, they would end up in the "full attention slot" queue or get booked a month or so out when my next "full attention slot" was available. On the other hand, if all they wanted was for me to be available to provide opinions or make decisions as part of a broader meeting or if the person didn't mind my partial attention during meetings, we could book the meeting in a "partial attention" slot which could be scheduled sooner. I would use un-booked partial attention slots to catch up on email if no one wanted such a slot.
This feels a bit too clever by half and maybe difficult to communicate to a person not familiar with my problem.
The other idea that I had was just to ask at the beginning of a meeting, "do you want this to be a laptops closed meeting or do you mind if I keep my eye on urgent email and triage?" I'm not sure if everyone would ask for my full attention or if I'd have a selection bias where only people confident enough would ask for my full attention and that those people who really needed my attention but were too polite would end up with my partial attention.
Lastly, I could just be a bit more mindful in the meetings and try to read the room better. I am generally pretty good at figuring out when the meeting requires my full attention, but as anyone who has seen someone trying to do this knows, one probably thinks they are doing this better than they actually are and in any case, it appears disrespectful to anyone who isn't used to people in this mode.
Any suggestions? Any thoughts on my crazy ideas? I know many of you will say, "You're just overcommitted. Just say 'no' to more stuff." OK. I will and I am, but I think I will still have some variant of this problem even if I'm just replying to earnest questions from students that I think deserve some sort of response.

Darren Walker and the Ford Foundation threw a book party for my new book Whiplash (Thanks!) and Megan came a bit early so I got a chance to sit down with her and do a Facebook Live. Megan is the former CTO of the United States serving under President Obama. She's an MIT grad, did her thesis work at the Media Lab, is on the corporation board of MIT and the advisory council and visiting committee of the Media Lab. She's also the one who first asked me whether I wanted to be considered for the role of the Director of the Media Lab so I owe a lot to her. I've known Megan for a long time and it was great catching up.
We talked about tech, digital government, inclusion and the opportunities ahead.

 I recently co-taught a class that merged content, students and a TA from MIT with a course that Jonathan Zittrain has been teaching for many years called Internet and Society, the Politics and Technologies of control. In addition, there was a program that ran together with it called the Berkman Assembly. It was a really great program and I hope we can do something similar again. There's an article about it on the Harvard Law site. Just as the Executive Order from the Trump Administration calling for a travel ban from seven Muslim countries was playing out, I was...

John Brockman's EDGE asks a tough question every year. For 2017 the question was "What scientific term or concept ought to be more widely know?" My answer was: Neurodiversity Humans have diversity in neurological conditions. While some, such as autism are considered disabilities, many argue that they are the result of normal variations in the human genome. The neurodiversity movement is an international civil rights movement that argues that autism shouldn't be "cured" and that it is an authentic form of human diversity that should be protected. In the early 1900s eugenics and the sterilization of people considered genetically inferior...

 I first met Virginia in 2015 when she and I were on a panel with Fareed Zarkaria at the Connecticut Forum. Late last year, she and Panio from Heleo reached out to see if I'd join Virginia in a conversation over Skype. Heleo "curates compelling, candid conversations between writers and thinkers about their work, research, and interests." You can see their great summary of the conversation on their website. After the conversation, I asked if I could repackage the audio as a Podcast which you can find on iTunes and SoundCloud. Virginia and I had recently gotten each other's...

Activism -  MIT Media Lab -  US Policy and Politics -  Whiplash



 I recently had a Facebook Live conversation with Shaka Senghor, a Media Lab Director's Fellow and author. Shaka spent 19 years in prison for second-degree murder. In prison Shaka found a path to redemption initially through reading and then writing. I met him just after he had come out of prison. You can read more about this in the foreword to his book that I wrote. Shaka's an amazing leader, writer, inspiration and an important voice behind the fight against the systematic mass incarceration in the US. We talk about prison, his book, Writing My Wrongs and a bit...

Joi Ito’s nine principles for success in a time of change


Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInPinterestGoogleMoreRedditTumblrPress ThisEmail 
Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, is an inspirational figure in the worlds of tech and design. Ito was an early investor behind Flickr and Twitter, and he has played a role in many other tech startups and nonprofit initiatives. He dropped out of college twice, but his personal vision has attracted the attention of some of the best minds around the world.
A notable crowd was in attendance to hear Ito’s keynote launch of the four day forum IDEAS CITY, on May 1st. Ito is the kind of thinker people look to in times of rapid change, and Cooper Union’s historic Great Hall, built in the mid-19th century, provided a resonant setting for a talk about the future.
‘From BI to AI’
After sharing a joke with the audience, Joi neatly dove into his theme: the untapped capital of the internet. He pointed out that the world has evolved from ‘BI to AI’ — before and after internet. 
Life in BI was slow and centralized. Experts were the sources of authority, and the distribution of knowledge was from top to bottom. Prior to the internet, innovation was costly, inflexible, and time consuming. Corporations often worried about the substantial risks involved in their investments and developments. Without constant feedback, end products risked misalignment with market needs. In this environment, large corporations often felt reluctant to make new adjustments because they wanted returns on their initial investments, instead of providing optimal products, or services.
In AI, life is fast-paced, information is complex, and knowledge is disseminated from the bottom up. In Joichi’s own words, the theme of AI is “anarchic.” Rapid connectivity empowers people to share, organize, and act quickly to the degree that no single entity (governments, corporations, or individuals) can fully control the accesses to knowledge and information. In fact, open-source, or open-content formats have forced businesses to adapt bottom-up designs and provide competitive pricing. Since the capacity of information technology doubles roughly every two years (according to Moore’s law), the cost of innovation has gone down drastically. 
New World, New Attitude & New Approach
Open and low-cost innovation equals opportunities. Joichi encourages individuals to take risks and to become entrepreneurs. When I asked if that includes dropping out before finishing a degree, he clarified that he didn’t encourage students to drop out of college — but to embrace risk-taking afterwards.
However, he repeatedly emphasized the difference between theory and practice. AI, our turbulent era, is inherently fast paced and unpredictable. One cannot afford to theorize their ideas and hope for the market to follow. Entrepreneurs need to face reality by directly testing their products and services. Fail, learn, and then adjust accordingly.
“Agility” and “resilience” are critical traits. Google did not have a business plan at the early stages of the company’s development because it did not know where the business model for search was, until the service evolved. YouTube, which originally integrated a dating site with a self-made video platform in 2005, failed miserably at its early launches. The founders cried for a week, made quick adjustments of the ideas and became successful. Entrepreneurs often cannot pick the winning idea at the very first try, and they simply need to stay flexible and keep trying.
Joichi also touched on the connection between needs and services. In the business world, products and services need to address creativity and locality. He gave an example about Detroit; local residents do not welcome corporations, who romanticize the region, making big changes without engaging the communities. Applying the same concept to governance, a group of concerned individuals, who did not have any disaster experience prior to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, did better jobs than the Japanese government. They achieved success by driving a car around to collect radiation data and provide constructive assistance to the victims. 
Future Opportunity
3D printing is the next big thing. 3D printing encourages customization and creative expression; it will manifest the trend of “self-learning” in the information age. With 3D printing, hardware startups can act similarly to Internet startups; the ability to fabricate designs on site will permit low production and innovation costs while allowing a high level of creative customization.
For Ito, the bottom line of the future is: Think big, write your own rules, design your own things and print your own stuff.
9 Principles:
Let’s summarize Joichi’s wisdom with his 9 principles:
Disobedience over compliance: Learn the system and find ways to innovate beyond it.
Emerge over authority: Do not let the authority or norms to limit your potential and creativity.
Practice over theory: Build first, theory later; build prototypes first, draft business plans later.
Resilience over strength: Test and fail quickly to understand the market, then make new adjustments accordingly.
Risk over safety: Do not let over-protection take away your learning opportunities.
Pull over push: Start your project first, and then pull resources together while you need; do not plan for everything at the beginning.
Compass over map: Be creative; draw your own maps.
Embrace serendipity: Embrace unexpected changes and events; read more about the 3M’s Post-It Notes story.
Pattern recognition: Keep your vision and thinking open and flexible; laser focus may kill innovation at the development stages.
__
Ito provided a jolt of enthusiasm to the launch of the four day IDEAS CITY event; subsequent panels (as covered in City Atlas, including panels on Waste, Play, and Youth) each detailed the challenges the future brings. One hopes the ingenuity of the AI world, so brightly described by Joi Ito, can be a model for solutions across all aspects of the urban future: that takes determination too, as described by the writer Bruce Sterling in a recent talk in Berlin. Sterling’s very hard question begins at about 6:20.
