About AMG 


AMG OverviewPhilosophyHistoryClientsProductsAMG FundsAMG Wealth PartnersAffiliatesManagement Team





Back to AMG AffiliatesArtemis Investment Management LLPInvestment DisciplineArtemis believes 
that, whatever markets are doing, opportunities for above-average returns are 
available for active managers. The firm’s fund managers are 
collegiate, communicative and always keen to discuss and exchange investment 
ideas. Drawing on each other's experience and knowledge, sharing ideas and 
insights between teams, specialist units operate with support from the wider 
business towards a common goal. Artemis tries to keep bureaucracy to a minimum, 
allowing its managers to concentrate on what they do best – selecting the right 
stocks or bonds for clients within a clear framework of risk management. The 
firm’s managers have the freedom to invest without the constraints of a single 
house style or process.  The result is ‘high conviction’ portfolios that 
frequently have a ‘look and feel’ which is markedly different from those of 
competitors and the relevant benchmark. Artemis’ sole objective as an investor 
is to outperform the market and produce superior, long-term returns for its 
clients.The FirmArtemis was founded in 1997. 
Its aim was, and still is, exemplary investment performance and client service. 
All Artemis’ staff share these two precepts – and the same flair and enthusiasm 
for fund management.The firm now manages a range of retail funds, 
investment trusts, hedge funds and both pooled and segregated institutional 
portfolios.Artemis’ fund managers all invest in the funds that they 
and their colleagues manage. This has been a key tenet of Artemis’ approach to 
investment since the firm started. It means that the interests of Artemis’ fund 
managers are aligned directly with those of the firm’s 
clients.Contact InformationCassini House 57 St James's

History[edit]
Artemis was founded in 1997. In 2002 a majority stake was acquired by ABN AMRO;[2] that stake subsequently passed to Fortis.[3] Following a management buyout in 2010, Artemis is owned by Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) and the Artemis partners.[4] This is a financial partnership: AMG does not get involved in the day-to-day running of the business.
Artemis is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) [5] and currently has 28 partners, comprising fund managers and other key individuals at the firm. The four founders, Mark Tyndall, John Dodd, Derek Stuart and Lindsay Whitelaw, have always recognised that one of the key determinants in long-term success is the stability of the investment team.
Operations[edit]
Although many financial services companies sell insurance or banking products,[6] Artemis is dedicated to asset management. The firm’s clients include retail investors, financial advisers, and large institutional investors such as pension funds and financial institutions.[7] The firm has offices in Edinburgh and London and, as at 30 June 2017, it managed £25.6 billion of assets.[8]
Headquarters[edit]
The firm’s offices are at 42 Melville Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7HA and Cassini House, 57 St James's Street, London SW1A 1LD.

Artemis
Main Partner






Artemis Investment Management LLP
Artemis is a leading UK-based fund manager, offering a range of funds which invest in the UK, Europe, the US and around the world.
As a dedicated, active investment house, we specialise in investment management for both retail and institutional investors across Europe.
Independent and owner-managed, Artemis opened for business in 1997. Its aim was, and still is, exemplary investment performance and client service. All Artemis’ staff share these two precepts – and the same flair and enthusiasm for fund management.
The firm now manages some £23.2 billion* across a range of funds, two investment trusts, a venture capital trust and both pooled and segregated institutional portfolios.
Our managers invest in their own and their colleagues’ funds. This has been a basic tenet of the Artemis approach since the firm started. It means that interests of our fund managers are directly aligned with those of our investors. 
How we relate to the world beyond fund management is also part of the distinctive Artemis culture. Each year the firm gives a fixed proportion of revenues to the Artemis Charitable Foundation. Our staff and the trustees choose which charities will benefit from that income. We encourage all employees to get involved directly too, through a wide variety of activities: from painting a child’s bedroom or mentoring a teenager, to extreme races in the UK and abroad. For example, our annual Artemis Great Kindrochit Quadrathlon was another success in 2014, raising over £200,000 for good causes. Meanwhile, Artemis has long had a policy of matching personal charitable donations by partners and staff.
 “It takes skill, knowledge, passion, persistence and dedicated teamwork to compete with the best in the world of offshore ocean racing. The entire Artemis Ocean Racing campaign reflects Artemis Investment Management LLP’s core values and philosophy. Our success is dependent on planning the best course through uncharted territory and hunting down profits for our diverse client base.” Mark Tyndall, senior partner and a founder member, Artemis Investment Management LLP.

With stocks of 7.5 million bottles representing some five years’ supply, Pol Roger remains one of the smaller of the great Champagne houses and uncompromising in its refusal to release wines until they are fully mature.
Pol Roger is the champagne of choice by the Artemis Offshore Academy team and as it happens, Sir Winston Churchill.

Elliot Brown
Official Timekeeper










Years of extreme sports experience and a desire to build the worlds toughest watches was the catalyst for Elliot and Brown to follow their hearts and create a range of watches like no other.  Handsome enough to covet, tough enough to withstand the harshest environment yet affordable enough to wear every day.
It’s not revolution, more evolution with every component, every detail refined, strengthened and honed. It’s not hard to see why they’ve won multiple awards and are fast becoming the mariner’s go-to choice. Designed to take the sort of punishment our endurance sailors dish out every day, yet look smart with a best shirt in the evening.

Support the Academy 






Since 2010 the Academy has been committed to supporting the future of British single-handed sailing. Training and racing on a fleet of strict one design Figaro yachts, each year a squad of promising young sailors are put through the paces. From weather planning, navigation, nutrition and boat maintenance to understanding the wider world of sponsorship and corporate support of sailing, the Academy creates a rounded and extensive training programme.  
The aim for the sailors is to gain knowledge and skill and then ultimately take part in La Solitaire Bompard Le Figaro, the most credible stepping stone for those heading for the elite stage of solo sailing, the Vendee Globe. La Solitaire is staged over 1500 miles of Europe’s toughest waters, a challenging race that tests the abilities of the most experienced of transoceanic sailors. A British sailor is yet to win the prestigious race however with the full and comprehensive Academy training programme, built by industry experts and supported by world class sailors, we hope for that to change.

History[edit]
Artemis was founded in 1997. In 2002 a majority stake was acquired by ABN AMRO;[2] that stake subsequently passed to Fortis.[3] Following a management buyout in 2010, Artemis is owned by Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) and the Artemis partners.[4] This is a financial partnership: AMG does not get involved in the day-to-day running of the business.
Artemis is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) [5] and currently has 28 partners, comprising fund managers and other key individuals at the firm. The four founders, Mark Tyndall, John Dodd, Derek Stuart and Lindsay Whitelaw, have always recognised that one of the key determinants in long-term success is the stability of the investment team.
Operations[edit]
Although many financial services companies sell insurance or banking products,[6] Artemis is dedicated to asset management. The firm’s clients include retail investors, financial advisers, and large institutional investors such as pension funds and financial institutions.[7] The firm has offices in Edinburgh and London and, as at 30 June 2017, it managed £25.6 billion of assets.[8]
Headquarters[edit]
The firm’s offices are at 42 Melville Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7HA and Cassini House, 57 St James's Street, London SW1A 1LD.

History[edit]
Artemis was founded in 1997. In 2002 a majority stake was acquired by ABN AMRO;[2] that stake subsequently passed to Fortis.[3] Following a management buyout in 2010, Artemis is owned by Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) and the Artemis partners.[4] This is a financial partnership: AMG does not get involved in the day-to-day running of the business.
Artemis is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) [5] and currently has 28 partners, comprising fund managers and other key individuals at the firm. The four founders, Mark Tyndall, John Dodd, Derek Stuart and Lindsay Whitelaw, have always recognised that one of the key determinants in long-term success is the stability of the investment team.
Operations[edit]
Although many financial services companies sell insurance or banking products,[6] Artemis is dedicated to asset management. The firm’s clients include retail investors, financial advisers, and large institutional investors such as pension funds and financial institutions.[7] The firm has offices in Edinburgh and London and, as at 30 June 2017, it managed £25.6 billion of assets.[8]
Headquarters[edit]
The firm’s offices are at 42 Melville Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7HA and Cassini House, 57 St James's Street, London SW1A 1LD.
