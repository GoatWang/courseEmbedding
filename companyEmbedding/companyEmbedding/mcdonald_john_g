John has practiced exclusively on the management side of labor and employment
matters for more than 20 years. He regularly represents clients in employee
mobility matters including counseling and litigating over non-compete,
non-solicit and trade secret issues. John has also represented employers in a
wide range of employment litigation matters in federal and state courts, as well
as before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and U.S., and various
State Departments of Labor. He has also represented employers in arbitrations
before the American Arbitration Association and FINRA. John has represented
employers in union counter-campaigns and in unfair labor practice trials before
the National Labor Relations Board. 
John regularly counsels corporate clients on a wide range of employment
topics, including compliance with federal and state anti-discrimination laws,
investigating and responding to charges of discrimination or harassment, wage
and hour compliance issues, addressing employee mobility issues and protecting
corporate assets through the use of non-competition, non-solicitation and
confidentiality agreements, employee discipline and discharge issues, and union
avoidance strategies. He has also assisted clients in the preparation of
employment agreements, policies and handbooks, public accommodation compliance
issues and management training.
John has also advised corporate clients on brick and mortar and web
accessibility compliance issues under Title III of the ADA, and has defended
clients in actions brought by governmental agencies.
While in law school, John served as the Editor-in-Chief for the Syracuse
Law Review.
