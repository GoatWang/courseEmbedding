This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

	Q4 total revenue was approximately $2.9 million which was at the mid-point of the guidance range given on the Q3 2016 earnings call on November 2, 2016. This revenue comprised approximately $1.6 million of new product revenue and $1.3 million of mature product revenue. The Company ended the fourth quarter with a higher than anticipated cash balance of approximately $14.9 million. These preliminary financial results are subject to completion of the Company's customary annual closing, and audit procedures.









	"I'm very pleased with the strategic progress we made during the fourth quarter and the accelerated momentum we gathered during the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this past week," said Brian Faith, QuickLogic President & CEO.  "Given this progress and the momentum, I believe we are on track to realize the strategic objectives we've previously outlined for 2017.  I look forward to discussing our recent accomplishments in more detail during our presentation at the 19th Annual Needham Growth Conference in New York this week."









	The Company expects to release its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results at approximately 1:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time / 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 15, 2017. The dial-in number for the live audio call is (877) 377-7094 or you can access it online at

	This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business expectations, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: delays in the market acceptance of the Company’s new products; the ability to convert design opportunities into customer revenue; our ability to replace revenue from end-of-life products; the level and timing of customer design activity; the market acceptance of our customers’ products; the risk that new orders may not result in future revenue; our ability to introduce and produce new products based on advanced wafer technology on a timely basis; our ability to adequately market the

	low power, competitive pricing and short time-to-market of our new products; intense competition, including the introduction of new products by competitors; our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel; changes in product demand or supply; capacity constraints; and general economic conditions. These and other potential factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are described in more detail in the Company’s public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including the risks discussed in the “Risk Factors” section in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in the Company’s prior press releases, which are available on the Company's Investor Relations website at


	http://ir.quicklogic.com/


	 and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is January 10, 2017, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.

The specified minerals referred to as “Conflict Minerals” are gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolfamite, including their derivatives which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten. The “Covered Countries” for purposes of the Rule and our Report are the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola.We develop and market low power customizable semiconductor solutions that enable Original Equipment Manufacturers to maximize battery life for highly differentiated, immersive user experiences with Smartphone, Wearable, Tablet and Internet-of-Things devices. We deliver these benefits through industry leading ultra-low power customer programmable System on Chip semiconductor solutions, embedded software, and algorithm solutions for always-on voice and sensor processing, and enhanced visual experiences. We are a fabless semiconductor company that provides comprehensive, flexible sensor processing solutions, ultra-low power display bridges, and ultra-low power Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs. As a semiconductor company, we have concluded that Conflict Minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our products.Our products are manufactured by our industry recognized suppliers in accordance with our specifications.

Responses were reviewed for completeness, reasonableness and consistency, and we routinely followed up for any corrections and clarifications. During 2016, we contracted with Source 44 LLC dba Source Intelligence, a third party vendor to coordinate the efforts of receiving and analyzing the CMRTs. Through Source Intelligence’s database we received detailed information regarding the smelters/refiners and associated mine countries reported in our supply chain.We submitted this template to nine (9) tier 1 suppliers, which represent 100% of the Company's top tier suppliers for 2016. Of these responding suppliers, 67% indicated one or more of the Conflict Minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of the products supplied.Conflict Minerals DisclosureThis Form SD of the Company is filed pursuant to Rule 13p-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the reporting period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.A copy of the Company’s Conflict Minerals Report is provided as Exhibit 1.01 to this Form SD, and is publicly available at http://ir.quicklogic.com/sec.cfm.Item 1.02 ExhibitAs specified in Section 2, Item 2.01 of this Form SD, the Company is hereby filing its Conflict Minerals Report as Exhibit 1.01 to this report.Section 2 – ExhibitsThe following exhibit is filed as part of this report.Item 2.01 Exhibits.Exhibit 1.01 – 2016 Conflict Minerals Report of QuickLogic Corporation as required by Items 1.01 and 1.02 of this Form.2SIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the duly authorized undersigned.    Date: May 18, 2017 QuickLogic Corporation    /s/ Suping (Sue) Cheung     Suping (Sue) CheungChief Financial Officer 3EXHIBIT INDEX    ExhibitNo.  Description  1.01  2016 Conflict Minerals Report of QuickLogic Corporation as required by Items 1.01 and 1.02 of this Form.4
