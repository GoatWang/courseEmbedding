History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]

History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]

ABERDEEN, Scotland and NEW YORK, Oct. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Riverstone Holdings LLC ("Riverstone"), a leading energy and power-focused private equity firm, and Proserv Group Inc ("Proserv"), based in Aberdeen, Scotland, announced today the signing of a definitive agreement pursuant to which Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund V, L.P., in partnership with Proserv management, has agreed to acquire 100% of the shares of Proserv from investment funds affiliated with Intervale Capital ("Intervale"), Weatherford International ("Weatherford") and certain minority shareholders. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and is expected to close by December.
Formed by Intervale through the acquisition and integration of several specialty subsea services businesses between 2008 and 2014, Proserv is a high-quality global engineered products and services business, with offshore and subsea solutions covering drilling control systems, subsea production systems, production equipment and systems and marine technology services across the full life-of-field, with particular emphasis on brownfield upgrade and life extension. The company is diversified by business division, between manufacturing and services, and by geography, with operations across North and South America, Europe, West Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. For more information, please visit www.proserv.com.
David Lamont, CEO of Proserv, commented, "We are excited to partner with Riverstone, whose management team clearly understands the trends driving Proserv's end markets, and the unique value proposition we bring to our customers. I'd also like to thank Intervale and Weatherford for fully supporting our business over the past few years, and for helping us select Riverstone as the ideal partner for the next phase of our development." Mr. Lamont will continue as CEO of Proserv following the closing of the transaction.
John Lancaster, a Partner at Riverstone, added, "This investment is consistent with Riverstone's strategy of partnering with leading manufacturing and service companies that participate in technically demanding and service-intensive oil and gas operations globally.  Proserv is a strong and emerging player in global offshore subsea services and equipment, where we believe capital spending and activity levels will grow over the long-term as companies like Proserv provide increasingly innovative, cost-effective solutions to offshore oil and gas producers.  We look forward to working with David and his team to further build on the Company's success to date."

      ("Riverstone"), announced today an agreement to join with the management 
      of Hudson Products Corporation (“Hudson” 
      or the “Company”) to 
      purchase 100 percent of the outstanding stock in Hudson from The

      producing high quality products. We look forward to continuing the 
      Company’s growth and maintaining its 
      reputation as a leading provider of heat exchange solutions.”


      The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including 
      antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]
