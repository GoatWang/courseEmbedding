Reviews  Donnelly is a poet everyone should read.—David Wheatley, The Guardian  If Whitman had had a young kid and a Brooklyn apartment, too many bills, and stack of takeout menus in the top drawer of his Ikea desk, he would have written these poems...—Dan Chiasson, The New Yorker  [The Cloud Corporation] is an extraordinary collection—the poetry of the future, here, today.—John Ashbery, The London Times  Dramatic tension, humor, lyrical profundity. This is an utterly ingenious and proudly inclusive voice, incorporating clouds—you cannot turn away from it...—Carol Muske-Dukes, Huffington Post  Timothy Donnelly meditates on the very terms that make meditation possible—terms such as “knowledge,” “mystery,” “particular,” “mind,” and “will”...and he makes the tough time we have pinning those terms down into one of his typical subjects. His kind of pessimistic introspection, cast in long sentences and in three-line stanzas, might remind you of late Wallace Stevens...—Stephen Burt, Coldfront  Timothy Donnelly is a talented writer...an astonishing technician...—David Orr, Poetry  Reviews of books by Timothy Donnelly  The Cloud Corporation

In a famous video clip from Penn and Teller's Showtime hidden camera show, diners are lured to an upscale restaurant branded as the world's first boutique vendor of bottled water. A water steward presents each table with a menu discussing the finer qualities of water purportedly shipped in from mountains and streams all over the world, some of which cost as much as $8 a bottle.
Of course, the joke is on the customers because all the water actually came from the garden hose out back, but the message was clear: People are willing to pay more for a product if they think it gives them a truly special or significant value—and if you present it to them in just the right way.
Your company is probably selling a stuff that's a lot more valuable than fancied-up hose water. Selling on value, not price, involves a balance of confidence, personal rapport, and doing your homework, and it's become more difficult as technology gives consumers greater access to price information and competitors. We've talked with veterans of selling their value, and they share some tips on how to make your products stand out in a low-cost world.
Choose Your Targets Wisely
New companies often make one fatal mistake that forces them to compromise on price, says Barry Farber, a business consultant who has worked with American Airlines, AT&T and BMW, and author of more than 11 books on sales. Companies don't narrow their target market, and don't understand their products likely aren't for everyone.
Farber says to do this by researching the potential client to see if they are a good candidate to meet your price needs. This saves you from wasting time talking to people who only want the cheapest deal.
"Some sales people, they just make sure the prospect is breathing and then they dump all this info on them," he says. "That's not a good return on your investment of your time. Sales reps that don't have that kind of aggressive focus, if they lose [the deal], their month is dead, their year is dead."
Nat Kausik, CEO of Trubates, an online marketplace for adjustable local deals, says his company knows that many consumers are familiar with the nature of value-based pricing, especially after dealing with fluctuating airplane fares. The right customers will be receptive to hearing why they should pay more for a certain product over another: That's why his site lets users review an offer after they redeem it, and makes the review available to other users.
"Consumers, they're very sophisticated," he says. "They understand how to explore price for value."
About one-third of consumers are purely hung up on price, while the other two-thirds are open to at least hearing your argument, says Tom Reilly, an author and value-based shopping expert. Innovators and early adopters are more likely to shell out the extra money, he says.
"Be crystal clear whom the market segment is that you're designing for," he says.
Dig Deeper: How to Narrow Your Target Market
Leverage Your Strengths and Experience
Once you're in the sales meeting with a potential client, you had better be ready to stiffen your backbone and wield the full weight of your company's strengths. This comes largely from sales skills, but you can prepare your team by educating them on how your company stands out.
 "It's almost embarrassing at times the way people don't understand all the ways they bring value," Reilly says.
You should also be telling the potential client or customers about the history of the company, which helps build confidence in the product. Build up your success stories by documenting testimonials from past successes and showing them off to future opportunities.
"Be able to successfully use your customers as your sales people," Farber says.
Orwak, a company that supplies waste compactors, baling systems, and other recycling equipment, emphasizes its value thanks to its trans-continental reach. Based in Europe, the company has seen recycling grow leaps and bounds ahead of the United States over the past 40 years. Its sales team pitches its products as a way to help companies stay ahead of the recycling curve.
"We try to sell it as, 'Hey we've been there, done that. Let's look at Europe, that's the future of America,'" says Mark Lanning, Orwak's national sales manager. "We're going to give you a little peek at the future from our experience."
Dig Deeper: Secrets to Getting Good Reviews Online
Know That Confidence is Key
When you're highlighting the value of a product over cheaper competitors, you shouldn't be vacillating on price or negotiating. Reilly says to avoid words and phrases that suggest flexibility, things like saying "generally, we charge" or "your price."
"The time not to show a lack of conviction is when you're asking people for money," he says.
Drop the price without hesitation and without getting defensive, he says.
It is the time, however, to mention the advantages you bring to market: global sourcing, logistic support programs and other things that go beyond the features of a single product or service, Reilly says.
You can be confident without dragging your competitors through the dirt, Farber says. Highlight why your product's value is worth their consideration over lower-price options.
"The most critical thing an entrepreneur needs more than anything else is confidence," he says. "If that's missing, I don't care if you have a plan and all that stuff, you're dead in the water. You can lose your edge right away, and selling value becomes 10 times more difficult."
Dig Deeper: How to Boost Confidence and Success
Emphasize Your Customer Service
The toughest job selling value to customers is getting them to picture the full depth and breadth of everything your company has to offer.
Lanning says his company likes to talk about more than just the product, as comparing balers can feel like just comparing one hunk of steel to another. Customers now expect a quick response time, an ease of use and the feeling that you care about them.
"It's easier to paint the picture about service than a hard object," he says.
Farber advises people to foucs on personal touches and developing a rapport with the client by getting to know their needs and business background.
"I'm a big believer of handwritten thank you notes," he says.
Often the customers who are obsessed with finding the lowest price turn into the biggest headaches, he says. But the customers that see your value understand you'll be there to provide customer service.
Make sure to keep providing good service throughout the lifespan of the customer, which will let you pile up those customer testimonials you can use to show future clients why you provide the right value.
"Value is always long term," Reilly says. "Price is short term."

DHA Names New DHMSM Product Manager - Tim Donnelly
Posted March 31, 2016  4:00am  (Last updated July 21, 2017  8:24pm)






G2X
TAKE: Leveraging the past 5 years of
experience with the Navy as an APM for Acquisition and Business Ops and, prior
to that, as APM with “oversight, management and delivery of all IT services for
the world's largest intranet made up of over 500,000 Navy users and 308,000 computers”, Tim Donnelly now takes over as a new DoD Health
Management System Modernization (DHMSM) Product Manager.While Tim
is likely to be a fairly new face to many who support DHA, he spent more than a
dozen years on the industry side of the house and I am sure there will be more
than a few familiar faces who are happy to reintroduce themselves over the new
few weeks.

Columbia’s Timothy Donnelly Receives $100,000
Written by Bwog Staff
 February 08, 20128:31 pm 5 Comments



Timothy Donnelly
Last week, Columbia associate professor Timothy Donnelly won the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, one of the most prestigious prizes awarded to contemporary poets. Not only does the award identify Donnelly as a rising star in the world of contemporary poetry, but also bestows him with $100,000, an enormous sum for a mid-career poet in today’s market. Donnelly comments,”this prize will give my family and me a measure of financial stability that would otherwise have taken a decade or more to achieve.” The award recognizes his most recent work, The Cloud Corporation, for which The New Yorker somewhat obliquely called Donnelly “an acrobatic formalist, albeit one on fast-forward.” This semester, Donnelly teaches a senior poetry workshop for undergraduates and a poetry thesis workshop School of the Arts.
Full press release after the jump…

Columbia University School of the Arts 
Writing Faculty Timothy Donnelly 
Receives Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award
 
New York, February 2, 2012—Columbia University School of the Arts is pleased to announce that Timothy Donnelly, Associate Professor of Writing, has won the $100,000 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award for his book The Cloud Corporation (Wave, Picador). The annual award, offered through the Claremont Graduate University, is one of the most prestigious prizes a contemporary poet can receive.
“I am thrilled that Timothy Donnelly has won the Kingsley Tufts Award,” said Carol Becker, Dean of School of the Arts. “Not only is Timothy a beloved professor, who has made monumental contributions to our Writing Program, but, as many have expressed, he is one of the great poets of his generation.”
For 20 years now, the Kingsley Tufts Award has supported and honored mid-career poets, including previous recipients D.A. Powell, Henri Cole, Matthea Harvey and Yusef Komunyakaa.
“I’m among the many people in this country who have had to go into significant debt just to get by,” Donnelly said of the seven difficult and sleep-deprived years he spent writing The Cloud Corporation. All the anxiety in the book about the economy and the struggle to make ends meet isn’t just for effect—it’s all very personal. This prize will give my family and me a measure of financial stability that would otherwise have taken a decade or more to achieve. But as true as all that is, it’s the honor of having had The Cloud Corporation chosen for this distinction that I really can’t wrap my head around.”
The Cloud Corporation is Timothy Donnelly’s second book. His first, Twenty-seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit, was published by Grove Press in 2003. His poems have been widely anthologized and translated, appearing in such periodicals as A Public Space, Fence, Harper’s, The Iowa Review, jubilat, Lana Turner, The Nation, The New Republic and The Paris Review.
This spring he is the Theodore H. Holmes ’51 and Bernice Holmes Visiting Associate Professor at Princeton University’s Program in Creative Writing and Lewis Center for the Arts. He has been poetry editor of Boston Review since 1996. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two daughters.
The Kingsley Tufts Award was established by Kate Tufts to honor the memory of her husband, who worked as an executive and wrote poetry as his avocation. Kate and Kingsley Tufts were lifelong poetry lovers and often spoke of creating such a prize. The award is presented for work by a poet who is past the very beginning but has not yet reached the pinnacle of his or her career.
“We hope these awards will give a crucial injection of encouragement to the poets of America,” said Linda Gregerson, chair of the judging panel. “We expect of these poets thrilling work in the years to come.”

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
