History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2011)


Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model "A" Ford.[8] Within a few years,[when?] the business expanded to leasing trucks to other companies. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. By 1939, Ryder's truck fleet had increased to 50. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955 Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955.[13] By the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder had expanded into the distribution and supply chain markets.
James A. Ryder, founder and chairman, retired in 1978.[8]
In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing.
Business[edit]
Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. As of 2008, the total company revenue was $6.2 billion, earnings before income taxes of $459 million.
Fleet management[edit]
Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% of its revenue for a total of $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total.[14] This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent.[15] Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.
In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California.[16] Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California,[17] and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.[18]
Supply chain[edit]
Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008.[14]
In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.[19]
Dedicated Contract Carriage[edit]
Ryder Dedicated Contract Carriage accounted for 8% of its revenue for a total of $0.5 billion. Profit of $49 million was 10% of the total.[14] This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated.
Rental trucks[edit]
Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as "one-ways" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive-service locations. In June 1998, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the "one-way" business arena; which it sold to Budget Truck Rental.[20] The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.
Headquarters[edit]
Ryder's headquarters are located in an unincorporated area in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, near the Miami Dade-County, Broward County boundary line.[21][22]
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida.[23] In 2002, after taking a year-long study of 22 potential headquarters sites in South Florida, Ryder announced that it would move its headquarters to another location in northwest Miami-Dade County. The commute times of around 200 employees who reside in Broward County decreased. Before the announcement of the final headquarters site, Ryder considered some locations in Miramar in Broward County.[22] In 2005 Shoma Development Corp. began demolishing the former Ryder headquarters in Doral, replacing it with the Park Square at Doral development.[24]
Ryder also has a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS Operations.
Locations[edit]
Headquartered in Miami, Ryder has satellite locations in 48 US States and also in Mexico, Canada, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.[25]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.[26]

Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. As of 2008, the total company revenue was $6.2 billion, earnings before income taxes of $459 million.
Fleet management[edit]
Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% of its revenue for a total of $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total.[14] This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent.[15] Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.
In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California.[16] Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California,[17] and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.[18]
Supply chain[edit]
Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008.[14]
In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.[19]
Dedicated Contract Carriage[edit]
Ryder Dedicated Contract Carriage accounted for 8% of its revenue for a total of $0.5 billion. Profit of $49 million was 10% of the total.[14] This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated.
Rental trucks[edit]
Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as "one-ways" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive-service locations. In June 1998, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the "one-way" business arena; which it sold to Budget Truck Rental.[20] The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.
Headquarters[edit]
Ryder's headquarters are located in an unincorporated area in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, near the Miami Dade-County, Broward County boundary line.[21][22]
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida.[23] In 2002, after taking a year-long study of 22 potential headquarters sites in South Florida, Ryder announced that it would move its headquarters to another location in northwest Miami-Dade County. The commute times of around 200 employees who reside in Broward County decreased. Before the announcement of the final headquarters site, Ryder considered some locations in Miramar in Broward County.[22] In 2005 Shoma Development Corp. began demolishing the former Ryder headquarters in Doral, replacing it with the Park Square at Doral development.[24]
Ryder also has a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS Operations.
Locations[edit]
Headquartered in Miami, Ryder has satellite locations in 48 US States and also in Mexico, Canada, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.[25]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.[26]

Good morning and welcome to Ryder System Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines are in a listen-only mode until after the presentation. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Bob Brunn, Vice President, Corporate Strategy & Investor Relations for Ryder. Mr. Brunn, you may begin.
Robert S. Brunn - Ryder System, Inc.
Thanks very much. Good morning and welcome to Ryder's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that, during this presentation, you'll hear some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in economic, business, competitive, market, political, and regulatory factors. More detailed information about these factors is contained in this morning's earnings release and in Ryder's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to the nearest GAAP measure in the written presentation accompanying this call, which is available on our website at investors.ryder.com.
Presenting on today's call are Robert Sanchez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Art Garcia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Dennis Cooke, President of Global Fleet Management Solutions; John Diez, President of Dedicated Transportation Solutions; and Steve Sensing, President of Global Supply Chain Solutions are on the call today and available for questions following the presentation.
With that, let me turn it over to Robert.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll recap our second quarter 2017 results, review the asset management area, and discuss the current outlook for our business, then we'll open the call for questions.
With that, let's turn to an overview of our second quarter results. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.00 for the second quarter 2017, down 36% from the prior year. Second quarter 2017 comparable results exclude $0.07 of non-operating pension cost and a $0.04 gain on sale of properties disposed as part of last year's restructuring plan. Last year's comparable earnings exclude $0.09 of non-operating pension cost and $0.09 in pension-related adjustments.
Our second quarter results were above the high-end of our forecast range of $0.87 to $0.97, due to better than expected performance in our contractual lease and maintenance product lines as well as in commercial rental. Outperformance in these areas was partially offset by lower than expected results in used vehicle sales due to valuation adjustments taken to better position the fleet for future sale, and in Supply Chain due to lower than planned automotive volumes. Dedicated performance was in line with our expectations.

Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation, increased by 2% to a record $1.5 billion for the second quarter and was higher in all business segments, despite rental revenue being down by 7%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue increased by 3%. Total revenue increased by 5%, reflecting higher subcontracted transportation, driven by new business and increased operating revenue.
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the second quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter declined by 500,000 shares from the prior year of 52.9 million shares. We began repurchasing shares under the current 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter of 2016. The plan allows for the purchase of up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1 of 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. During the second quarter, we bought 607,000 shares at an average price of $68.17. Shares repurchased during the quarter amounted to approximately 1% of our float, and include the 500,000 shares from the former plan. For the program to-date, we've purchased 1.36 million shares at an average price of $70.02.
Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 37.4% for the second quarter of 2017, up 50 basis points from 36.9% in the prior year. The increase is due primarily to a greater portion of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 3% to $2.9 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.82, down 32% from last year. Return on capital was negative 10 basis points, down from a 120 basis points positive spread in the prior year, driven by lower performance in used vehicle sales and commercial rental.
I'll turn now to page 7 and discuss some key trends that we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, was just slightly up from the prior year as growth in the contractual ChoiceLease and SelectCare products was offset primarily by lower commercial rental revenue and foreign exchange. ChoiceLease revenue increased by over 2% due to fleet growth. Second quarter revenue comparisons were adversely impacted by fleet mix, foreign exchange, and high mileage activity in the prior year. We continue to expect full-year ChoiceLease revenue growth of 4%. The lease fleet, excluding U.K. trailers, decreased by 600 vehicles sequentially, but increased by 1,100 vehicles year-to-date. Adjusting for a reduction this quarter in an elevated number of vehicles being prepared for sale, which provides a more relevant comparison to our forecast, the lease fleet grew by approximately 200 vehicles sequentially and 1,400 vehicles year-to-date. We remain on track to achieve our full-year growth forecast of around 3,500 vehicles.
2017 will represent our sixth consecutive year of organic lease fleet growth. ChoiceLease continues to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as sales and marketing initiatives. So far, this year, more than 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from the prior two years. SelectCare revenue increased 3% as higher growth in SelectCare Full Service and SelectCare Preventive contract business was partially offset by flat billings for ancillary maintenance services, which is also reported in this line item. We're pleased with the fleet growth we're seeing in our SelectCare Full Service and Preventive product lines.
The fleet grew by 2,700 vehicles year-to-date, an increase by 1,300 vehicles sequentially, representing significant new customer wins. In SelectCare On-Demand, 9,800 vehicles were serviced during the quarter. This is an increase of 29% from the prior year and up 5% sequentially, driven by new business wins.

Commercial rental revenue was down 7% for the second quarter, better than the 15% decline we saw in the first quarter. Global rental demand was down by 7%, although tractor demand was modestly better than expected. Global pricing was up 1% for the quarter.
Our centralized asset management team executed effectively on our plan to reduce the rental fleet by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and making vehicles available for sale. The average rental fleet decreased 6% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down by 3%, or 1,300 vehicles, year-over-year, while it was up slightly sequentially as we enter the seasonally stronger demand period. As a result of these fleet right-sizing actions as well as modestly better than expected rental demand, utilization on power units was 75.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, representing significantly improved utilization comparisons versus the first quarter. Vehicles redeployed into other applications were up by 3% year-to-date. Redeployment activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow.
Lease extensions increased by approximately 1,200 vehicles, or 35% year-to-date, primarily reflecting activity with a large customer on a fleet of trailers. Used vehicle results for the quarter were down year over year due to a weak used vehicle environment and higher valuation adjustments. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes.
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher ChoiceLease and SelectCare results. Accelerated depreciation of $8 million and higher maintenance cost on certain older model year vehicles also negatively impacted results. Earnings before tax in FMS decreased 39%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 6.8%, down 440 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation on page 8. Total DTS segment revenue grew 6% while operating revenue was up by 3% this quarter, in-line with our initial full-year forecast, reflecting new business. We're seeing stronger growth this year with Dedicated services provided as part of multiservice solutions, which is reported in our Supply Chain segment.
Dedicated operating revenue within our reported Supply Chain segment grew by 5% for the second quarter and 9% year-to-date. Our sales team remains focused on upselling our current lease customers to Dedicated. Additionally, we continue to target prospects who are new to outsourcing, which has recently represented about half of this segment's growth.
Earnings in the Dedicated segment decreased 10%, primarily due to higher maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles and higher insurance premiums reflecting insurance market conditions. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.4%, down 110 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on page 9. Total revenue grew by 17% and operating revenue grew by 8% due to new business, increased volumes, and higher pricing. Supply Chain earnings before taxes, however, were down 9%, primarily due to the startup phase of certain new accounts. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.2% for the quarter, down 140 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending.
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Thanks, Robert. Turning to page 10, year-to-date gross capital expenditures totaled over $900 million, down around $80 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in the lease fleet, partially offset by higher planned investments to refresh the rental fleet. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue earning equipment of $206 million, down $46 million from the prior year. The decrease reflects lower sales pricing and volumes.

Net capital expenditures decreased by $36 million to $727 million. Full-year 2017 gross capital expenditures are now expected to be down by $100 million from our initial forecast. This primarily reflects a greater use of used equipment to fulfill new lease contracts.
Turning to the next page, we generated cash from operating activities of $732 million year-to-date, down 4%. The decrease was driven primarily by increased working capital requirements, partially offset by lower pension contributions. We generated $971 million of total cash year-to-date, down $88 million from the prior year.
Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by around $270 million to $855 million year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was positive $115 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $61 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures. We are maintaining our full-year 2017 forecast for free cash flow of positive $250 million, as lower operating cash flow is offset by lower capital expenditures.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.4 billion is basically flat with year-end 2016. Debt-to-equity at the end of the second quarter decreased to 256% from 263% at the end of 2016. The company has a long-term debt-to-equity target which is focused on achieving a competitive cost of capital, while maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. The target range is periodically reviewed, based on a combination of factors. Based on our most recent review, we've revised the target range from 225% to 275% to a range of 250% to 300%. This revised range is consistent with the longstanding historical target range that was in place prior to mid-2013.
Our forecast for balance sheet leverage at year-end remains unchanged at 240%, which would place us somewhat below the revised target range. Equity at the end of the quarter was just over $2.1 billion, up $54 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to earnings and foreign exchange, partially offset by share repurchase and dividends.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Thanks, Art. Page 14 summarizes key results in our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 7,500 vehicles at quarter-end. This excludes the elevated number of vehicles being prepared for sale that I mentioned earlier. A more relevant comparison, which includes these vehicles, would result in used vehicle inventory of approximately 8,400 units, down 700 vehicles year over year and unchanged sequentially. We sold 4,300 used vehicles during the quarter, down 16% from the prior year and down 4% sequentially.
Proceeds per vehicles sold were down 16% for tractors and down 14% for trucks compared to a year ago. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 5% and truck pricing was down 1%. As I mentioned earlier, pricing was better than expected, especially for trucks. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used prices were down 25%.
We continue to sell a higher than normal number of vehicles through our wholesale channel, although the retail mix improved to 64% in the second quarter versus 57% in the first quarter. The higher than normal use of wholesaling this year is part of our plan to move inventory levels to the midpoint of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles by year-end, which will better position the used fleet as we go into 2018.
I'll turn now to page 16 to cover our outlook. During the second quarter, we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in used vehicle sales and rental, while growing our contractual businesses. Our contractual products, ChoiceLease, Dedicated, and Supply Chain, all generated revenue growth during the quarter and will provide the majority of the company's earnings during 2017. As these products generally represent 3 to 7-year contractual revenue streams, growing this portfolio helps to mitigate cyclical volatility from used vehicle sales and rental, and positions us well for when these transactional businesses stabilize and recover.

Our overall earnings outlook for the balance of the year remains on track with our prior expectations as a modestly better outlook for FMS is offset by a somewhat lower expected results in Supply Chain and Dedicated. In ChoiceLease, we grew the fleet by approximately 1,400 vehicles year-to-date after adjusting for an elevated number of used vehicles being prepared for sale. Considering the timing of new sales and vehicle deliveries, we remain on track to achieve our full-year lease fleet growth of around 3,500 vehicles. We're also pleased that the percentage of new leased vehicles from customers new to outsourcing is above 40%, up from the prior two years. SelectCare Full Service and Preventive are also benefiting from strong sales activity with fleet growth of 2,700 vehicles year-to-date. In rental, year-over-year utilization comparisons improved significantly as a result of somewhat better than expected rental demand and our timely actions to align the fleet size and mix with market demands.
Looking ahead, we're anticipating normal second-half seasonality for rental and expect the balance of the year performance to be in line with our prior expectations. Since we've appropriately right-sized the rental fleet for the current environment, we anticipate that utilization will remain within the target range, with flat year-over-year pricing for the second half of the year.
In used vehicle sales, the environment continues to be challenging but somewhat stabilizing with high levels of Class 8 inventory still in the market. We now expect used vehicle pricing to decline between 18% and 20% on a full-year year-over-year basis, which is slightly reduced from the prior forecast.
During the quarter, we prepared a higher than normal number of vehicles for sale and also made additional valuation adjustments in order to reflect market conditions and better position the inventory for sale. We continue to expect inventory of around 7,000 vehicles by year-end, which is at the midpoint of the long-term target range.
In Supply Chain, balance of the year results are expected to be slightly below the prior expectations, due to lower automotive volumes at select plants and higher investments in technology, particularly impacting the third quarter. As new business ramps up in the fourth quarter, Supply Chain margins will benefit and be more normalized. Dedicated is expected to see some more modest additional second-half earnings impact from higher insurance cost, reflecting insurance market conditions.
Given the higher than expected second quarter earnings and an unchanged outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our full-year comparable EPS forecast range to $4.38 to $4.58 from $4.25 to $4.55. Our third quarter comparable earnings per share forecast of $1.25 to $1.35 versus the prior year of $1.67. Third quarter forecast reflects earnings comparisons that are still down year-over-year, but improved from those in the second quarter. We anticipate positive year-over-year earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter.
The seasonality of earnings in the third and fourth quarters is somewhat different than historical comparisons, primarily due to Supply Chain earnings. In the third quarter, Supply Chain earnings will be impacted by lower auto volumes and higher IT investments, while Supply Chain earnings in the fourth quarter will benefit from the ramp-up of signed new business. In addition, used vehicle results and accelerated depreciation are also impacting quarterly results versus historical years.
On a full-year basis, although earnings are projected to be down this year as compared to two years ago, the quality of the earnings is much higher with 80% of our earnings expected to come from contractual businesses versus approximately 45% in 2015.

That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions. In order to give everyone an opportunity, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up if clarification is needed. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to get back in the queue and we'll take as many calls as we can.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions.
And we'll take our first question from Ben Hartford with Baird.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess, Robert, let's start on the Supply Chain side in the auto exposure and some of the headwinds here, 40% of that business is tied to auto. Is it – could you talk a little bit about the sources of the weakness there? Is it from any particular OEM with which you do business, or is it just broader pressure to USR (23:16), in particular? That's one. And then two, within that segment, you're somewhat under-represented in healthcare and perhaps retail. You talk about new business wins, but what is the opportunity to be able to offset some of the headwinds in auto cyclically through sales efforts on – within these other verticals going forward to kind of drive to that mid-single-digit type operating revenue target that you've talked about historically in that segment?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I – Ben, I'll tell you that we can't comment on specific accounts, but I think if you listen to what's going on in the auto industry where you're having some slowdown, certainly in certain models across a lot of the different OEMs, I think it's just consistent with that. But the offset to that is the sales that we're seeing really in Supply Chain across all verticals, I would say even including in auto with some new businesses we're picking up. So, that's why we're talking about the fourth quarter really earnings coming back stronger versus the third quarter. And also, revenue, and that's really from (24:25) some of the new growth. So, Steve, if you want to add some additional color.
J. Steven Sensing - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, Ben, I would say that if you think about the diversity, we deal with a number of OEMs and across those plants you've got a good diverse model portfolio as well. So, really, it's around a ramp-up of new volume associated in the quarter. And as you think about Q3, you've got some model year changeover, so there's a little softness there as well. So – but I think, as Robert commented, on the portfolio we're seeing good healthy pipeline across all verticals, good strong growth. So, we expect that to be pretty even across the verticals as we go into the back half.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay, good. And then switching gears on the commercial rental side, Robert, could you talk about the trends through the quarter kind of uniformly on the broader truckload side? Spot activity did firm up in June, slightly above seasonal. Want to see if that was your experience as well. What are you experiencing in July and what is the outlook in terms of rental utilization relative to expectations in the back half of the year from a demand point of view? How much of the improvement in utilization is the supply reductions that you've talked about versus perhaps some recent improvement in underlying demand. Thanks.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Ben, we did see almost, I would say, consistent with what you heard from the truckload guys, we did see improvement in the second quarter, better than what we had expected, I'd say slightly better than seasonal. So, we have some of that built into the balance of the year and we're expecting to get, as you can see, some improvement in utilization as a result of that. So we didn't quite bring the fleet down as much as we had originally expected, I think, because of we saw better than expected utilization. So, now we're looking to really see that continue through the balance of the year. So, Dennis, I don't know if you want to give more detail.

Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
I would say that February and March were tough, as we shared before, from a demand point of view and we expected it to perform seasonally after that. And, as Robert said, it performed slightly better and, as a result, we didn't de-fleet as much as we had originally planned and so we did see some strengthening in demand.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
In July, we're seeing really consistent with (26:43) Q2.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Consistent. Yeah.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Consistent with 2Q? So, above seasonal in July and then it sounded like you're expecting slightly above seasonal trends here to finish out the year, is that right?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Slightly above. Slightly.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. Okay, thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks, and good morning.
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Good morning.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Good morning, Justin.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
So, Robert, I think you mentioned in your comments that used truck sales were about 64% retail in the quarter, and I'm curious, was that number a little bit higher than what you were expecting? And as we look at the guidance going forward, what are you baking in in terms of that split between retail and wholesale in the back half of the year?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
I'll let Dennis...
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, Justin, it was basically in line with what we had forecast and, going forward, we're projecting it to be slightly below as we continue to get the amount of units in the UTC down, so, but basically in line as we were forecasting previously.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And slightly below, I'm guessing, like maybe 60% retail, 40% wholesale, something in that ballpark?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think it was a little higher than that. I think we're expecting the full-year to end right around 65%, right? About 65% for the full-year.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about -
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
I'm sorry, Justin, let me just mention one thing.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Sure.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
I think on the call I mentioned that truck pricing sequentially was down 1%. Truck pricing was actually up 1% sequentially, so I wanted to make that correction.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful to clarify. And secondly, I wanted to ask about FSL. I think you've talked historically about targeting a return of 80 to 120 basis points above your cost of capital. Just curious where that spread stands today and, going forward, do you think that target of 80 to 120 basis points is still achievable if the used truck market doesn't recover?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think we're in that range. We're not going to get – I won't get into a lot of detail, but if you look at return on capital spreads across our business, I mean, leases continue to be strong. Obviously, the challenge has been that we went from used vehicle gains of $100 million now to slightly down, so, but we really priced this business with breakeven at the end on the gain side. So, I would say that the lease pricing should still remain very competitive, even given what we've seen so far on the used truck side.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. I'll leave it at that. Appreciate the time.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Thank you, Justin.

We'll take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could help us understand just the expectations for used vehicle gains or losses in the back half of the year. Are you expecting to continue to have losses on used vehicle sales? It looks like year-to-date, the line is about a $0.50 loss, and I think the original guidance was around $0.30. So what's the expectation for gains or losses on used vehicle sales into the back half? And if you can also help us understand maybe what's in the third quarter guidance, that could be helpful.

Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, we're expecting a break-even, so I'd say flat for the balance of the year. Obviously, we had, I think it was $0.15 loss in Q2 and that was primarily driven by the valuation adjustments that we took in the second quarter. We're not forecasting to need to take those in Q3 and Q4, so that's why you're seeing that change. So I would say it's the pricing environment, similar to what we had said prior, maybe a little bit better, just because we didn't see it – we saw it firming up a little bit. But still obviously challenge is going into the second half.
Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay, that helps. And then we'll probably see this in the 10-Q, but what was the exact dollar amount of the valuation allowances this quarter?
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
For the quarter, it was $25 million, Todd. Gains of $10 million, valuation of $25 million gets you to the negative $15 million.
Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Perfect. That helps, Art. Okay, and then just for my follow-up, what is the age of the lease fleet currently? And what was it in the first quarter and what was it in the year ago, if you have that?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think Dennis has that.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah. Todd, it's 39 months and it was 39 months in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2016, it was 38 months, so it's one month older.
Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great, okay. Thanks for the help this morning and good job turning things around from 1Q.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.

We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, thanks, morning, guys. So want to stick on the used vehicle side. So since you accelerated some depreciation in the second quarter, are you raising your expectations for third and fourth quarter gains on sales? I know you just said you think they're kind of break-even. I don't know if that's a change that's better than what you were previously expecting.
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah. The net is probably up a little bit because, obviously, we did a good job in the second quarter of bringing in more units than we had anticipated. So some of those units there was a P&L impact that was in our prior guidance. So the UVS results are a little bit better than what they were before.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
So I guess if we have better used vehicle and better rental, I'm not sure why you're not – I understand Supply Chain is a little weaker, but that's a much smaller part of the business. I guess I'm not entirely sure why you're not raising the outlook for the second half of the year.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Scott, it was – it's really – Supply Chain is obviously being impacted by the lower auto volumes and investments we're making in technology. So those are the – that's really the biggest driver of the offset. And then we've also got some additional investments we're making in other areas of the business that are helping to offset it. But, yeah, that's how the numbers are falling out.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And then if I can just ask just on – staying on used vehicles, so like, if the pricing was a little bit better than you thought in the second quarter, why are you doing the accelerated depreciation? And is that something that you're going to – you plan to do more of going forward? And then how does that impact residual value for 2018? Do you think that's a positive or negative kind of earnings in 2018 residual value?
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, pricing was modestly above where we thought. I don't want you to think it was significantly above to begin with, so we'll have to just look at it. Obviously, increasing price is always going to help us from an accelerated depreciation, but, I mean, for the quarter it wasn't a big impact to the process of what we're trying to get done with that. So I think from that sense, I don't think it's going to have a big impact. We'll have to wait and see as we get further down to the year to decide around accelerated depreciation.

Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
And then just thoughts on residual value for next year.
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, the residual values, I mean, remember, it was only up modestly, so I don't think it has a big effect on where we are. So our views about the residual impact is still there, it's what we think. We're going to have some additional headwind next year around some residual value changes. So that really hasn't changed.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. All right, thank you, guys.
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Okay.

And we'll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel.
David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Just continuing on the ChoiceLease side, the higher maintenance costs that were talked about in the quarter on older vehicles, you talked about it on the last call as well. Were they, I guess, as expected, higher? Or were they higher than you had expected them to be? And what does the tail look like on these older vehicles?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, these are – they were in-line with what we had expected. I would argue, maybe slightly – actually, maintenance costs were little bit better than what we had expected, but these are units that are going to be really exiting the fleet within the next, I'd call it, 18 months. So you're really talking about through 2018. So these are the more challenging units. We're going to be replacing those during that period of time, so that's – those are the vehicles – that's the item that we're mentioning.
David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. So this is still the 2012 problem child. Had there been any other issues that have popped up since kind of the 2012-2013 model years where maintenance costs have been higher than you expected when you wrote the contracts?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
No, no, we're seeing relatively good performance really on all the vehicles after those.
David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
And then last question on the lease side relates actually more to the maintenance under FMS. The vehicles that are under On-Demand Maintenance still seeing good growth there, but is the profitability tracking as expected?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, it is. It is. As we've mentioned before, obviously the growth – it hasn't grown to the level that we want it to grow yet. It's growing slower. But certainly, it gives us an opportunity to tap into a different market than we have historically and also give us more flexibility around some of the SelectCare and ChoiceLease offerings.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
David, it's Dennis. I would just add to that, as Robert was saying, that we thought this would be a door-opener to, as an entrée for a lot of customers, an on-ramp, if you will, where once they've come in and experienced our maintenance, we're able to sell them up to other SelectCare and even ChoiceLease products.
David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
A door opener but not loss leader.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Correct. No, no.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
No, no. Absolutely not. Profitability is in line.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Profitability is in line with our earlier expectation.

We'll take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital.
Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.
Thank you very much. Hi, everyone.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Morning.
Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.
A couple questions here. One having to do with fleet size. So, if I'm thinking about what you're saying correctly, we're going to add about 2,000, I guess 2,600 vehicles, to Full Service lease before the end of the year, and then I think we were originally thinking the rental fleet may be sized down, but it sounds like you're saying we're going to be around that 37,000 vehicle-count in rental. Can you kind of tell me whether I'm barking up the right tree or heading in the wrong direction?

Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
We're going to be – I know you're – on the ChoiceLease side, you're exactly right. We're on our original plan. On the rental, Dennis, you've got -
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Rental will take it down slightly, but that's just what we do seasonally. But as we said, the demand is slightly stronger than what we had originally projected, so we won't be taking the fleet down as much as we originally planned.
Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.
And that's based on the 75.6% utilization rate, that's just saying we shouldn't reduce it by that much. Okay. And then a follow-up question, you've raised your targeted leverage range, and I know historically we've said when we get below the range we start to consider things like share buyback in excess of anti-dilutive. So, does that logic still hold as you plan to be below the range toward the end of year?
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah. No, our position hasn't changed. We're committed to staying within our target leverage range, but as we talked about before, it's always predicated on the views of what our organic growth opportunities are, what M&A is out there, things like that as a way to first – be the first call on capital, if you will. So, our view hasn't changed and we'll continue to look at it as we go forward. We're only slightly below by the end of the year as it is.
Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.
Okay, fair point. And then finally, you had talked about how the realization on some of the vehicle sales has been a little bit better than what you anticipated. Can you give us a little more context as to whether or not it's a particular kind of geography, a particular kind of vehicle type? And kind of how have you been surprised and how is this changing your view on where we go with used vehicle sales?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I'd say it's modestly better and it's really – it's been trucks. If I had to say one of them, trucks have come in a little better – came in a little better in the second quarter than we expected. Tractors, it's hard to tell if they're better. The decline certainly year-over-year has subsided some. So, there's some talk out there that maybe the prices are bottoming out right now. There's still a lot if inventory in the market, so we're still focused on moving those units out. I wouldn't say it's really changed our outlook much yet. Obviously, we'd have to see several quarters of stabilization of pricing and then continued volumes moving out so our inventories come down before we change our view.
Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.
Okay. Well, congratulations and thank you.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.
Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, you talked about the SCS already in auto. I wanted to ask what you're seeing on the retail side. Obviously, there is – they argue (41:20) there's more disruption than just some retooling and production that you're seeing in auto. You do see a broader push into omni-channel and final-mile, broadly speaking, so, just wondering if you could give us some thoughts on that vertical and if you're seeing any trouble finding the right sort of staffing levels, operating locations, as more and more focus tends to be on getting the warehouse, the fulfillment centers, in general, closer to the end consumer.
J. Steven Sensing - Ryder System, Inc.
No, Brian, I think that as you look at the quarter, we had nice growth in retail CPG at 14%, so we're seeing again a consistent healthy pipeline in that book of business. The team's focused on several initiatives, which is just as you described to get product closer to our customers and to continue to build-out our final-mile solutions. So, very focused in that area. And I think the omni-channel e-commerce is going to really impact positively all verticals as we look out in the far term. So, we're excited about that and I think positioned well.

Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And any trouble finding labor force in an area that you're expanding in or just flat-out finding the space? I know oftentimes you get a lease with a contract, so just some thoughts on how that's progressing in the last quarter and how you think that's going to pan out for rest of the year?
J. Steven Sensing - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, our head count is up year-over-year about 12%. I would say that our time to fill is pretty consistent over last year, so not really seeing any negative impact to that. Space remains available. In key markets, certainly you're going to go into some ZIP codes and have pressure there, but there is a lot of new construction in these key areas, as well. We just recently opened up a brand new 1 million square foot for a customer up in the Northeast. So you may see some compression, but, right now, we haven't seen anything to speak of.
Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks. And on the used vehicle side, obviously a lot has been talked about already. I was just wondering if you've done any work and have some historical context just about shadow inventory, if we do get stabilization to actually improvement in pricing in the markets. Do you have a sense of just how much additional supply could come to the market if we get a sort of stable to increasing path here? I don't know if you could size it relative to what you have currently, or just maybe some broader comments would be helpful.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, look, when we kind of determined our view of this, we build that into our view, right? So, as we look at what we think, we assume used vehicle pricing is going to remain soft at least through middle of next year. That is assuming that there is clearly – there's always been a shadow inventory out there that's kind of waiting for pricing to come up so it could come to market, so, we're expecting that's out there and that's going to – that would continue to kind of create some pressure. So, I would argue – I would tell you that's kind of – that's already built into our view.
Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that, do you have just a rough sense of how big, how wide the shadow has cast? If it's – like you say, there's always something there, but just some way to think about it relative to, I don't know, this time last year or at the trough of the last cycle would be helpful.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think – look, I think you've seen some of the stuff we had last year come to market already as vehicles continue to depreciate with carriers and with shippers that are out – I mean, with fleets that are out there. So, you've seen some of that already coming to market and I think as pricing comes back up and vehicles continue to appreciate, there's still more to be at, because there was a lot of vehicles built in 2012 and 2013 and into 2014, so, those vehicles will cycle through as pricing comes up.
Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thanks for your time.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.

We'll take our next question from Casey Deak with Wells Fargo.
Casey S. Deak - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the asset management, and specifically with things getting a little better here in the rental and some of the pricing on used vehicle sales, does your strategy change at all or when you're looking at shifting assets around? Or would your ability to do that shift at all going into the back half of the year? Do you still have runway to move rental – or to move older lease vehicles into rental if you must and if that's going to help the overall operation?

Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, Casey, this is Dennis. We're always looking at vehicles that come off lease and still have more mileage left, and we'll look at bringing them into rental if it makes sense. So, we're constantly looking at that from an asset management point of view. And on the other hand, we're always looking at opportunities to take rental vehicles and move them into longer term lease commitments, and so we continue to do that. Nothing has changed there.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
So, there is still some opportunity. I'd say, to the back end of your question is that we have opportunity for the balance of the year. There is some. I mean, obviously it's not an infinite number, but there's opportunity if demand comes a little higher to bring some additional vehicles into the rental fleet.
Casey S. Deak - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And kind of on top of that, the CapEx comments around rental being a little higher proportion of what you're doing there in the CapEx, is that generally going to be just replenishment? You're not looking, because you are taking, you said, a little bit down on the overall fleet number, so, what's like the percentage of the fleet there that you think you have to turn over on an annual basis or this year?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, it's all replacement really. We're going to spend $250 million this year, $250 million to $300 million we're going to spend in rental, and that's really all replacement. Replacement spend for us is probably around $400 million, so we're even sub our normal replacement where last year we only spent $90 million. So, we've really had two years of sub-replacement level, which, as we move into the next few years, you'll probably see some of that come up.
Casey S. Deak - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

We'll take our next question from Kevin Sterling with Seaport Global Securities.
Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Thank you, good morning, gentlemen.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC
So, Robert, you talked about the greater use of used equipment to fulfill lease contracts. Maybe you can give us some perspective, is this higher than historical norms? And maybe what is the average age of used equipment you're putting on a lease now? So, maybe just, you could put in some historical context for us, like I said, is this typical, is this higher than typically you've seen in the past? And then lastly, how much of a discount does a customer get on a lease price by taking a piece of used equipment, if any?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, it is higher than historical norms. There is some discount we don't really get into that, but it's just, in some cases, a slight discount to take a somewhat older vehicle, in terms of the age of what we're redeploying.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I would say, Kevin, it would be in the range of two years to three years in that range and customers who are looking for used equipment, it's a nice option. And then if we see strong rental demand, we'll backfill it with a new unit, so this is one of the ways to keep the rental fleet refreshed or to downsize the rental fleet when you're seeing soft demand. So we're open for business when it comes to, as we call it, rental to lease options.
Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Yeah, and I imagine, and correct me if I'm wrong, you guys have probably gotten good traction with this because of your superior maintenance program, and customers understand that. Is that a fair statement?
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think customers look at the uptime that we provide with our maintenance and it's viewed favorably and the equipments that they're buying, the used equipments, they know it's taken care of very well.

Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC
And so last along those lines, you guys had mentioned – Robert, you talked about getting vehicles ready for sale. That seems to be little bit higher than I think historical norms from what I can remember. And with some of the engine complexities and everything, does it cost more to get these vehicles ready for sale than historically maybe a couple years ago?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
That's a good question. Just to give you the background, we had plenty of vehicles to sell several quarters ago. We started slowing down a little bit, the process of getting them out-serviced and, at the end of the first quarter, we had I think 1,700 vehicles above normal, if you will, in that process of getting ready for sale. So we really bit into that pretty well this year. We took a nice chunk out of it. We are down to 900 vehicles now over the normal, and plan to be at normal levels by the end of the year.
So yes, there is some cost to doing that. I would tell you because of the technology that cost would naturally go up; however, we're very pleased that Dennis and his team have done a great job of focusing on streamlining some of that work and actually bringing those costs down over the last year to two years. So yes, it naturally would go up, but I'd say the initiatives that we've put in place and Dennis's team have put in place and executed have really helped to bring those costs down.
Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Well, great. Thanks for your time today. I really appreciate it. Take care.

We'll take our next question from John Cummings with Copeland Capital.
John R. Cummings - Copeland Capital Management LLC
Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about the deceleration you've seen in the ChoiceLease business over the past few quarters in terms of revenue going from sort of the mid-single digit range to now 2%, and it sounds like that's consistent with your expectations, but can you just talk about what's driving that maybe in terms of market share or competition or just general trends towards outsourcing?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I would tell you that the 2% was in line with our expectation. It just has to do with the timing of when sales happen, when customers want vehicles. We're really on track for our 4% number for the full year. And in terms of the slowdown, you would argue from 4% versus the 6%, 7% that we saw last year, it's really been a result of just the lower OEM production. You've got fewer opportunities to go after as fewer trucks are being built, so even though we're still getting more than our fair share of it with the trends towards outsourcing, you're just not seeing as many opportunities as we did just a couple of years ago with OEM production being down. So Dennis, you want to add a little color?
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, Robert, what I'd add to it is when you look at the mix of new versus used, as we've been redeploying more units, you've got used equipment that doesn't get as high a price, but more revenue – less revenue than we would see with new equipment. So another piece, Robert.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
That's a good point, yeah. The elevated levels of redeployment we have do impact that revenue growth some too. So those are probably the two biggest factors.
John R. Cummings - Copeland Capital Management LLC
Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up in terms of pricing of leasing contracts. How does a potential increase in interest rates affect the pricing? And then maybe what interest rates are the most important, the short-term or long-term?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.

Well, we price our vehicles really based on our medium-term notes, which is really how we fund, how we fund the five-year notes, so that's how we fund the assets. So the way that our pricing works is as interest rates change, we immediately make the change in our pricing model, and the next vehicle that we buy is going to be bought with the – and we price is going to be priced with the higher interest rate.
John R. Cummings - Copeland Capital Management LLC
Okay, thanks. That's helpful.

And we'll take a follow-up question from Ben Hartford with Baird.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hi, thanks. Since we haven't exhausted the used equipment pricing discussion enough yet, the U.S. dollar is weakened by almost 10% year-to-date, and globally it seems like end-markets are generally improving. Are we near enough, given the combination of both, particularly that dollar weakness year-to-date where some of the offshoring opportunities with regard to these tractors is beginning to open up? And if we're not close yet, is there a sense as to how much further depreciation of a dollar we need before those export opportunities, that window may open back up?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, I think it's still hard to tell. There was reports of some additional exports to Vietnam. I'd say it was pretty concentrated with one OEM. But beyond that, I think, obviously dollar going down is good for exports, but we haven't – and I'll let Dennis comment if we've seen anything recently in terms of improvement in that export market.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, not really. We keep looking at it and, as we've written assets down, we look at whether or not a market like Vietnam starts to make sense. So the answer, Ben, is we're constantly evaluating it, but there is no real change at this point in time.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then a follow-up for Art on the long-term – the raising of the long-term debt-to-equity target. You obviously kept the year-end target the same. Any reason why not to raise the year-end target in conjunction with the raising of the long-term target? And I guess that's one question.
And then in a related vein, when do you expect any decisions to be made as to how quickly you do deploy capital to push you into that longer-term range? Do you expect that decision during the back half of this year? Or is that something that as you get through the budgeting process for 2018 and you make a decision toward 2018, or more liquidity or something at that point in time?
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, that's it, Ben. So, I think our view is the year-end number at 240% was unchanged is based on the business outlook, what's happening. We're going to, as we complete our business plan, look out for the next year, that's probably when we'll make some decision as to what do we think leverage is going to do and how we react to that. So, it's more probably a year-end kind of decision.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
And what changed during this quarter to give you confidence to re-engage that prior 2013 longer-term target again?
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, it's a combination of factors. As we look at our business metrics, how we're reviewed by the agencies and the like, all that factors into our view as to completing our outlook for a few years as to what we think the metrics are going to do and if we were comfortable raising it back to that target.
Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay, that's great. Thanks for the time, guys.
Operator
And we'll take our last question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC

Hey, guys thanks, appreciate it. So, just a last couple things. The increase in extensions, what's driving that and what does that tell you about the leasing market?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah, that – the increase in extensions that you see is a pretty big spike up. It's primarily one customer that had a significant number of trailers that we extended on that lease. So I wouldn't read a lot into that big increase.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay, good. Do you, by any chance, have utilization for rental or demand for rental on a monthly basis including July?
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
We've got – I know we've got through June. We got to – digging it up here.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
And maybe, while – go ahead.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Scott, it's – we're seeing in July for Power is in the 77% range. I'm sorry.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
April, May, June.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
April, May, June. So it was, again for Power, utilization was, call it, 72% in April; May, 76%; and June, 78% and in the 77% range right now.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
And would you say that's – I'm guessing it typically falls from June to July.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Yeah.
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
Seasonally, yes.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And then just last thing – and, sorry, one more on the gains on sales line. Can you just help frame how we should think about 2018? So, you've done some accelerated depreciation, hopefully some more retail versus wholesale next year. Prices may be stabilizing. Should we – any kind of initial thoughts on directionally gains on sales, losses on sales, magnitude of gains on sales for next year? Any color you have or thoughts.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
Scott, there's still a lot to play out this year, but I would, if you just think about what we see right now, assuming UVS doesn't take another big step down or do anything different, I would say you probably want to plan for kind of a neutral UVS year-over-year. We're going to have some additional headwinds in depreciation.
We talked about insurance premiums, also, being a headwind next year. But then the offsets are really the growth in the contractual businesses, the rental. We expect rental – while there's not a big drop-off in demand again, rental should be a positive year-over-year. And then, obviously, cost takeouts as we do every year. I think that's going to be – those are going to be generally the positives in the puts and takes, and again, UVS is still a lot to play out, so it's early to really start to put a stake in the ground, but we'll see that play out over the balance of the year. We've got a lot of work to do over the balance of the year, too.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
That's all very helpful. And just so I'm clear, you're saying neutral year-over-year including this year's accelerated depreciation or are you excluding that?
Dennis C. Cooke - Ryder System, Inc.
No, we were talking just UVS.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
No, we're talking about just UVS gains.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
UVS net impact. What I would tell you, the accelerated depreciation, we mentioned it on the last call, I think, we're saying that that could be $0.10 or $10 million additional when you look at -
Art A. Garcia - Ryder System, Inc.
For next year.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.
For next year. Yeah.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. All right, thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator
At this time, there are no additional questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Robert Sanchez for closing remarks.
Robert E. Sanchez - Ryder System, Inc.

All right, well, we're just past the top of the hour. I think, hopefully, we've got everybody's questions answered and we'll be out and meeting with several of you, I'm sure, over the next few weeks. So, look forward to seeing you then and stay safe. Thank you.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2011)


Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model "A" Ford.[8] Within a few years,[when?] the business expanded to leasing trucks to other companies. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. By 1939, Ryder's truck fleet had increased to 50. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955 Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955.[13] By the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder had expanded into the distribution and supply chain markets.
James A. Ryder, founder and chairman, retired in 1978.[8]
In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing.
Business[edit]
Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. As of 2008, the total company revenue was $6.2 billion, earnings before income taxes of $459 million.
Fleet management[edit]
Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% of its revenue for a total of $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total.[14] This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent.[15] Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.
In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California.[16] Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California,[17] and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.[18]
Supply chain[edit]
Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008.[14]
In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.[19]
Dedicated Contract Carriage[edit]
Ryder Dedicated Contract Carriage accounted for 8% of its revenue for a total of $0.5 billion. Profit of $49 million was 10% of the total.[14] This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated.
Rental trucks[edit]
Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as "one-ways" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive-service locations. In June 1998, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the "one-way" business arena; which it sold to Budget Truck Rental.[20] The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.
Headquarters[edit]
Ryder's headquarters are located in an unincorporated area in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, near the Miami Dade-County, Broward County boundary line.[21][22]
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida.[23] In 2002, after taking a year-long study of 22 potential headquarters sites in South Florida, Ryder announced that it would move its headquarters to another location in northwest Miami-Dade County. The commute times of around 200 employees who reside in Broward County decreased. Before the announcement of the final headquarters site, Ryder considered some locations in Miramar in Broward County.[22] In 2005 Shoma Development Corp. began demolishing the former Ryder headquarters in Doral, replacing it with the Park Square at Doral development.[24]
Ryder also has a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS Operations.
Locations[edit]
Headquartered in Miami, Ryder has satellite locations in 48 US States and also in Mexico, Canada, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.[25]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.[26]

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2011)


Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model "A" Ford.[8] Within a few years,[when?] the business expanded to leasing trucks to other companies. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. By 1939, Ryder's truck fleet had increased to 50. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955 Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955.[13] By the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder had expanded into the distribution and supply chain markets.
James A. Ryder, founder and chairman, retired in 1978.[8]
In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing.
Business[edit]
Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. As of 2008, the total company revenue was $6.2 billion, earnings before income taxes of $459 million.
Fleet management[edit]
Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% of its revenue for a total of $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total.[14] This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent.[15] Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.
In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California.[16] Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California,[17] and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.[18]
Supply chain[edit]
Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008.[14]
In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.[19]
Dedicated Contract Carriage[edit]
Ryder Dedicated Contract Carriage accounted for 8% of its revenue for a total of $0.5 billion. Profit of $49 million was 10% of the total.[14] This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated.
Rental trucks[edit]
Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as "one-ways" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive-service locations. In June 1998, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the "one-way" business arena; which it sold to Budget Truck Rental.[20] The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.
Headquarters[edit]
Ryder's headquarters are located in an unincorporated area in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, near the Miami Dade-County, Broward County boundary line.[21][22]
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida.[23] In 2002, after taking a year-long study of 22 potential headquarters sites in South Florida, Ryder announced that it would move its headquarters to another location in northwest Miami-Dade County. The commute times of around 200 employees who reside in Broward County decreased. Before the announcement of the final headquarters site, Ryder considered some locations in Miramar in Broward County.[22] In 2005 Shoma Development Corp. began demolishing the former Ryder headquarters in Doral, replacing it with the Park Square at Doral development.[24]
Ryder also has a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS Operations.
Locations[edit]
Headquartered in Miami, Ryder has satellite locations in 48 US States and also in Mexico, Canada, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.[25]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.[26]

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2011)


Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model "A" Ford.[8] Within a few years,[when?] the business expanded to leasing trucks to other companies. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. By 1939, Ryder's truck fleet had increased to 50. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955 Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955.[13] By the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder had expanded into the distribution and supply chain markets.
James A. Ryder, founder and chairman, retired in 1978.[8]
In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing.
Business[edit]
Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. As of 2008, the total company revenue was $6.2 billion, earnings before income taxes of $459 million.
Fleet management[edit]
Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% of its revenue for a total of $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total.[14] This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent.[15] Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.
In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California.[16] Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California,[17] and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.[18]
Supply chain[edit]
Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008.[14]
In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.[19]
Dedicated Contract Carriage[edit]
Ryder Dedicated Contract Carriage accounted for 8% of its revenue for a total of $0.5 billion. Profit of $49 million was 10% of the total.[14] This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated.
Rental trucks[edit]
Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as "one-ways" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive-service locations. In June 1998, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the "one-way" business arena; which it sold to Budget Truck Rental.[20] The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.
Headquarters[edit]
Ryder's headquarters are located in an unincorporated area in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, near the Miami Dade-County, Broward County boundary line.[21][22]
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida.[23] In 2002, after taking a year-long study of 22 potential headquarters sites in South Florida, Ryder announced that it would move its headquarters to another location in northwest Miami-Dade County. The commute times of around 200 employees who reside in Broward County decreased. Before the announcement of the final headquarters site, Ryder considered some locations in Miramar in Broward County.[22] In 2005 Shoma Development Corp. began demolishing the former Ryder headquarters in Doral, replacing it with the Park Square at Doral development.[24]
Ryder also has a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS Operations.
Locations[edit]
Headquartered in Miami, Ryder has satellite locations in 48 US States and also in Mexico, Canada, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.[25]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.[26]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2011)


Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model "A" Ford.[8] Within a few years,[when?] the business expanded to leasing trucks to other companies. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. By 1939, Ryder's truck fleet had increased to 50. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955 Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955.[13] By the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder had expanded into the distribution and supply chain markets.
James A. Ryder, founder and chairman, retired in 1978.[8]
In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing.
Business[edit]
Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. As of 2008, the total company revenue was $6.2 billion, earnings before income taxes of $459 million.
Fleet management[edit]
Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 71% of its revenue for a total of $4.4 billion. Profit of $398 million was 86% of the total.[14] This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent.[15] Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.
In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California.[16] Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California,[17] and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.[18]
Supply chain[edit]
Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008.[14]
In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.[19]
Dedicated Contract Carriage[edit]
Ryder Dedicated Contract Carriage accounted for 8% of its revenue for a total of $0.5 billion. Profit of $49 million was 10% of the total.[14] This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated.
Rental trucks[edit]
Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as "one-ways" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive-service locations. In June 1998, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the "one-way" business arena; which it sold to Budget Truck Rental.[20] The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.
Headquarters[edit]
Ryder's headquarters are located in an unincorporated area in northwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, near the Miami Dade-County, Broward County boundary line.[21][22]
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida.[23] In 2002, after taking a year-long study of 22 potential headquarters sites in South Florida, Ryder announced that it would move its headquarters to another location in northwest Miami-Dade County. The commute times of around 200 employees who reside in Broward County decreased. Before the announcement of the final headquarters site, Ryder considered some locations in Miramar in Broward County.[22] In 2005 Shoma Development Corp. began demolishing the former Ryder headquarters in Doral, replacing it with the Park Square at Doral development.[24]
Ryder also has a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, GA that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS Operations.
Locations[edit]
Headquartered in Miami, Ryder has satellite locations in 48 US States and also in Mexico, Canada, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.[25]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.[26]

Real-World Example: Sacramento Laundry





Sacramento Laundry required additional transportation capacity to handle the increased volume of its new 60,000-square-foot laundry facility. This meant reliable access to trucks, some of which average 450 miles per day. The trucks needed to be spec’d to fit the special size of loading docks at hotels. Not to be forgotten, the trucks needed to be cost-effective, as the company had just incurred a major capital outlay in its expansion.




We Offered:


Fleet of 28-foot box trucks that met strict California vehicle regulations
Customer spec’d trucks for easier deliveries
Expert service to increase fleet reliability








The Results:


New, efficient vehicles led to a 40% improvement in gas mileage and $20,000 annual fuel savings
99.5% on-time delivery
24/7 access to replacement vehicles 
Improved emissions compliance

OVERVIEW


The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and notes thereto included under
Item 1. In addition, reference should be made to our audited Consolidated
Financial Statements and notes thereto and related Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2016
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain
management solutions. We report our financial performance based on three
segments: (1) Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), which provides leasing,
commercial rental, and maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers
principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; (2) Dedicated Transportation
Solutions (DTS), which provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated
transportation solution in the U.S.; and (3) Supply Chain Solutions (SCS), which
provides comprehensive supply chain solutions including distribution and
transportation services in North America and Asia. Dedicated transportation
services provided as part of an integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution
to SCS customers are reported in the SCS business segment.


We operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on
numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service
offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to
provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or
alternative services from other third-party vendors. Our customer base includes
enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive,
industrial, food and beverage service, consumer packaged goods (CPG),
transportation and warehousing, technology and healthcare, retail, housing,
business and personal services, and paper and publishing.


In 2016, we expanded our full service lease product line to provide lease
customers additional flexibility, choice and
control in fleet management, and we renamed this lease product line
"ChoiceLease." Our ChoiceLease product line allows customers to select the level
of maintenance they prefer in their leases, from full service or total
bumper-to-bumper coverage to on demand or pay-as-you-go maintenance. We also
combined our historical contract maintenance and our contract-related
maintenance product offerings into a new product line "SelectCare." Our
SelectCare product line allows customers to select the level of maintenance to
keep their fleet running properly, as well as the option to choose where they
want their service delivered. Beginning in 2017, FMS is using these new product
names in its reporting.

This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Please refer to the
"Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this MD&A for information on the
non-GAAP measures included in the MD&A, reconciliations to the most comparable
GAAP financial measure and the reasons why we believe each measure is useful to
investors.

    of this MD&A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue and
    the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors.
(2) Non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures"
    section for a reconciliation of EBT, net earnings and earnings per diluted
    common share to the comparable measures and the reasons why management
    believes these measures are important to investors.



Total revenue and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and
subcontracted transportation) increased 5% and 2%, respectively, in the second
quarter of 2017. For the first half of 2017, total revenue increased 6% and
operating revenue increased 3%. Total revenue in both periods increased due to
higher operating revenue and increased subcontracted transportation passed
through to customers, reflecting new business and higher volumes, as well as
higher fuel costs passed through to customers. Total revenue growth was
partially offset by negative impacts from foreign exchange. Operating revenue in
both periods increased due to higher revenue in the SCS and DTS business
segments and higher ChoiceLease revenue, partially offset by lower commercial
rental revenue and negative impacts from foreign exchange.


EBT decreased 31% and 32% in the second quarter and first half of 2017,
respectively, primarily reflecting lower used vehicle sales and rental results.

Lease and rental revenues represent revenue from our ChoiceLease and commercial
rental product offerings within our FMS segment. Revenues were approximately
$797 million and $1.56 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2017,
respectively, relatively consistent with the second quarter and first half of
2016. For 2017, higher ChoiceLease revenue, driven by growth in the ChoiceLease
fleet and higher prices on replacement vehicles, was offset by lower commercial
rental revenue reflecting lower demand and, to a lesser extent, a negative
impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue
growth by 100 basis points in both periods.

Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental
revenues. These costs consist of depreciation of revenue earning equipment,
maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other costs such as
licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes
interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental increased 4% in
both the second quarter and first half of 2017, primarily due to higher
depreciation and maintenance costs from a 3% larger average lease fleet as well
as higher maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles. Cost of lease
and rental was also impacted by accelerated depreciation on vehicles expected to
be made available for sale through June 2018 of $8 million in the second quarter
and $17 million in the first half of 2017. These increases were partially offset
by lower depreciation on a 6% smaller average rental fleet. Cost of lease and
rental also increased $1 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $2 million in
the first half of 2017, due to changes in estimated residual values effective
January 1, 2017. Foreign exchange reduced cost of lease and rental by 100 basis
points in both periods.

Lease and rental gross margin decreased 10% in the second quarter and 11% in the
first half of 2017. Lease and rental gross margin as a percentage of revenue
decreased to 27% in the second quarter and 26% in the first half of 2017. The
decrease in gross margin dollars in the three and six months ended June 30,
2017, was due to lower commercial rental demand, higher maintenance costs on
certain older model year vehicles and accelerated depreciation. The decrease in
gross margin dollars as a percentage of revenue in the three and six months
ended June 30, 2017, was primarily due to higher maintenance costs on certain
older model year vehicles and accelerated depreciation.

Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our DTS and SCS
segments, as well as SelectCare and fleet support services associated with our
FMS segment. Services revenue increased 11% in the second quarter and 12% in the
first half of 2017 due to increased volumes, new business and higher pricing in
the DTS and SCS segments. Services revenue also benefited from higher fuel costs
passed through to our customers. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue
growth by 100 basis points in both periods.

Cost of services represents the direct costs related to services revenue and is
primarily comprised of salaries and employee-related costs, subcontracted
transportation (purchased transportation from third parties), fuel, vehicle
liability costs and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 14% in the
second quarter and 13% in the first half of 2017 due to higher volumes and
higher fuel costs in SCS and DTS and higher vehicle maintenance costs on certain
older model year vehicles in DTS. Cost of services also increased in the first
half of 2017 due to higher insurance costs in DTS. Foreign exchange reduced cost
of services by 100 basis points in both periods.

Services gross margin decreased 2% in the second quarter and increased 3% in the
first half of 2017. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased
to 16% in both the second quarter and first half of 2017. The decrease in gross
margin dollars in the second quarter, reflects lower operating performance on
certain SCS contracts in the start-up phase, as well as increased maintenance
costs on certain older model year vehicles and higher insurance costs in DTS.
The increase in gross margin dollars in the first half of 2017, reflects
benefits from increased volumes and higher pricing in our SCS segment, partially
offset by higher vehicle maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles
and higher insurance costs in DTS. The decline in gross margin as a percentage
of revenue reflects higher vehicle maintenance and insurance costs in DTS in the
second quarter and first half of 2017.

Fuel services revenue represents fuel services provided to our FMS customers.
Fuel services revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of 2017 and 14% in the
first half of 2017, primarily due to higher fuel prices passed through to
customers.

Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our
customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee-related
costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and
equipment. Cost of fuel services increased 5% in the second quarter and 15% in
the first half of 2017 as a result of higher fuel prices.

Fuel services gross margin decreased 13% in the second quarter and 19% in the
first half of 2017. Fuel services gross margin as a percentage of revenue
remained at 3% in the second quarter and decreased to 3% in the first half of
2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. Fuel is largely a pass-through to
customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of
steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden
increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as
customer pricing for fuel is established based on trailing market fuel costs.

Other operating expenses include costs related to our owned and leased
facilities within the FMS segment, such as facility depreciation, rent,
purchased insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to
provide maintenance to our ChoiceLease, rental, and SelectCare customers. Other
operating expenses decreased slightly to $27.4 million in the second quarter and
increased to $58.7 million in the first half of 2017.

Non-operating pension costs includes the components of our net periodic benefit
cost other than service cost. These components include interest cost, expected
return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost.
Non-operating pension costs decreased $8.8 million in the second quarter and
$8.3 million in the first half of 2017 from the respective prior year periods,
primarily due to a one-time charge of $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2016
to fully reflect pension benefit improvements made in 2009 in our pension
benefit obligation.

Used vehicle sales, net includes gains from sales of used vehicles as well as
the selling costs associated with used vehicles and write-downs of vehicles to
fair market values. Used vehicle sales, net decreased to a loss of $15.3 million
in the second quarter of 2017 and $14.5 million in the first half of 2017,
primarily due to a drop in the market value of trucks and tractors, which
resulted in lower gains on sales and greater fair market value write-downs on
vehicles held for sale. Global average proceeds per unit in the second quarter
decreased from the prior year reflecting a 16% decrease in tractor proceeds per
unit and a 14% decrease in truck proceeds per unit. Global proceeds per unit in
the first half of 2017 decreased from the prior year reflecting a 17% decrease
in trucks proceeds per unit and a 16% decrease in tractor proceeds per unit.

Interest expense decreased 6% in the second quarter of 2017 and 7% in the first
half of 2017, reflecting lower average outstanding debt and a lower effective
interest rate. The decrease in average outstanding debt reflects lower planned
vehicle capital spending. The lower effective interest rate in 2017 reflects the
replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates.

(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures"
    section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating
    revenue, and segment total revenue to segment operating revenue for FMS, DTS
    and SCS, as well as the reasons why management believes these measures are

    important to investors.



As part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance, we define
the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as "Earnings Before
Taxes" (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central
Support Services (CSS), and excludes non-operating pension costs and
restructuring and other items, net discussed in Note 16, "Segment Reporting," in
the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. CSS represents those
costs incurred to support all segments, including human resources, finance,
corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and
safety, legal, marketing and corporate communications.

The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability
of each segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each segment accountable
for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each
segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
Certain costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS,
including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive
compensation.

Inter-segment revenue and EBT are accounted for at rates similar to those
executed with third parties. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services
billed to DTS and SCS customers (equipment contribution) are included in both
FMS and the segment that served the customer and then eliminated (presented as
"Eliminations" in the table above).

The decrease in DTS equipment contribution for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2017 is primarily driven by higher maintenance costs on an older
vehicle fleet used in DTS operations. The increase in SCS equipment contribution
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily driven by
increased volumes.

(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of FMS total revenue to FMS
    operating revenue as well as the reasons why management believes this measure
    is important to investors is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures"

    section of this MD&A.



FMS total revenue increased to $1.16 billion in the second quarter and increased
to $2.30 billion in the first half of 2017 due to higher FMS operating revenue
(a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel) and fuel services revenue, partially offset
by negative impacts from foreign exchange. FMS operating revenue remained
unchanged in the second quarter and the first half of 2017, as a result of
organic growth, primarily in the ChoiceLease product line, offset by lower
commercial rental revenue and negative impacts from foreign exchange. In the
second quarter and first half of 2017, foreign exchange negatively impacted both
total revenue and operating revenue growth by 100 basis points.

ChoiceLease revenue increased 2% in the second quarter and 4% in the first half
of 2017, reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement
vehicles. Foreign exchange negatively impacted ChoiceLease revenue growth by 100
basis points in the second quarter and first half of 2017. We expect favorable
ChoiceLease revenue comparisons to continue through the end of the year based on
sales activity. Commercial rental revenue decreased 7% in the second quarter and
11% in the first half of 2017 due to lower demand. We expect unfavorable
commercial rental revenue comparisons through the end of the year based on the
weak demand environment. SelectCare revenue increased 3% in the second quarter
and 1% in the first half of 2017, due to new business and increased volumes,
partially offset by negative impacts from foreign exchange.

FMS EBT decreased 39% in the second quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting lower
used vehicle sales and, to a lesser extent, commercial rental results, as well
as $8 million of accelerated depreciation on vehicles expected to be made
available for sale through June 2018 and higher maintenance costs on certain
older model year vehicles. FMS EBT decreased 38% in the first half of 2017, due
to lower used vehicle sales and commercial rental results, as well as
accelerated depreciation on vehicles expected to be made available for sale
through June 2018 of $17 million. Used vehicle sales results decreased due to
lower pricing, which resulted in lower gains on sales and greater fair market
value write-downs on vehicles held for sale. Commercial rental results declined
from lower demand in both periods. Second quarter commercial rental results were
favorably impacted by a 90 basis point improvement. However, first half results
were negatively impacted by a 110 basis point decline in utilization.
ChoiceLease results benefited from growth in the average lease fleet size.
ChoiceLease and commercial rental results were negatively impacted by $1 million
of higher depreciation in the second quarter and $2 million in the first half of
2017, due to residual value changes implemented January 1, 2017.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment
to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities
such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration
equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no
revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may
be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment.
NLE units decreased compared to June 30, 2016, reflecting lower used vehicle
inventories, partially offset by a higher number of units being prepared for
sale. We expect NLE levels to decline through the end of the year.

(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of DTS total revenue to DTS
    operating revenue, as well as the reasons why management believes this
    measure is important to investors is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures" section of this MD&A.




In the second quarter of 2017, DTS total revenue and operating revenue (a
non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) increased 6%
and 3%, respectively, primarily due to new business. DTS EBT decreased 10% in
the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher vehicle maintenance costs on
certain older model year vehicles as well as higher insurance premium costs.

In the first half of 2017, DTS total and operating revenue increased 7% and 2%,
respectively, due to new business and higher pricing. We expect DTS total
revenue and DTS operating revenue comparisons to remain favorable through the
end of the year. DTS EBT decreased 15% in the first half of 2017, primarily due
to higher maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles and higher
insurance costs.

(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of SCS total revenue to SCS
    operating revenue, as well as the reasons why management believes this
    measure is important to investors is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures" section of this MD&A.




In the second quarter of 2017, SCS total revenue increased 17%, and SCS
operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted
transportation) increased 8%, reflecting new business, increased volumes and
higher pricing. SCS EBT decreased 9% in the second quarter of 2017, primarily
related to the start-up phase of certain new accounts.

In the first half of 2017, SCS total revenue increased 18%, reflecting organic
growth, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. SCS
operating revenue increased 10% due to increased volumes, new business and
higher pricing, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. We
expect SCS total revenue and SCS operating revenue comparisons to remain
favorable through the end of the year, with SCS operating revenue at a lower
growth rate. SCS EBT increased 11% in the first half of 2017 primarily due to
increased volumes and higher pricing.

Cash Flows
The following is a summary of our cash flows from continuing operations:

                                          Six months ended June 30,

Net change in cash and cash equivalents $      (3,083 )        5,320




Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $732 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $763 million in 2016, due to lower
earnings and higher working capital needs, partially offset by lower pension
contributions. Cash used in financing activities was $122 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, compared with cash provided from financing
activities of $69 million in 2016, due to lower borrowing needs. Cash used in
investing activities decreased to $616 million in the six months ended June 30,
2017, compared with $823 million in 2016, primarily due to lower payments for
capital expenditures.


The following table shows our free cash flow computation:

Capital expenditures decreased 8% to $933 million in the six months ended June
30, 2017, reflecting planned lower investments in our lease fleet, partially
offset by higher planned investments to refresh our commercial rental fleet. We
expect full-year 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion. We
expect to fund 2017 capital expenditures primarily with internally generated
funds and additional debt financing.


Financing and Other Funding Transactions


We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and
growth in our asset-based product lines. The variety of debt financing
alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial
paper, long-term and medium-term public and private debt, asset-backed
securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities.
Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and
medium-term public debt.

Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both
our short-term and long-term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide
guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular
Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies
from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher
borrowing costs, as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A
significant downgrade of our short-term debt ratings would impair our ability to
issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding
sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts
under our revolving credit facility described below, assuming ongoing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the credit facility.


Our debt ratings and rating outlooks at June 30, 2017, were as follows:

                                       Rating Summary
                                   Short-Term   Long-Term   Outlook
Fitch Ratings                         F-2          A-       Stable

Standard & Poor's Ratings Services    A-2         BBB+      Stable
Moody's Investors Service
             P-2         Baa1      Stable



Cash and cash equivalents totaled $55 million as of June 30, 2017. As of
June 30, 2017, approximately $28 million was held outside the U.S. and is
available to fund operations and other growth of non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we
decide to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S., we may be
subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. However,
our intent is to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S. and
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these foreign amounts
to fund our U.S. operations.

We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to the public
unsecured bond market, commercial paper market and other available debt
financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs
in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated
volatility and disruption in the public unsecured debt market or the commercial
paper market would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms
commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to public
bonds, commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet
our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements
as described below and/or by seeking other funding sources.

In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to align the aggregate
average remaining re-pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average
remaining re-pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed-rate and
variable-rate debt to achieve this alignment and generally target a mix of 20% -
40% variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The
variable-rate portion of our total debt (including notional value of swap
agreements) was 33% and 30% as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
respectively.

Refer to Note 6, "Debt," in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility,
the trade receivables program, the issuance of medium-term notes under our shelf
registration statement, asset-backed financing obligations and debt maturities.

Ryder's debt to equity ratios were 256% and 263% as of June 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, respectively. The debt to equity ratio represents total debt
divided by total equity. The Company has revised its target debt to equity ratio
to 250% to 300%.

Pension Information


The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including
returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We
review pension assumptions regularly and may, from time to time, make voluntary
contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by
statute. In 2017, the expected total contributions to our pension plans are
approximately $23 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we
contributed $7.2 million to our pension plans. Changes in interest rates and the
market value of the securities held by the plans during 2017 could materially
change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the
level of pension expense and contributions in 2017 and beyond. See Note 12,
"Employee Benefit Plans," in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements for additional information.


Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends
See Note 8, "Share Repurchase Programs," in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed
Financial Statements for a discussion of share repurchases.
In May 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44
per share of common stock. In July 2017, our Board of Directors declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.46 per common share of common stock.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES


This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information extracted from
consolidated condensed financial information but not required by generally
accepted accounting principles in the United Stats of America (U.S. GAAP) to be
presented in the financial statements. Certain elements of this information are
considered "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined by SEC rules. Non-GAAP
financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute
for or superior to, other measures of financial performance or liquidity
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP financial measures may
not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies. We provide a
reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP measure in this non-GAAP financial measures section. We
also provide the reasons why management believes each non-GAAP financial measure
is useful to investors in this section.
Specifically, we refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures in this Form

      ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)



Set forth in the table below is an explanation of each non-GAAP financial
measure and why management believes that presentation of each non-GAAP financial
measure provides useful information to investors:
   Operating Revenue
   Measures:
   Operating Revenue          Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for
   FMS Operating Revenue      Ryder System, Inc. or each business segment (FMS, DTS
   DTS Operating Revenue      and SCS), respectively, excluding any (1) fuel and (2)
   SCS Operating Revenue      subcontracted transportation. We believe operating
   FMS EBT as a % of FMS      revenue provides useful information to investors as we
   Operating Revenue          use it to evaluate the operating performance of our
   DTS EBT as a % of DTS      core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at
   Operating Revenue          the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well
   SCS EBT as a % of SCS      as for each of our business segments. We also use
   Operating Revenue          segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating
                              revenue for each business segment for the same reason.
                              Note: FMS EBT, DTS EBT and SCS EBT, our primary
                              measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP
                              measures.
                              Fuel: We exclude FMS, DTS and SCS fuel from the
                              calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel
                              is an ancillary service that we provide our customers,
                              which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel
                              prices, and the costs are largely a pass-through to
                              our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our
                              profitability during periods of steady market fuel
                              prices. However, profitability may be positively or
                              negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel
                              prices during a short period of time, as customer
                              pricing for fuel services is established based on
                              trailing market fuel costs.
                              Subcontracted transportation: We also exclude
                              subcontracted transportation from the calculation of
                              our operating revenue measures, as these services are
                              also typically a pass-through to our customers and,
                              therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to
                              our profitability. While our DTS and SCS business
                              segments subcontract certain transportation services
                              to third party providers, our FMS business segment
                              does not engage in subcontracted transportation and,
                              therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS.
   Comparable Earnings
   Measures:
   Comparable earnings before Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS
   income tax (EBT)           are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and
   Comparable Earnings        EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1)
   Comparable earnings per    non-operating pension costs and (2) any other
   diluted common share (EPS) significant items that are not representative of our
                              business operations. We believe these comparable
                              earnings measures provide useful information to
                              investors and allow for better year-over-year
                              comparison of operating performance.
                              Non-Operating Pension Costs: Our comparable earnings
                              measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which
                              include the amortization of net actuarial loss and
                              prior service cost, interest cost and expected return
                              on plan assets components of pension and
                              postretirement benefit costs. We exclude non-operating
                              pension costs because we consider these to be impacted
                              by financial market performance and outside the
                              operational performance of our business.
                              Other Significant Items: Our comparable earnings
                              measures also exclude other significant items that are
                              not representative of our business operations. These
                              other significant items vary from period to period
                              and, in some periods, there may be no such significant
                              items. In the three and six months periods ended June
                              30, 2017, we exclude the following other significant
                              items from our comparable earnings measures in this
                              Form 10-Q:
                              ___(1) Restructuring: In the second quarter of 2017,
                              we recorded restructuring credits related to the gains
                              on sale of certain UK facilities.
                                 (2) Operating tax adjustment: In the first quarter
                              of 2017, we recorded a one-time charge of $2.2 million
                              related to operating tax expenses that had not been
                              recognized in prior period earnings.
                                 (3) Pension-related adjustments: In the second
                              quarter of 2016, it was determined that certain
                              pension benefit improvements made in 2009 were not
                              fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation,
                              resulting in a charge to reflect those pension
                              benefits.
                              Calculation of comparable tax rate: The comparable
                              provision for income taxes is computed using the same
                              methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes.
                              Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are
                              calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the
                              jurisdictions to which the non-GAAP adjustments
                              relate.

Cash Flow Measures:
Total Cash Generated       We consider total cash generated and free cash flow to
Free Cash Flow             be important measures of comparative operating
                           performance, as our principal sources of operating
                           liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from
                           the sale of revenue earning equipment.
                           Total Cash Generated: Total cash generated is defined
                           as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating
                           activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of
                           revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by
                           the sale of operating property and equipment, (4)
                           collections on direct finance leases and (5) other
                           cash inflows from investing activities. We believe
                           total cash generated is an important measure of total
                           cash flows generated from our ongoing business
                           activities.
                           Free Cash Flow: We refer to the net amount of cash
                           generated from operating activities and investing
                           activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and
                           acquisitions) from continuing operations as "free cash
                           flow". We calculate free cash flow as the sum of (1)
                           net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net
                           cash provided by the sale of revenue earning
                           equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of
                           operating property and equipment, (4) collections on
                           direct finance leases and (5) other cash inflows from
                           investing activities, less (6) purchases of property
                           and revenue earning equipment. We believe free cash
                           flow provides investors with an important perspective
                           on the cash available for debt service and for
                           shareholders, after making capital investments
                           required to support ongoing business operations. Our
                           calculation of free cash flow may be different from
                           the calculation used by other companies and,
                           therefore, comparability may be limited.

These statements, as well as other forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain
important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly
from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. These risk factors
include, but are not limited to, the following:


• Market Conditions:


                 Changes in general economic and financial conditions in the U.S.
         Ÿ       and worldwide leading to decreased demand for our services,
                 lower profit margins, increased levels of bad debt and reduced
                 access to credit


         Ÿ       Decreases in freight demand which would impact both our
                 transactional and variable-based contractual business


                 Changes in our customers' operations, financial condition or
         Ÿ       business environment that may limit their need for, or ability
                 to purchase, our services


                 Further decreases in market demand affecting the commercial
         Ÿ       rental market and used vehicle sales as well as global economic
                 conditions


         Ÿ       Volatility in customer volumes and shifting customer demand in
                 the industries serviced by our SCS business


         Ÿ       Changes in current financial, tax or regulatory requirements
                 that could negatively impact the leasing market


• Competition:


                 Advances in technology may require increased investments to
         Ÿ       remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to
                 accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments


                 Competition from other service providers, some of which have
         Ÿ       greater capital resources or lower capital costs, or from our
                 customers, who may choose to provide services themselves


         Ÿ       Continued consolidation in the markets in which we operate which
                 may create large competitors with greater financial resources


                 Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to economic
         Ÿ       conditions, demand for services, customer acceptance or
                 competition

         Ÿ       contracts prove to be inaccurate


  Ÿ   Increased unionizing, labor strikes and work stoppages


                 Difficulties in attracting and retaining drivers and technicians
         Ÿ       due to driver and technician shortages, which may result in

  Ÿ   Our inability to manage our cost structure

  Ÿ   Unanticipated interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations


                 Negative funding status of our pension plans caused by lower

                 Withdrawal liability as a result of our participation in
         Ÿ       multi-employer plans

                 higher borrowing costs and/or reduced access to credit

         Ÿ       business strategies, asset valuations, acquisitions,
                 divestitures and our organizational structure


  Ÿ   Reductions in residual values or useful lives of revenue earning equipment


                 Increases in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality
         Ÿ       resulting in higher pension expense; regulatory changes
                 affecting pension estimates, accruals and expenses


  Ÿ   Increases in health care costs resulting in higher insurance costs


  Ÿ   Changes in accounting rules, assumptions and accruals

         Ÿ       compared to historical loss development factors used to project
                 future development


                 Lower than expected operating performance in our FMS Europe
         Ÿ       reporting unit could affect key assumptions used in our annual
                 goodwill impairment test and result in impairment



•      Other risks detailed from time to time in our SEC filings including our
       2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
