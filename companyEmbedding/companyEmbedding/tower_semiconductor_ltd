Overview[edit]
The company manufactures integrated circuits for semiconductor companies such as: Avago Technologies, Fairchild Semiconductor ,[8] Intel ,[9] International Rectifier, Panasonic, RF Micro Devices, Samsung, Skyworks Solutions, Texas Instruments and Vishay – Siliconix. For global capacity assurance, TowerJazz operates seven manufacturing facilities on three continents: Fab 1 and Fab 2 (150mm and 200mm) located in Migdal Haemek, Israel, Fab 3 and Fab 9 (200mm) located in Newport Beach, California and in San Antonio, Texas and three additional fabs (two 200mm and one 300mm) through TPSCo located in the Hokuriku region of Japan. In addition, TowerJazz operates a worldwide design center in Netanya, Israel.
Tower Semiconductor (TowerJazz) is an Israeli public company that is traded on NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and is included in the TA-100 Index and the TA BlueTech Index. In 2010, TowerJazz became the #1 specialty foundry by revenue, with 70% revenue growth year-over-year.[10]
History[edit]
Tower Semiconductor was founded in 1993, with the acquisition of National Semiconductor’s 150mm wafer fabrication facility. Tower became a public company in 1994 and shares are traded on NASDAQ (TSEM) and Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TSEM). In January 2001, an adjacent, state-of-the-art facility (Fab 2) was constructed.
In September 2008, Tower acquired Jazz Semiconductor in a stock for stock transaction. In November 2009, the combined companies officially launched as TowerJazz. The merger provided several key benefits: increased global capacity, cross-selling opportunities among diverse customer bases of both companies, a more comprehensive product portfolio, and a stronger financial base.
In June 2011, TowerJazz acquired Micron Technology’s fabrication facility in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo, Japan. The acquisition nearly doubled TowerJazz’s 2010 internal manufacturing capacity and cost-effectively increased production by 60,000 wafers per month.
In April 2014, TowerJazz announced the successful transaction with Panasonic Corporation (First Section of TSE and NSE ticker: 6752) to form a newly established Japanese company, TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co. (TPSCo) for the manufacture of Panasonic and additional third party products. TowerJazz announced cessation of its Nishiwaki facility operations in the course of rationalizing and restructuring its manufacturing and business activities in Japan. This enables the company to reduce its annual fixed costs by approximately $130 million per annum.
In February 2016, TowerJazz announced the successful acquisition of an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility in San Antonio, Texas, United States from Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., the consideration, of $40 million was paid by approximately 3.3 million ordinary TowerJazz shares. This acquisition increased TowerJazz's production by 28,000 wafers per month.

Fab 1[edit]
Fab 1, located in Migdal Haemek, Israel is a 150mm facility which was acquired from National Semiconductor in 1993 at the time of Tower Semiconductor’s founding. Since that time, Fab 1 has been significantly modernized and offers process geometries ranging from 1.0-micron to 0.35-micron including CMOS image sensors, embedded flash and mixed-signal technologies.
Fab 2[edit]
Fab 2, a 200mm facility was constructed in January 2001, adjacent to Fab 1 in Migdal Haemek, Israel and was designed to operate in geometries of 0.18-micron and below, using advanced CMOS technology.
Fab 3[edit]
Fab 3, located in Newport Beach, California, USA was acquired by Tower when it merged with Jazz Technologies in 2008. Jazz Semiconductor was formed in 2002 and inherited the 200mm facility that was once operated by Rockwell Semiconductor. At Fab 3, Jazz established industry leading SiGe, BiCMOS and MEMS technologies and expanded upon its heritage for on-shore, specialized foundry services focused on the Aerospace and Defense industry.
Additional three fabs through TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co. (TPSCo)[edit]
TPSCo is 51% owned by Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ: TSEM, TASE: TSEM) and 49% owned by Panasonic Corporation (NASDAQ ADS: PCRFY, TYO: 6752). TPSCo has three manufacturing facilities in Hokuriku, Japan (Uozu, Tonami, and Arai) which have been producing large scale integrated circuits for over 30 years. Areas of process technology focus include high dynamic range image sensors (CIS and CCD), integrated power devices (BCD, SOI and LDMOS) and high frequency silicon RFCMOS. TPSCo offers both IDMs and fabless companies over 120 qualified silicon process flows on 200mm and 300mm substrates from super micron to 45 nm, as well as internal back end processing, assembly and test services.

TowerJazzThe Global Specialty Foundry Leader
Over the past several years, TowerJazz has presented record business and financial results while driving customers’ success. As we move forward, we continue with a strong outlook for company growth through a commitment to performance and manufacturing excellence.





TowerJazz, the global specialty foundry leader, specializes in manufacturing analog integrated circuits for more than 300 customers worldwide in growing markets such as automotive, medical, industrial, consumer and aerospace and defense, among others.

          Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ: TSEM, TASE: TSEM) and its fully owned U.S. subsidiaries Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. and TowerJazz Texas Inc., operate collectively under the brand name TowerJazz. TowerJazz also operates three fabrication facilities in Japan through TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co. (TPSCo), a company established with Panasonic Corporation in March 2014.
        
TowerJazz offers a broad range of customizable process technologies, including SiGe BiCMOS and RF CMOS (SOI and bulk) for radio frequency and high performance analog (HPA) applications; CMOS image sensor (CIS); power management, including BCD and 700V, and its patented Y-Flash, the leading solution for non-volatile memory (NVM); CMOS; mixed-signal CMOS; and MEMS capabilities.
To complement its sophisticated technology offerings, TowerJazz provides a world-class design enablement platform that enables a quick and accurate design cycle. TowerJazz also provides transfer, optimization and development process services (TOPS™) to IDMs as well as fabless companies that need to expand capacity, or progress from an R&D line to a production line. For on-shore aerospace and defense customers in the U.S., TowerJazz offers a wide range of technologies for applications including Large Die ROICs, MEMS and millimeter wave devices, among others. In addition, TowerJazz provides “Trusted” foundry services in its Newport Beach, California facility through its subsidiary, Jazz Semiconductor Trusted Foundry (JSTF), as accredited by the U.S. Department of Defense.
TowerJazz is geographically and culturally diverse with broad and deep experience in manufacturing many different types of technologies. TowerJazz is a pure play foundry, so even though the company helps its customers with design and technical support to enable manufacturing of their products, TowerJazz does not compete with its customers. Instead, TowerJazz forms an integrated team with its customers to translate from product to device to process to recipe to tool such that the best manufacturing process can be utilized.
Deeply rooted in proven technologies, the company continues to drive innovation within silicon rather than by pure technological nodal shrinkage and specializes in customized analog solutions for differentiated products.
As the global specialty foundry leader in technology and manufacturing, TowerJazz pursues excellence in all aspects of its business by maintaining industry expertise and cultivating a collective culture of quality, innovation, and trust. Working with TowerJazz, customers are considered valued partners. From initial discussions outlining requirements to customizing and executing an optimal solution, TowerJazz experts work closely with customers every step of the way.
For global capacity assurance, TowerJazz operates seven manufacturing facilities in three geographic locations, providing its diversified customer base with over 2.3 million wafers per year: two fabs (150mm and 200mm) located in Migdal Haemek, Israel, one fab (200mm) located in Newport Beach, California, USA, one fab located in San Antonio, Texas, USA and three additional fabs (two 200mm and one 300mm) through TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (TPSCo) located in the Hokuriku region of Japan. 
TowerJazz employs approximately 4,500 employees worldwide.
As TowerJazz expands its capabilities, manufacturing capacity and global reach, the company continues to build on its market and technology leadership to maintain its worldwide leadership position.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The merger provided several key benefits: increased global capacity, cross-selling opportunities among diverse customer bases of both companies, a more comprehensive product portfolio, and a stronger financial base.
In June 2011, TowerJazz acquired Micron Technology’s fabrication facility in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo, Japan. The acquisition nearly doubled TowerJazz’s 2010 internal manufacturing capacity and cost-effectively increased production by 60,000 wafers per month.
In April 2014, TowerJazz announced the successful transaction with Panasonic Corporation (First Section of TSE and NSE ticker: 6752) to form a newly established Japanese company, TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co. (TPSCo) for the manufacture of Panasonic and additional third party products. TowerJazz announced cessation of its Nishiwaki facility operations in the course of rationalizing and restructuring its manufacturing and business activities in Japan. This enables the company to reduce its annual fixed costs by approximately $130 million per annum.
In February 2016, TowerJazz announced the successful acquisition of an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility in San Antonio, Texas, United States from Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., the consideration, of $40 million was paid by approximately 3.3 million ordinary TowerJazz shares. This acquisition increased TowerJazz's production by 28,000 wafers per month.

Overview[edit]
The company manufactures integrated circuits for semiconductor companies such as: Avago Technologies, Fairchild Semiconductor ,[8] Intel ,[9] International Rectifier, Panasonic, RF Micro Devices, Samsung, Skyworks Solutions, Texas Instruments and Vishay – Siliconix. For global capacity assurance, TowerJazz operates seven manufacturing facilities on three continents: Fab 1 and Fab 2 (150mm and 200mm) located in Migdal Haemek, Israel, Fab 3 and Fab 9 (200mm) located in Newport Beach, California and in San Antonio, Texas and three additional fabs (two 200mm and one 300mm) through TPSCo located in the Hokuriku region of Japan. In addition, TowerJazz operates a worldwide design center in Netanya, Israel.
Tower Semiconductor (TowerJazz) is an Israeli public company that is traded on NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and is included in the TA-100 Index and the TA BlueTech Index. In 2010, TowerJazz became the #1 specialty foundry by revenue, with 70% revenue growth year-over-year.[10]
History[edit]
Tower Semiconductor was founded in 1993, with the acquisition of National Semiconductor’s 150mm wafer fabrication facility. Tower became a public company in 1994 and shares are traded on NASDAQ (TSEM) and Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TSEM). In January 2001, an adjacent, state-of-the-art facility (Fab 2) was constructed.
In September 2008, Tower acquired Jazz Semiconductor in a stock for stock transaction. In November 2009, the combined companies officially launched as TowerJazz. The merger provided several key benefits: increased global capacity, cross-selling opportunities among diverse customer bases of both companies, a more comprehensive product portfolio, and a stronger financial base.
In June 2011, TowerJazz acquired Micron Technology’s fabrication facility in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo, Japan. The acquisition nearly doubled TowerJazz’s 2010 internal manufacturing capacity and cost-effectively increased production by 60,000 wafers per month.
In April 2014, TowerJazz announced the successful transaction with Panasonic Corporation (First Section of TSE and NSE ticker: 6752) to form a newly established Japanese company, TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co. (TPSCo) for the manufacture of Panasonic and additional third party products. TowerJazz announced cessation of its Nishiwaki facility operations in the course of rationalizing and restructuring its manufacturing and business activities in Japan. This enables the company to reduce its annual fixed costs by approximately $130 million per annum.
In February 2016, TowerJazz announced the successful acquisition of an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility in San Antonio, Texas, United States from Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., the consideration, of $40 million was paid by approximately 3.3 million ordinary TowerJazz shares. This acquisition increased TowerJazz's production by 28,000 wafers per month.

Fab 1[edit]
Fab 1, located in Migdal Haemek, Israel is a 150mm facility which was acquired from National Semiconductor in 1993 at the time of Tower Semiconductor’s founding. Since that time, Fab 1 has been significantly modernized and offers process geometries ranging from 1.0-micron to 0.35-micron including CMOS image sensors, embedded flash and mixed-signal technologies.
Fab 2[edit]
Fab 2, a 200mm facility was constructed in January 2001, adjacent to Fab 1 in Migdal Haemek, Israel and was designed to operate in geometries of 0.18-micron and below, using advanced CMOS technology.
Fab 3[edit]
Fab 3, located in Newport Beach, California, USA was acquired by Tower when it merged with Jazz Technologies in 2008. Jazz Semiconductor was formed in 2002 and inherited the 200mm facility that was once operated by Rockwell Semiconductor. At Fab 3, Jazz established industry leading SiGe, BiCMOS and MEMS technologies and expanded upon its heritage for on-shore, specialized foundry services focused on the Aerospace and Defense industry.
Additional three fabs through TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co. (TPSCo)[edit]
TPSCo is 51% owned by Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ: TSEM, TASE: TSEM) and 49% owned by Panasonic Corporation (NASDAQ ADS: PCRFY, TYO: 6752). TPSCo has three manufacturing facilities in Hokuriku, Japan (Uozu, Tonami, and Arai) which have been producing large scale integrated circuits for over 30 years. Areas of process technology focus include high dynamic range image sensors (CIS and CCD), integrated power devices (BCD, SOI and LDMOS) and high frequency silicon RFCMOS. TPSCo offers both IDMs and fabless companies over 120 qualified silicon process flows on 200mm and 300mm substrates from super micron to 45 nm, as well as internal back end processing, assembly and test services.
