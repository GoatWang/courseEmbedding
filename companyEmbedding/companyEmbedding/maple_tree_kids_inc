Our principal stockholder has agreed to loan us money (or purchase additional
equity from us) to cover the costs for the legal and professional fees
associated with this equity offering and the public company reporting expenses
if we raise less than $25,000 in this offering so that in such instance the
proceeds of the offering would not be used to cover these expenses.

Except for fixed costs, the amounts actually spent by us for any specific
purpose may vary and will depend on a number of factors. Non-fixed costs and
general and administrative costs may vary depending on the business progress and
development efforts, general business conditions and market reception to our
products. Notwithstanding the foregoing expectations, our president will have
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending
the corporate uses noted above, we expect to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in cash, cash-equivalents, money market funds, or short-term
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.


We operate in the infant and toddler products industry and we specialize in 
the personalized baby and toddler products. We face competition from many 
websites that provide products and services that are similar to ours. We are
an enterprise with no competitive position within the personalized baby and
toddler products marketplace. We are trying to attract customers to our 
website by placing advertisements and offering promotions on various baby 
weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and available
to the public. We also rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source
of traffic to our website.


Company Description
We are a web-based retailer of children’s clothing, accessories and other
personalized gifts for children. We currently sell products through our website
www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets and hold no
inventory. We are in the process of rebranding our current business


 name
“polkadotpatch” to the name “Maple Tree Kids”, with a goal of selling more
personalized children products and expanding product customization choices to
customers. We work with customers to personalize their gift selections to their
specifications by placing a child’s name, favorite colors and theme or picture
design on the items they order to provide them and their children or others with
a “you are special” experience.

We are currently devoting a substantial amount of our efforts in marketing more
of our suppliers’ offerings of personalized children products. We are working on
creating a new company logo, marketing and sales collateral, searching for sales
personnel to sell more personalized children products through our current
website and building our new website, www.mapletreekids.com, which is currently
under construction. These corporate development efforts to rebrand our company
by selling more personalized children’s products to our current and future
customers, through our new website and name “Maple Tree Kids”.

We have sold our suppliers products to approximately 4,200 customers since our
inception, including our largest customer, a credit union that buys gifts for
their customers when they have a newborn child, whom presently constitutes
approximately 80% of our current business. We have approximately 35 wholesale
suppliers that we can acquire products from, all based in the United States.
During the period from the date of our inception - August 12, 2005 to December
31, 2014, we sold a total of $765,819 of products. Our product sales to date of
personalized children products have not been significant. We generated net
income of $49,868 from our inception date to December 31, 2014. For the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we sold a total of $13,985 and $15,743,
respectively, worth of our products and generated net (loss) of $(13,475) and
$(9,149), respectively.

We do not manufacture any of our own products and do not keep any inventory of
products. We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with our
suppliers. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from our
suppliers once we order the products from them. Once we receive an order from
our customers we instruct our suppliers to drop-ship the purchased inventory
directly to our customers. We require our customers to pre-pay for products
purchased on our websites. The customer authorizes us to charge their credit
card at the time of purchase with the understanding their credit card will be
charged upon shipment.
---

We were incorporated on August 14, 2013 in the State of Nevada. Our corporate
name is Maple Tree Kids, Inc.

Our principal office is located at 119 Rockland Center, Suite 75, Nanuet, NY
10954. Our telephone number: (845) 548-0888. We currently sell products through 
our website www.polkadotpatch.com.

	Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements




	 


	In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. We cannot give any guarantee that the plans, intentions or expectations described in the forward looking statements will be achieved. All forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those factors described in the below Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report that was filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission on February 16, 2016. Readers should carefully review such risk factors as well as factors described in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “guidance,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “projects,” “potential,” “proposed,” “intended,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other “forward-looking” information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in our risk factors and other disclosures could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, and levels of activity, performance or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, without limitation:


	 










	·





	our goals and strategies;





	 










	·





	our future business development, financial condition and results of operations;





	 










	·





	our ability to continue to receive orders from our major customer;





	 










	·





	our expectations regarding demand for our products;





	 










	·





	our ability to diversify our product base





	 










	·





	our ability to diversify our mediums of distribution of our products





	 










	·





	our ability to identify and acquire new customers





	 










	·





	our ability to effectively advertise and promote our products; and





	 










	·





	general economic and business conditions in the United States.





	 


	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinions only as of the date thereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision of our forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

	 Notes to Condensed Financial Statements





	September 30, 2016




	(Unaudited)



	 



	Note 1 – Presentation, Description of Business, Merger and Going Concern



	 


	The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to such rules and regulations and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.


	 


	In the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the three and nine month periods have been made. Results for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year. When used in these notes, the terms "Company,” "we,” "us" or "our" mean Maple Tree Kids, Inc.


	 


	Maple Tree Kids Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated on August 14, 2013 in the State of Nevada. At the time of our incorporation, our president and sole stockholder subscribed for and purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000. The Company is a retail distribution company selling all of its products over the internet in the United States, operating in the infant and toddler products business market. The Company’s products consist of personalized infant and toddler clothing, toys, towels, wash clothes, bibs, disposable products, blankets, baby wraps and slings, wet bags and other accessories. 


	 


	Predecessor Business - Maple Tree Kids LLC:


	 


	Maple Tree Kids LLC a Vermont Limited Liability Company was formed on August 12, 2005 under State of Vermont statutes. Under the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement (“operating agreement”), the term of the Company expires on certain events of dissolution. The Company had one member at who owned 100% of Maple Tree Kids LLC.


	 


	Sale of Member’s LLC Interest:


	 


	On August 16, 2013, the former single member of Maple Tree Kids LLC sold 100% of her interest in the Company to our president and sole stockholder for $8,800. All cash, inventory and equipment were distributed to the prior member at the closing and the URL websites, customer list and vendor list were retained by the Company and the new sole member. The prior member assumed all liabilities of the Company at closing.


	 


	Merger Agreement


	 


	On September 26, 2013 the Company, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, merged into Maple Tree Kids, Inc, a Nevada corporation and ceased to exist as a Vermont LLC as of the date of this merger. Our principal shareholder, who was the sole member of Maple Tree Kids LLC at the time of the merger, received 1 million shares of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. pursuant to the plan of merger, resulting in her owning a total of 2 million shares of Maple Tree Kids, Inc after the merger and continuing to be the sole shareholder of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. Maple Tree Kids, Inc. had assets consisting of cash of $1,000 and stockholders’ equity of $1,000 with no revenue or expenses incurred since its date of incorporation to the time of this merger.

	Financial Reporting – Reorganization


	 


	For financial reporting purposes, this merger transaction was recorded as a reorganization of Maple Tree Kids LLC whereby Maple Tree Kids LLC is deemed to be the continuing, surviving entity for accounting purposes, but through this merger, has deemed to have adopted the capital structure and now operates under the name of Maple Tree Kids, Inc., who became the surviving entity for legal purposes. Accordingly, all references to the former member’s initial capital contribution in Maple Tree Kids LLC been restated to reflect the equivalent number of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. common shares outstanding at the merger date and subsequent capital contributions and capital withdrawals from Maple Tree Kids LLC have been recorded as changes to additional paid-in capital. In other words, the $3,075 of the initial capital contribution made to Maple Tree Kids LLC by the former member of the LLC at August 12, 2005 (date of inception of Maple Tree Kids LLC) has been restated to 2,000,000 common shares outstanding at the par value of $.001 or $2,000 and the remaining $1,075 capital contributed recorded as additional paid-in capital, as of August 12, 2005. Subsequent member capital contributions and withdrawals made from member’s equity have been recorded as increases and decreases to additional paid-in capital.


	 


	The Company’s business activities are focused on developing a market for selling personalized children products and rebranding its name to “Maple Tree Kids”, for selling these personalized baby and toddler products and other products to customers through its new website that is currently under construction, mapletreekids.com. Its current business activities include working with new vendors to bring to market more personalized baby products. The Company will be attracting customers to its websites by viral marketing, including placing advertisements and offering promotions on various baby weblogs or “blogs”, online journals that are updated frequently and postings to other online communities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in distributing personalized baby products through its Maple Tree Kids website into the retail market.


	 


	Sales of the Company’s products are made to retail consumers. The Company buys all of its products from various manufacturers located in the United States and all products are marketed and sold under these manufacturers’ trademarks. The Company presently sells all of its products over the internet through its website, polkadotpatch.com.


	 


	The Company’s product sales into the infant and toddler retail market are subject to numerous contingencies, some of which are beyond management’s control. These contingencies include general and regional economic conditions, prices for the Company’s products, competition, and changes in regulation, various additional political, economic, and other uncertainties.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The Company generated a net loss of $21,811 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and expects to generate losses over the next 12 months, due to an anticipated increase in its general and administrative expenses due to the above mentioned business activities and not having sufficient cash to fund its current and future operations. Therefore there is no assurance that future operations will result in any profit. If the Company cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably in 2016, the Company may need to cease its operations in 2016. If the business operations expand, operating expenses will increase and the profit margins may not be able to cover this increase, and as a result the Company may not be able to develop into a profitable business in the future.


	 


	Management’s plans for the Company include raising additional capital through either debt or equity issuances. Management estimates the minimum amount of additional funding necessary to enable the Company to remain viable and continue its operations for at least the twelve months following the date of the financial statements is approximately $20,000. In September 2014 and October 2014 we raised $22,170 in our registered offering. This registered offering was closed on November 7, 2014. We also obtained a total of $21,580 and $12,000 of shareholder advances during the nine months September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total balance due to this principal shareholder was $47,958 and $26,378 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.


	 


	No assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts to raise additional capital from present or future shareholders or from its principal shareholder. The failure to raise additional capital needed to achieve its business plans will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management's plans, due to the lack of sufficient financial resources and the continuing negative operating results for the Company, include securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in these efforts.

	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Fiscal Year:

	The Company's fiscal year ends December 31. 


	 



	Cash and Cash equivalents

	: We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.


	 



	Use of Estimates:

	 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. There were no significant estimates at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

	The book values of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs).


	 


	The hierarchy consists of three levels: 


	 







	 





	·





	Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;





	 


	 


	 





	 





	·





	Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and





	 


	 


	 





	 





	·





	Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.





	 


	Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.


	 



	Segments and Related Information:

	The Company operates primarily in one principal business segment, infant and toddler products. 


	 



	Amortization of Website:

	The accompanying balance sheet reflects our websites at cost less accumulated amortization. The estimated useful life is 5 years and these websites were developed in 2005 and amortized using the straight line method over its useful life. Our website is www.polkadotpatch.com. The cost and accumulated amortization of the websites for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 were both $5,535 as these websites were fully amortized at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 



	Revenue Recognition:

	Sales to consumers are recorded when the price is fixed or determinable and goods are shipped to the customers. Sales are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of income. Allowances for returns are estimated based on historical customer return rates. Customers pre-pay for orders through our website with their credit cards prior to the shipment of the goods, which takes place within a few days after the order is placed. The Company does not carry inventory and all orders are drop-shipped by our vendors and shipped directly by them to our customers.


	 


	The Company evaluates the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-45,

	Revenue Recognition—Principal Agent Considerations

	, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If the Company is not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, the Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned. The Company records revenue as a principal pursuant to above mentioned factors establishing that the revenue be recorded as a principal.

	Allowances Against Accounts Receivable: 

	The Company did not have any accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company will record allowances against accounts receivable based upon contractually agreed-upon deductions for items such as customer returns. These deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity and historical product returns. All such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales. The Company gives all its customers a 14 day product return policy on all sales; the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer’s account balance. After 14 days there are no returns but the Company may issue an optional store credit to the customer for up to 25% of the sale amount. There are no returns for sales of products that are personalized for its customers. The Company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels. There was no sales returns allowance recorded at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The historical sales return rate for the Company in relation to its total sales have not been significant.


	 



	Income Taxes

	: Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized. We did not provide any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit for any periods presented to date because we have continued to experience a net operating loss since inception and therefore provide a 100% valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets.


	 


	The Company adopted the FASB ASC accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in the FASB ASC Topic “Income Taxes”. This guidance prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. This guidance also provides accounting guidance on derecognizing, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in 2015 or 2014.


	 



	Earnings Per Share:

	Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. The merger with Maple Tree Kids LLC took place on September 26, 2013 and prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in the capitalization of the Company at the merger date.


	 



	Advertising Costs:

	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $- and $- respectively. These expenses, when incurred, are recorded under general and administrative expenses.


	 



	Shipping and Handling Fees Charged to Customers and Reported as Revenue:

	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified on the Statements of Income under the caption selling, general and administrative expenses. 


	 



	Gift Cards:

	The Company will collect the proceeds from gift cards issued and record a liability for the full amount sold. This liability will be reduced when the Company honors redemptions of the gift cards as a form of tender. As a result, the Company will maintain a liability equivalent to 100% of the proceeds from unredeemed gift cards, less estimated unredeemed gift cards. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no significant gift cards sales, therefore the “unredeemed gift certificates” liability was $0 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 


	In recognizing the unredeemed gift card income above, the Company considered the guidance under ASC 405-20-40, Liabilities-Extinguishments of Liabilities-Derecognition paragraph 40-1 that states “A debtor shall derecognize a liability if and only if it has been extinguished. A liability under this standard has been extinguished if either of the following conditions is met: (a) the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or (b) the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability either judicially or by the creditor.” The recognition of unredeemed gift card income is not expected to be material in future reporting periods. If we have future sales of gift cards, we will review historical gift card redemption information at each reporting period to assess the continued appropriateness of the gift card breakage rates and pattern of redemption.

	Contingencies:

	Certain conditions may exist which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.


	 


	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.


	 


	Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they arise from guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.


	 




	Recently-Issued Accounting Standards:




	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Entities can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.


	 


	ASU 2014-15 – “Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern—Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”).” In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 requiring management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, starting December 15, 2016; the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2016.


	 



	Note 3 – Major Customer



	 


	The Company has one major customer, which represents approximately 83% and 80% of total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and approximately 79% and 80% of total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions of Operations.




	 



	The following management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements.



	 



	Overview



	 


	We are a web-based retailer of clothing, accessories and other personalized gifts for children. We currently sell our products through our website www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets. We are in the process of rebranding our business under the name Maple Tree Kids. We are devoting a substantial amount of our efforts promoting our personalized children products, creating a new logo, marketing and sales collateral, and creating a new website, www.mapletreekids.com.


	 


	We acquire our products from approximately 35 wholesale vendors all located in the United States who will also drop-ship the inventory we purchase from them to our customers. We do not manufacture any of our own products. We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from these vendors upon delivery. If the prices charged by these vendors increase and we are not able to pass on the increased price to our customers, then our margins will be reduced and this will affect our potential for future profitability.


	 


	Principal Factors Affecting our Financial Performance


	 


	Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:


	 










	·





	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months.










	 









	·





	Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:










	 









	·





	Our ability to develop and continually update our websites;










	 









	·





	Our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties from whom we acquire inventory;










	 









	·





	Our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products;










	 









	·





	Our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products; and










	 









	·





	Our ability to manage our costs and maintain low overhead.










	 






	 





	·





	Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our Maple Tree Kids website to sell personalized children products that will be located at www.mapletreekids.com and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues.

	·





	We are dependent upon our relationship with our major customer. This customer accounted for approximately 73% and 80%, of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time. If we fail to maintain this relationship, our sales will be significantly diminished. Any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.










	 









	·





	Our sales are dependent on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on cost-effective terms. Our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing, the practice of placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated baby weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public, postings on online communities such as Facebook, MySpace, Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth; search engine optimization, marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results; and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. We expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website, with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources.





	  



	Results of Operations for the


	three months


	and nine months ended


	September 30, 2016 and 2015



	 


	Revenues


	 


	Our revenue was $2,101 and $2,504 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $5,982 and $8,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease in revenue in 2016 is due to a decrease in the volume of items sold through our current website to our major customer and other customers.


	 


	Our ability to generate a significant level of revenues, however, is very uncertain. We continue to be devoting substantially all of our efforts to rebranding our company under the name Maple Tree Kids to sell more personalized children products to the market and creating related marketing and sales collateral, a new logo and new website among other things.


	 


	Cost of Sales


	 


	Our cost of sales was $1,417 and $1,748 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $4,052 and $5,450 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the cost of sales for 2016 was due to our decrease in revenue in 2016 as we sold less merchandise to our major customer and fewer retail customers in 2016.


	 


	Gross Profit


	 


	We generated gross profit of $684 and $756 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $1,930 and $3,153 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the decrease in revenue in 2016 versus 2015.


	 


	Operating Expenses


	 


	Our operating expenses were $3,882 and $3,106 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $23,741 and $36,951 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in our operating expenses in 2016 was due primarily to the decrease in expenses related to our public company listing.


	 


	Net Loss


	 


	Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,198 and $2,350, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $21,811 and $33,798, respectively. The decrease in net loss in 2016 was due to the reasons stated above.

	Impact of Potential Loss of our Major Customer on our Liquidity



	 


	Currently sales to our major customer constitute approximately 73% and 80% of our total revenue for the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015, respectively and revenue from them has decreased from prior periods. Any further decrease in selling our products to them will substantially affect our future operating results and future liquidity. Although we currently have a satisfactory relationship with our major customer, if they were to terminate their relationship or stop ordering products from us, these events would currently result in a loss of substantially all of our revenue which would have a material impact on the liquidity and future of our Company. It is uncertain how long our major customer will continue to order products from us as we do not have any assurances from them as to how long they will continue ordering products from us. We do not have an exclusive agreement with them for selling our type of products to them.


	 


	In the event that the Company is not able to retain our major customer or obtain new customers, we will incur increased operating losses and we will need to raise additional capital to maintain our current operations or cease operations. We presently do not have sufficient working capital to advertise in order to increase our web-based sales by attracting new customers to our websites. We are not presently negotiating any agreements with any new customers.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $1,775, total assets of $1,775 and working capital (deficits) of $(46,794) compared to $1,983 in cash, $1,983 in total assets and $(24,983) in working capital (deficits) as of December 31, 2015.


	 


	The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Report:

	Operating Activities



	 


	Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of net loss as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $21,788, which consisted of a net loss of $21,811 and an increase in working capital of $23. The increase in working capital was due to an increase in accrued liabilities of $23. The decrease in our net loss in 2016 was related to the decrease in our operating expenses, as explained above.


	  


	Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of net loss as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $34,830, which consisted of a net loss of $33,798 and a decrease in working capital of $1,032. The decrease in working capital was due to decrease in accrued liabilities of $1,032.

	Investing Activities



	 


	During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we had no investing activities.


	 



	Financing Activities



	 


	During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $21,580 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $12,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in cash provided by financing activities is due to an increase in shareholder loan payable of $21,580.


	 


	During the year ending December 31, 2016, our total cash requirements will exceed our cash balances. Currently, we do not have sufficient cash in our bank accounts to cover our estimated expenses for the next 12 months. Our current average monthly negative cash flow is approximately $2,000 per month. Based on our current cash position at September 30, 2016 we do not have enough cash on hand to fund our current operations. We anticipate meeting our future cash requirements through either equity financing or debt financing from our principal shareholder to fund the operating costs and the costs of being a public reporting company. Although we anticipate meeting our future cash requirements though, among other things, debt financing from our principal shareholder, we do not currently have any agreements with our principal shareholder to provide such financing, written or unwritten.


	 


	We estimate that our operating expenses, based on us being able to raise the necessary equity capital and executing on our business plan, will be approximately $100,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources.

	We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through either equity financing, continued debt financing from our major shareholder or securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in these efforts.


	 


	We currently do not have any agreements in place for the completion of any equity financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further equity financings or raising any capital. There is no assurance that any financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. We may not raise sufficient funds to fully carry out our business plan. Management's plans, due to the lack of sufficient financial resources and the continuing negative operating results, include securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in these efforts.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	As of the date of this report, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.


	 



	Inflation



	 


	The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete listing of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management.


	 


	Revenue Recognition


	 


	Sales to consumers are recorded when goods are shipped and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of operations. The customer authorizes us to charge their credit card at the time of purchase with the understanding their credit card will be charged upon shipment. We recognize revenue based on the below three criteria. Our policy is to allow the return of any unused merchandise purchased from us for any reason for a 15-day period after the date of sale.


	 



	Delivery has occurred

	. We have our vendors drop ship inventory to our customers and we recognize revenue when we are notified that shipment has occurred.


	 



	Fee is fixed or determinable

	. The price is deemed to be fixed and determinable based on our successful collection history and our arrangement with our customers.


	 



	Collectability is reasonably assured

	. We determine for all of our customers whether collectability is reasonably assured pursuant to our credit review policy. All credit card payments are approved and processed through our website.


	 


	We evaluate the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition—Principal Agent Considerations, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, according to this accounting principle, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned.


	 


	Based on the above facts, we recognize all revenue as a Principal, not an agent.

	Use of Estimates


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 


	Recent Accounting Pronouncements


	 


	Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to our condensed financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.



	 






	Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.




	 


	Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a “smaller reporting company.”



	 






	Item 4. Controls And Procedures.




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	As required by Rule 13a-15(e), our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of Ms. Irina Goldman, our President and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2016. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, Ms. Irina Goldman determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	OTHER INFORMATION




	 






	Item 1. Legal Proceedings




	 


	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

	As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item 1A.

PART I
– FINANCIAL INFORMATION

 

Special
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements

 

In
addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. We cannot
give any guarantee that the plans, intentions or expectations
described in the forward looking statements will be achieved. All
forward-looking statements involve significant risks and
uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors, including those factors described in the below Risk
Factors” section of our Annual Report that was filed with the
Securities & Exchange Commission on February 16, 2016. Readers
should carefully review such risk factors as well as factors
described in other documents that we file from time to time with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology
such as “guidance,” “may,”
“will,” “should,” “expects,”
“plans,” “anticipates,”
“believes,” “estimates,”
“predicts,” “projects,”
“potential,” “proposed,”
“intended,” or “continue” or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read
statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss
our expectations about our future operating results or our future
financial condition or state other “forward-looking”
information. There may be events in the future that we are not able
to accurately predict or control. You should be aware that the
occurrence of any of the events described in our risk factors and
other disclosures could substantially harm our business, results of
operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of
any of these events, the trading price of our securities could
decline. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, growth rates, and levels of activity, performance
or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results, our
performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ
materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking
statements include, without limitation:

 

 




 



·



our goals
and strategies;




 

 

 




 



·



our future
business development, financial condition and results of
operations;




 

 

 




 



·



our
ability to continue to receive orders from our major
customer;




 

 

 




 



·



our
expectations regarding demand for our products;




 

 

 




 



·



our
ability to diversify our product base




 

 

 




 



·



our
ability to diversify our mediums of distribution of our
products




 

 

 




 



·



our
ability to identify and acquire new customers




 

 

 




 



·



our
ability to effectively advertise and promote our products;
and




 

 

 




 



·



general
economic and business conditions in the United States.




 

 

Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements, which reflect management’s opinions only as of
the date thereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly
release the results of any revision of our forward-looking
statements, except as required by law.

MAPLE TREE
KIDS, INC.


 Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements

September
30, 2016

(Unaudited)

 

Note 1
– Presentation, Description of Business, Merger and Going
Concern

 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Maple Tree
Kids, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC,
including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America have been
condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to such rules
and regulations and, accordingly, they do not include all the
information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.

 

In the
opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which
are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the three and nine month periods have been made.
Results for the interim period presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results that might be expected for the entire
fiscal year. When used in these notes, the terms "Company,”
"we,” "us" or "our" mean Maple Tree Kids, Inc.

 

Maple Tree
Kids Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated on August
14, 2013 in the State of Nevada. At the time of our incorporation,
our president and sole stockholder subscribed for and purchased
1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.001
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000. The Company is
a retail distribution company selling all of its products over the
internet in the United States, operating in the infant and toddler
products business market. The Company’s products consist of
personalized infant and toddler clothing, toys, towels, wash
clothes, bibs, disposable products, blankets, baby wraps and
slings, wet bags and other accessories. 

 

Predecessor
Business - Maple Tree Kids LLC:

 

Maple Tree
Kids LLC a Vermont Limited Liability Company was formed on August
12, 2005 under State of Vermont statutes. Under the terms of the
LLC Operating Agreement (“operating agreement”), the
term of the Company expires on certain events of dissolution. The
Company had one member at who owned 100% of Maple Tree Kids
LLC.

 

Sale of
Member’s LLC Interest:

 

On August
16, 2013, the former single member of Maple Tree Kids LLC sold 100%
of her interest in the Company to our president and sole
stockholder for $8,800. All cash, inventory and equipment were
distributed to the prior member at the closing and the URL
websites, customer list and vendor list were retained by the
Company and the new sole member. The prior member assumed all
liabilities of the Company at closing.

 

Merger
Agreement

 

On
September 26, 2013 the Company, pursuant to an agreement and plan
of merger, merged into Maple Tree Kids, Inc, a Nevada corporation
and ceased to exist as a Vermont LLC as of the date of this merger.
Our principal shareholder, who was the sole member of Maple Tree
Kids LLC at the time of the merger, received 1 million shares of
Maple Tree Kids, Inc. pursuant to the plan of merger, resulting in
her owning a total of 2 million shares of Maple Tree Kids, Inc
after the merger and continuing to be the sole shareholder of Maple
Tree Kids, Inc. Maple Tree Kids, Inc. had assets consisting of cash
of $1,000 and stockholders’ equity of $1,000 with no revenue
or expenses incurred since its date of incorporation to the time of
this merger.

Financial
Reporting – Reorganization

 

For
financial reporting purposes, this merger transaction was recorded
as a reorganization of Maple Tree Kids LLC whereby Maple Tree Kids
LLC is deemed to be the continuing, surviving entity for accounting
purposes, but through this merger, has deemed to have adopted the
capital structure and now operates under the name of Maple Tree
Kids, Inc., who became the surviving entity for legal purposes.
Accordingly, all references to the former member’s initial
capital contribution in Maple Tree Kids LLC been restated to
reflect the equivalent number of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. common
shares outstanding at the merger date and subsequent capital
contributions and capital withdrawals from Maple Tree Kids LLC have
been recorded as changes to additional paid-in capital. In other
words, the $3,075 of the initial capital contribution made to Maple
Tree Kids LLC by the former member of the LLC at August 12, 2005
(date of inception of Maple Tree Kids LLC) has been restated to
2,000,000 common shares outstanding at the par value of $.001 or
$2,000 and the remaining $1,075 capital contributed recorded as
additional paid-in capital, as of August 12, 2005. Subsequent
member capital contributions and withdrawals made from
member’s equity have been recorded as increases and decreases
to additional paid-in capital.

 

The
Company’s business activities are focused on developing a
market for selling personalized children products and rebranding
its name to “Maple Tree Kids”, for selling these
personalized baby and toddler products and other products to
customers through its new website that is currently under
construction, mapletreekids.com. Its current business activities
include working with new vendors to bring to market more
personalized baby products. The Company will be attracting
customers to its websites by viral marketing, including placing
advertisements and offering promotions on various baby weblogs or
“blogs”, online journals that are updated frequently
and postings to other online communities. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful in distributing personalized
baby products through its Maple Tree Kids website into the retail
market.

 

Sales of
the Company’s products are made to retail consumers. The
Company buys all of its products from various manufacturers located
in the United States and all products are marketed and sold under
these manufacturers’ trademarks. The Company presently sells
all of its products over the internet through its website,
polkadotpatch.com.

 

The
Company’s product sales into the infant and toddler retail
market are subject to numerous contingencies, some of which are
beyond management’s control. These contingencies include
general and regional economic conditions, prices for the
Company’s products, competition, and changes in regulation,
various additional political, economic, and other
uncertainties.

 

Going
Concern

 

The
Company generated a net loss of $21,811 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and expects to generate losses over the next 12
months, due to an anticipated increase in its general and
administrative expenses due to the above mentioned business
activities and not having sufficient cash to fund its current and
future operations. Therefore there is no assurance that future
operations will result in any profit. If the Company cannot
generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably in 2016, the
Company may need to cease its operations in 2016. If the business
operations expand, operating expenses will increase and the profit
margins may not be able to cover this increase, and as a result the
Company may not be able to develop into a profitable business in
the future.

 

Management’s
plans for the Company include raising additional capital through
either debt or equity issuances. Management estimates the minimum
amount of additional funding necessary to enable the Company to
remain viable and continue its operations for at least the twelve
months following the date of the financial statements is
approximately $20,000. In September 2014 and October 2014 we raised
$22,170 in our registered offering. This registered offering was
closed on November 7, 2014. We also obtained a total of $21,580 and
$12,000 of shareholder advances during the nine months September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total balance due to this
principal shareholder was $47,958 and $26,378 as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

 

No
assurance can be given that management will be successful in its
efforts to raise additional capital from present or future
shareholders or from its principal shareholder. The failure to
raise additional capital needed to achieve its business plans will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, and ability to continue as a going
concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.

 

Management's
plans, due to the lack of sufficient financial resources and the
continuing negative operating results for the Company, include
securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies
to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance
can be given that management will be successful in these
efforts.

Note
2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

 

Fiscal
Year: The
Company's fiscal year ends December 31. 

 

Cash and
Cash equivalents : We
classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of
three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and
all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater
than three months as marketable securities.

 

Use of
Estimates:  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates. There were no significant estimates at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments: The book
values of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable approximate
their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP distinguishes
between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an
entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs).

 

The
hierarchy consists of three levels: 

 

 




 



·



Level
one — Quoted market prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities;





 



 



 





 



·



Level
two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either
directly or indirectly observable; and





 



 



 





 



·



Level
three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates
and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and
reflect those assumptions that a market participant would
use.




 

 

Determining
which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy
requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy
disclosures each quarter.

 

Segments
and Related Information: The
Company operates primarily in one principal business segment,
infant and toddler products. 

 

Amortization
of Website: The
accompanying balance sheet reflects our websites at cost less
accumulated amortization. The estimated useful life is 5 years and
these websites were developed in 2005 and amortized using the
straight line method over its useful life. Our website is
www.polkadotpatch.com. The cost and accumulated amortization
of the websites for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
for the year ended December 31, 2015 were both $5,535 as these
websites were fully amortized at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.

 

Revenue
Recognition: Sales to
consumers are recorded when the price is fixed or determinable and
goods are shipped to the customers. Sales are reported net of
allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying
statements of income. Allowances for returns are estimated based on
historical customer return rates. Customers pre-pay for orders
through our website with their credit cards prior to the shipment
of the goods, which takes place within a few days after the order
is placed. The Company does not carry inventory and all orders are
drop-shipped by our vendors and shipped directly by them to our
customers.

 

The
Company evaluates the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Subtopic
605-45, Revenue Recognition—Principal Agent
Considerations , in determining whether it is appropriate to
record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the
net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is
primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk,
has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or has
several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross.
If the Company is not primarily obligated and amounts earned are
determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a
combination of the two, the Company generally records the net
amounts as commissions earned. The Company records revenue as a
principal pursuant to above mentioned factors establishing that the
revenue be recorded as a principal.

Allowances
Against Accounts Receivable:  The
Company did not have any accounts receivable at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. The Company will record allowances against
accounts receivable based upon contractually agreed-upon deductions
for items such as customer returns. These deductions are recorded
throughout the year commensurate with sales activity and historical
product returns. All such allowances are recorded as direct offsets
to sales. The Company gives all its customers a 14 day product
return policy on all sales; the allowances are reduced to reflect
such payments or credits issued against the customer’s
account balance. After 14 days there are no returns but the Company
may issue an optional store credit to the customer for up to 25% of
the sale amount. There are no returns for sales of products that
are personalized for its customers. The Company analyzes the
components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and
adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels. There was no
sales returns allowance recorded at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. The historical sales return rate for the Company in
relation to its total sales have not been significant.

 

Income
Taxes : Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the
recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized. We did
not provide any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit
for any periods presented to date because we have continued to
experience a net operating loss since inception and therefore
provide a 100% valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax
assets.

 

The
Company adopted the FASB ASC accounting guidance for recognizing
and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in the FASB ASC
Topic “Income Taxes”. This guidance prescribes a
threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the
benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the
financial statements. This guidance also provides accounting
guidance on derecognizing, classification and disclosure of these
uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and
penalties in operating expenses. The Company has not recognized any
interest and pe

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions of Operations.  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements.  Overview  We are a web-based retailer of clothing, accessories and other personalized gifts for children. We currently sell our products through our website www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets. We are in the process of rebranding our business under the name Maple Tree Kids. We are devoting a substantial amount of our efforts promoting our personalized children products, creating a new logo, marketing and sales collateral, and creating a new website, www.mapletreekids.com.  We acquire our products from 35 wholesale vendors all located in the United States who will also drop-ship the inventory we purchase from them to our customers. We do not manufacture any of our own products. We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from these vendors upon delivery. If the prices charged by these vendors increase and we are not able to pass on the increased price to our customers, then our margins will be reduced and this will affect our potential for future profitability.  Principal Factors Affecting our Financial Performance  Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:  � Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months.  � Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:  � Our ability to develop and continually update our websites;  � Our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties from whom we acquire inventory;  � Our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products;  � Our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products; and  � Our ability to manage our costs and maintain low overhead.  � Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our Maple Tree Kids website to sell personalized children products that will be located at www.mapletreekids.com and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues.  � We are dependent upon our relationship with our major customer. This customer accounted for approximately 80%, of our total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. This major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time. If we fail to maintain this relationship, our sales will be significantly diminished. Any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.  � Our sales are dependent on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on cost-effective terms. Our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing, the practice of placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated baby weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public, postings on online communities such as Facebook, MySpace, Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth; search engine optimization, marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results; and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. We expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website, with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources.  Results of Operations for the Three months and Six months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014  Revenues  We generated revenues of $2,679 and $4,084 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $6,099 and $5,771 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease in revenue in 2015 is due to a decrease in the volume of items sold through our current website to our major customer.  Our ability to generate a significant level of revenues, however, is very uncertain. We continue to be devoting substantially all of our efforts to rebranding our company under the name Maple Tree Kids to sell more personalized children products to the market and creating related marketing and sales collateral, a new logo and new website among other things.  Cost of Sales  Our cost of sales was $1,671 and $2,719 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $3,702 and $3,814 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the cost of sales for 2015 was due to our decrease in revenue in 2015 as we sold less merchandise to our major customer and fewer retail customers in 2015.  Gross Profit  We generated gross profit of $1,008 and $1,365 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $2,397 and $1,957 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 was due to the decrease in revenue in 2015 versus 2014.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses were $28,094 and $3,702 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $33,845 and $11,821 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in our operating expenses for the three month periods in 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to the increase in fees in order for our stock to be listed on the OTCQB marketplace stock exchange ($12,500 paid) and dues paid for our stock to be eligible for electronic trading using The Depository Trust Company of $12,000.  Net Loss  Our net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $27,086 and $2,337, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $(31,448) and $(9,864), respectively. The increase in net losses in 2015 was due to the reasons stated above.  Impact of Potential Loss of our Major Customer on our Liquidity  Currently sales to our major customer constitute approximately 80% of our total revenue. Any substantial decrease in selling our products to them will substantially affect our operating results and liquidity. Although we currently have a satisfactory relationship with our major customer, if they were to terminate their relationship or stop ordering products from us, these events would currently result in a loss of substantially all of our revenue which would have a material impact on the liquidity of our Company. It is uncertain how long our major customer will continue to order products from us as we do not have any assurances from them as to how long they will continue ordering products from us. We do not have an exclusive agreement with them for selling our type of products to them.  In the event that the Company is not able to retain our major customer or obtain new customers, we will incur increased operating losses and we will need to raise additional capital to maintain our current operations or cease operations. We presently are seeking to increase our web-based sales by attracting new customers to our websites. We are not presently negotiating any agreements with any new major customers.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2015, we had cash of $4,770, total assets of $4,770 and working capital of $(19,852) compared to $26,693 in cash, $26,693 in total assets and $11,596 in working capital as of December 31, 2014.  The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Report:  Cash Flows Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 Net cash (used in) operating activities $ (21,923 ) (9,797 ) Net cash (used in) investing activities $ - (404 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ - 10,000 Net cash inflow (outflow) $ (21,923 ) (201 )  Operating Activities  Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2015 consisted of net loss as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $21,923, which consisted of a net loss of $31,448 and an decrease in working capital of $9,525. The increase in working capital was due to an increase in accrued liabilities of $9,525.  Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2014 consisted of net loss as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $9,797, which consisted of a net loss of $9,864 and an increase in working capital of $67. The decrease in working capital was due to an increase in accounts receivable of $127, a decrease in inventory of $1,087 and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $893.  Investing Activities  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we had no investing activities.During the six months ended June 30, 2014 we had $404 of investing activities from the purchase of computer equipment and software.  Financing Activities  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $0 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $10,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 a decrease of $10,000 This decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due to a decrease in proceeds from our principal shareholder loans of $10,000  During the year ended December 31, 2015, our total cash requirements may exceed our cash balances. Currently, we do not have sufficient cash in our bank accounts to cover our estimated expenses for the next 12 months. Our projected average monthly negative cash flow is approximately $2,000 per month. Based on our current cash position at June 30, 2015 we do not have enough cash on hand to fund our current operations. We anticipate meeting our future cash requirements through a combination of equity financing from the proceeds of our offering and debt financing from our principal shareholder to fund the costs of this offering and the costs of being a public reporting company. Although we anticipate meeting our future cash requirements though, among other things, debt financing from our principal shareholder, we do not currently have any agreements with our principal shareholder to provide such financing, written or unwritten.  We estimate that our operating expenses, based on us being able to raise the necessary equity capital, will be approximately $100,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources.   Target completion Estimated Description date or period Expenses Legal and accounting fees 12 months $ 25,000 Further development of Maple Tree Kids website December 2015 10,000 Marketing and advertising 12 months 25,000 Salaries and consulting fees 12 months 22,000 General and administrative 12 months 18,000 $ 100,000  We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing. We currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further financings or raising any capital. There is no assurance that any financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. We may not raise sufficient funds to fully carry out any business plan.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of the date of this report, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.  Inflation  The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete listing of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management.  Revenue Recognition  Sales to consumers are recorded when goods are shipped and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of operations. The customer authorizes us to charge their credit card at the time of purchase with the understanding their credit card will be charged upon shipment. We recognize revenue based on the below three criteria. Our policy is to allow the return of any unused merchandise purchased from us for any reason for a 15-day period after the date of sale.  Delivery has occurred. We have our vendors drop ship inventory to our customers and we recognize revenue when we are notified that shipment has occurred.  Fee is fixed or determinable. The price is deemed to be fixed and determinable based on our successful collection history and our arrangement with our customers.  Collectability is reasonably assured. We determine for all of our customers whether collectability is reasonably assured pursuant to our credit review policy. All credit card payments are approved and processed through our website.  We evaluate the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition-Principal Agent Considerations, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, according to this accounting principle, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned.  Based on the above facts, we recognize all revenue as a Principal, not an agent.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Other than Accounting Standards Update 2014-10 that removed the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP, management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

Irina Goldman, the sole director, President, Treasurer, Secretary
and controlling shareholder of the Company. to the stock purchase

Companys common stock, par value $0.001, from Irina Goldman for
$320,000, or $0.0457, per share. The Shares represent
approximately 86.3% of the Companys issued and outstanding common
stock as of the closing. Accordingly, as a result of the

Percentage of Registrant



















Aircom Pacific, Inc.







7,000,000








86.3


%




Aircom used its working capital to acquire the Shares. Aircom did
not borrow any funds to acquire the Shares.


Prior to the Closing, Aircom was not affiliated with the Company.
However, Aircom will be deemed an affiliate of the Company after
the Closing as a result of its stock ownership interest in the
Company.


The foregoing description of the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
provisions of that document filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report
and incorporated by reference herein.


Change of Business Plan


The Company expects to promptly file a notice with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for the approval of a name
change to Aerkomm Inc. and a new ticker symbol as well as a
planned 1 for 10 reverse split of its common stock. The Company
will file an additional Current Report on Form 8-K once FINRA has
approved the planned corporate actions and assigned the Companys
new ticker symbol. Additionally, once these corporate actions are
completed, the Company expects to engage in a share exchange
transaction with the shareholders of Aircom to which the Company
will issue shares of its common stock to the Aircom shareholders
in exchange for all of their Aircom shares, and Aircom will
surrender to the Company for cancellation its 7,000,000 shares of
Company common stock. The Company expects to complete this share
exchange transaction sometime during the first quarter of 2017.
Following the consummation of the share exchange transaction, the
Company expects to discontinue its business of selling infant and
toddler products through the internet and instead solely engage
in the business of providing in-flight entertainment and
connectivity systems to commercial airlines through Aircom, which
will become its wholly-owned subsidiary upon consummation of the
share exchange transaction.

















Except as contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and except
as otherwise expressly described herein, neither Aircom nor the
Company has any other specific plans or proposals at this time
which relate to or would result in:







the acquisition by any person of additional securities of
the Company









an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries;









a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
Company or of any of its subsidiaries;









any material change in the present capitalization or
dividend policy of the Company;









any other material change in the Company’s business or
corporate structure;









changes in the Company’s charter, bylaws or instruments
corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the
acquisition of control of the issuer by any other person;









causing a class of securities of the Company to be delisted
from a national securities exchange or to cease to be
authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system
of a registered national securities association;









a class of equity securities of the Company becoming
eligible for termination of registration to Section
12(g)(4) of the Securities Act; or






any similar action to those enumerated above.




ITEM 5.01 Changes in Control of Registrant.


Reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Item 1.01 of
this report, which disclosure is incorporated herein by
reference. As a result of the closing of stock purchase
transaction, the control of the Company has been transferred from
Irina Goldman to Aircom.


ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers;
Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.


In connection with the closing of the stock purchase transaction,
on December 28, 2016, Irina Goldman, the sole director of the
Company, submitted her resignation letter, to which she resigned
from all offices of the Company that she held effective as of the
closing of the stock purchase transaction. The resignation of Ms.
Goldman was not in connection with any known disagreement with
the Company on any matter.


On December 28, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey Wun was appointed to the board
of the directors, effective as of December 28, 2016. Mr. Wun was
also appointed as the President, Treasurer and Secretary of the
Company. The Company and the newly appointed officer have not
entered into any arrangement regarding the payment of
compensation for acting as an officer or director of the Company.
Mr. Wun is also the Chief Technical Officer of Aircom.


There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Wun and
any other persons to which he was selected as an officer. Mr. Wun
was appointed until his successor is duly elected and qualified.
There has been no transaction, nor is there any currently
proposed transaction between Mr. Wun and the Company, that would
require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

















Mr. Wun is a technologist who has more than 25 years experiences
in the communications industry. Mr. Wun worked at Kairos System
Inc. where he served as CEO from 2003 to 2010. He joined MediaTEK
USA Inc. in November 2010 as professional engineer where he
worked until December 2012. He then joined Samsung Electronics
Co., Ltd. as Senior Staff Engineer in December 2012 where he
worked until May 2015. He joined Aircom Pacific Inc as CTO in May
2015. Mr. Wun received his BS in Biochemistry and Computer
Science from Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1988.


Mr. Wun expects to spend approximately five hours per month on
the Companys business and affairs until the share exchange
transaction described above is consummated. Thereafter, Mr. Wun
will devote his full business time to the affairs of the Company
and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Aircom.


ITEM 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
Holders.


Immediately following closing of the stock purchase transaction
on December 28, 2016, Aircom, as the holder of approximately
86.3% of the total issued and outstanding voting capital stock of
the Company, approved by written consent an amendment of the
Companys Articles of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the
Company to Aerkomm Inc. and (ii) effectuate a 1 for 10 reverse
split of the Companys outstanding common stock. Such approval and
consent constitute the approval and consent of at least a
majority of the total number of shares of the Companys
outstanding common stock and is sufficient under Section78.320 of
the Nevada Revised Statutes, the Companys Articles of
Incorporation and the Companys Bylaws to approve such amendments.
As noted above, the Company expects to promptly file a notice
with FINRA for the approval such amendments. Upon such approval,
the Company will file a Certificate of Amendment with the
Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effectuate such
amendments.

addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. We cannot give any guarantee that the plans, intentions or expectations described in the forward looking statements will be achieved. All forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those factors described in the below "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report.

ability to diversify our product base� �our ability to diversify our mediums of distribution of our products� �our ability to identify and acquire new customers� �our
ability to effectively advertise and promote our products; and� �general economic and business conditions in the United States.�Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of the date thereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision of our forward-looking statements, except as required by law.� �3��PART
I�ITEM 1. BUSINESS.�Overview�We are a web-based retailer of children's clothing, accessories and other personalized gifts for children. We currently sell products through our website www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets and hold no inventory. We are in the process of rebranding our current business name "polkadotpatch" to the name "Maple Tree Kids", with a goal of selling more personalized children products and expanding product customization choices to customers. We work with customers to personalize their gift selections to their specifications by placing a child's name, favorite colors and theme or picture design
on the items they order to provide them and their children or others with a "you are special" experience.�We are currently devoting a substantial amount of our efforts in marketing more of our suppliers' offerings of personalized children products. We are working on creating a new company logo, marketing and sales collateral, searching for sales personnel to sell more personalized children products through our current website and building our new website, www.mapletreekids.com, which is currently under construction. These corporate development efforts to rebrand our
company by selling more personalized children's products to our current and future customers, through our new website and name "Maple Tree Kids".
�Management's plans, due to the lack of�sufficient financial resources for the Company, may include securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts.�We have sold our suppliers products to approximately 4,200 customers since our inception, including our largest customer, a large credit union bank that buys gifts for their customers when they have a newborn child, whom presently constitutes approximately 80% of our current business. We have approximately 35 wholesale suppliers that we can acquire products from, all based in the United States. During the period from the date of our inception
- August 12, 2005 to December 31, 2015, we sold a total of $775,871 of products. Our product sales to date of personalized children products have not been significant. We generated net income of $13,289 from our inception date to December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we sold a total of $10,052 and $13,985, respectively, worth of our products and generated net losses of $36,579 and $13,475, respectively.�We do not manufacture any of our own products and did not keep any inventory of products in 2015. We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with our suppliers. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from our suppliers once we order the
products from them. Once we receive an order from our customers we instruct our suppliers to drop-ship the purchased inventory directly to our customers. We require our customers to pre-pay for products purchased on our websites. The customer authorizes us to charge their credit card at the time of purchase with the understanding their credit card will be charged upon shipment and title will pass the customer upon shipment.��In September 2014 and October 2014 the Company sold in its registered public offering to 39 retail investors 1,108,500 shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $22,170. The purchase price was $0.02 per common share and there were no offering costs paid in this registered offering. This registered public offering was
closed on November 7, 2014.� �4��Company History�We were incorporated on August 14, 2013 in the State of Nevada. Our corporate name is Maple Tree Kids, Inc. At the time of our incorporation, our president and sole stockholder, Irina Goldman, subscribed for and purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.001
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000.�We were incorporated in order to acquire by merger all of the limited liability company interests of Maple Tree Kids LLC, a Vermont limited liability company, or ("MTK LLC"). Our president had personally acquired all of the limited liability company interests of MTK LLC for a total purchase price of $8,800 on August 16, 2013. MTK LLC then merged with and into our company on September 26, 2013 pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the same date. Our company was the
surviving company in the merger and the separate existence of MTK LLC ceased and we succeeded to all of the assets of MTK LLC as a result of the merger. At the effective time of the merger, each limited liability company percentage interest in MTK LLC held by our president was automatically changed and converted into ten thousand shares of our common stock. Since our president owned 100% of the limited liability company interests in MTK LLC at the time of the merger, she received a total of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock as a result of the merger. In addition, on September 26, 2013, our president converted $5,000 of indebtedness that our company owed to her into common shares, at a par value of $0.001, by cancelling such debt in exchange for a total of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement dated
as of such date.�Emerging Growth Company Status�We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have not made a decision whether to take advantage of any or all of these exemptions. If we do take advantage of any of these exemptions, we do not know if
some investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result. The result may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.�In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act.�We could remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed
$1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.�In addition, Section 103 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company is not required to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b). This exemption is available to us as well as a smaller reporting company.�Our Industry�In today's economy, buyers believe that a personalized gift will allow them to make a lasting impression at a reasonable cost. According to the 2013 Gifting Report, the gifting
market - defined as items or experiences purchased to give as a gift - represents more than $1 out of every $10 spent at the general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other, (GAFO), type of store. Americans of all ages love to see their name on a product. The personalized gift market is mainly a U.S. phenomenon, the roots of which can be traced to the early days when the family names or initials would be engraved on silver bowls and jewelry. In the early days personalization was only available to those who could afford it. With the development of new machinery and computerized technologies, personalized gifts that would take weeks to manufacture now can be shipped to the customers almost immediately.�Faith Popcorn, founder of New York based marketing consultancy, Brain Reserve, who is a futurist and studies and reports on nationwide trends, has coined the word "egonomics" to describe the personalized product phenomenon. Ms.
Popcorn and other trend forecasters agree that the personalized gift industry will continue steady growth as more products are brought to market in response to consumer demand.� �5��Buying and shopping for gifts is a big business. Today's gift retailers are expecting an increase in business in 2014 as compared to 2013. According to gift retailers responding to Gift & Decorative Accessories' exclusive Today's Gift Retailer 2014 survey, 75% of gift retailers are projecting 2014 sales to be up or about the same as 2013 sales.�In
2013, 37 percent of manufacturers were focusing on Millennials when developing new products and this year that number has jumped 20 percentage points to 57 percent. Two years ago there was a rise in the percentage of gift manufacturers targeting Younger Boomers, those between the ages of 50 and 58, from 54 percent in 2013 to 57 percent in 2014. This year the percentage of vendors reporting they will target Younger Boomers fell nine percentage points to 48 percent. Sandwiched between the large demographic groups of Baby Boomers and Millennials are Generation Xers, those ages 34 to 49. While its numbers are small, this group remains the number one target for gift manufacturers, with 62 percent reporting they will develop products geared towards this cohort.�According to the data published by First Research in September 2013 US personal consumption expenditures at gift, novelty, and souvenir stores are forecast to grow at an
annual compounded rate of 1 percent between 2013 and 2017.�According to the 2013 Gifts & Decorative Accessories Trends and Forecast Survey, 43% of gift and decorative accessory vendors stated that they plan on creating products targeted at Millennials, also known as Generation Y. The 2010 Census revealed there are 56 million adult Millennials age 18 to 30. According to the survey, Millennials have a purchasing power of $170 billion.�In total, this group is comprised of individuals born between 1981 and 2000, came of age in the new millennium and is considered the second largest age group behind Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. Millennials are known for multi-tasking, short attention spans and a constant need for stimulation. Traditional merchandising is not going to entice this group to make purchases. They need stores and online retailers to have captivating
signage and be willing to engage them through social media. We aim to attract the attention of this group with our personalized products and by offering an individualized approach to their shopping experience.�Competition�We operate in the infant and toddler products industry and we specialize in the personalized baby and toddler products. We face competition from many websites that provide products and services that are similar to ours.�We are an enterprise with no competitive position within the personalized baby and toddler products marketplace. We�were trying to attract customers to our website by placing advertisements and offering promotions on various baby weblogs or "blogs",
online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public. We�now rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website.�Our Competitive Strengths�We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:� ��Existing relationships with wholesale suppliers enabling us to obtain wholesale pricing from many of our vendors;�����Robust
websites that features streamlined navigation;�����Wide selection of children's clothing, including organic and eco-friendly products sourced by our President;�����Existing relationships with vendors/artists able to customize designs based on specific customer requirements creating truly personalized experience for our customers;�����No
storage costs;�����Personalized customer support from our President; and�����Low overhead costs.� �6��Our
Growth Strategy�Our Growth Strategy�We will implement the following strategic plans to take advantage of industry opportunities and our competitive strengths:� ��We plan to develop relationships with more distributors in the U.S. that will help us increase our sales.�����We plan to begin marketing our new
website under construction (www.mapletreekids.com) and our product offerings on the Internet and through other marketing channels.�����We plan to leverage the social network of our President to find new sales opportunities.�����We plan to further diversify our product portfolio, including personalized children
clothing and accessories, to satisfy a larger array of customer preferences.�Our Products�Products�We sell, at retail, a variety of infant and toddler products including:� ��infant and toddler clothing,�����toys,�����towels,�����backpacks,�����gift
baskets,�����infant and toddler holiday items,�����children's room decorative items,�����blankets,�����baby
wraps and slings,�����gifts for mothers, and�����infant and toddler accessories.� �7��We
maintain over 500 product items in our supply chain and periodically review, add and drop products based upon the demand in the marketplace and product availability.�We have never experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining quality merchandise in adequate volumes and at suitable prices.�We currently secure our merchandise mostly on a purchase order basis from various wholesale suppliers with whom we have established relationships. We plan to maintain and foster such relationships and to establish and foster new relationships with additional wholesale suppliers. We expect to meet new suppliers through word of mouth introductions, trade shows, and through searches on the Internet.�Payments are generally made to suppliers by credit card and, if possible, drop shipped per our request to customers who themselves have provided us their credit card information. In this
way, we are trying to limit the amount of inventory we need to carry. In cases where products are drop shipped, our clients cover shipping costs.�We currently work with approximately 35 different suppliers. We do not believe that any individual supplier is material to our business, since there are a number of alternative suppliers available to supply products to us.�Distribution Methods�We sell directly over the internet though our websites.�We may develop relationships with distributors in the U.S. and internationally that will help us increase our domestic and international sales.�Intellectual Property�We own our domain names, mapletreekids.com, polkadotpatch.com
and www.sunshinepolkadots.com. but do not have any trademarks or trade names or any other significant intellectual property.�Regulation�We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. In addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. We face risks from some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future.�In the US, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number
of claims, which include actions for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content generated by users. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. Any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.�A range of other laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing, linking or hosting third-party content that includes materials that infringe copyrights. In the area of data protection, many states
have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.�Employees�We currently have one officer, our President, Irina Goldman. Ms. Goldman is not compensated for the services she provides to the Company at this time, but may be compensated in the future.� �8��ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.�Readers should carefully consider the following factors that may affect our business, future operating results and financial condition, as well as other information included in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones our company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.�RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS�We generate a significant amount of our present revenues from one major customer and if our relationship with this major customer deteriorates in any way, our ability
to generate future revenues consistent with prior revenues may be severely hampered and we may have to wind down our business and cease operations.�One major customer, a federally chartered credit union who buys gifts for each of their customers who have a newborn child, accounted for approximately 80% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. This major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time. It is likely that our competitors will pursue a relationship with this major customer and threaten our business relationship with this major customer. If we fail to maintain this relationship, our sales will be significantly diminished. Any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer would
have a material impact on our operations and financial position.
�We do not have sufficient working capital to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and we are not certain that we will be able to secure the financing we need to meet those requirements. If we do not obtain the financing we need to satisfy our financial requirements, we will have to wind down our business and you may lose your entire investment.�As of December 31, 2015 we had $1,983 of cash. We intend to meet our projected ongoing cash requirements of approximately $100,000 for the next 12 months by utilizing existing working capital and by raising the shortfall through a combination of the proceeds of this offering and of equity and debt financing from either our principal shareholder Irina Goldman, who is also our director, president and principal stockholder.
or other investors, if we are able to identify other investors willing to purchase our securities or loan funds to us. We may not be able to secure financing from other investors and our principal shareholder has not committed through any agreement to provide any additional financing to us. If financing is available, it may involve issuing securities that could be dilutive to holders of our capital stock. If we do not raise additional capital from conventional sources, such as our principal stockholder or new investors or commercial banks, it is likely that our growth will be restricted and we may be forced to scale back or curtail implementing our business plan and our business may fail and you may lose your entire investment. If we borrow money to raise capital or sell debt securities we may become subject to affirmative and negative covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business or impose other restrictions that may affect our financial condition and
growth strategy. Furthermore, if we cannot make required payments of interest or principal on loans that we may obtain or debt securities that we may issue, then the lender or note holder may declare a default that may result in our bankruptcy or a situation where the lender or note holder otherwise takes over our business and your investment would be entirely lost.�Because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is substantial uncertainty we will continue operations in which case you could lose your entire investment.�Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion in their report on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease our operations and you could lose your entire investment.�The Company generated a net loss of $36,579 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and we expect to generate losses into the future as our general and administrative expenses increase as a result of paying professional fees related to becoming a public reporting company as we attempt to raise money to expand our current business. There is no assurance our future operations will result in any profit. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, we will cease operations and you will lose your investment. If our business operations expand and our operating expenses increase, our
profit margins may decrease and we may not be able to develop into a profitable business in the future.� �9��Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:� �our ability
to develop and continually update our website;� �our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties that drop ship our products for us;� �our
ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products;� �our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products; and� �our
ability to keep managing our costs and maintain low overhead.�Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our business and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the future to pay for all our operating expenses. Failure to generate revenues that are greater than our expenses will result in the loss of all or a portion of your investment.�Changing consumer preferences will require periodic new product introduction. If we are unable to continually satisfy new consumer preferences, we may not generate any material level of revenues.�As a result of changing consumer preferences, many Internet websites
are successfully marketed for a limited period of time. Even if our products become popular, there can be no assurance that any of our products will continue to be popular for a sustained period of time. Our success will be dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved product lines. Our failure to introduce new product lines and to achieve and sustain market acceptance could result in us being unable to continually meet consumer preferences and generate any material level of revenues.�We face intense competition now and if we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors we will not be able to achieve profitability.�The children's clothing, accessories and products industry is highly competitive. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, broader product lines and greater financial resources and advertising budgets than we do. Many
of our competitors offer similar products or alternatives to our products. We may not be able to develop a more appealing online website than our competitors and we may not be able to otherwise compete effectively against our competitors.�Further, our competitors may be able to develop their markets more effectively, have significantly more products than us, may be able to sell their products on more favorable terms, and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing than us. They may have longer operating histories, greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. In the event that we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors we will not be able to achieve profitability.�We face a difficult current retail environment
and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending, and as a result, adversely affect our financial condition.�Historically, children's clothing, accessories and related products have been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Such uncertainty, as well as other variations in global economic conditions such as consumer confidence, rising fuel costs and slowing housing starts, may continue to cause inconsistent and unpredictable consumer spending habits. Many industry analysts believe the Internet sale of children's clothing, accessories and related products business segment is a very difficult business segment to operate in successfully. Should consumer demand for our products continue at these current low levels for an extended period of time or deteriorate, it will be difficult to achieve our financial goals and plans.� �10��If
we do not attract customers to our website on cost-effective terms, we will not make a profit, which ultimately will result in a cessation of operations.�Our success depends on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on cost-effective terms. Our strategy to attract customers to our website, includes viral marketing, the practice of generating "buzz" among Internet users in our products through placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated children's and baby weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public, postings on online communities such
as Facebook, MySpace, Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth; search engine optimization, marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results; and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. We expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website,
with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources. Our marketing strategy may not be enough to attract sufficient traffic to our website. If we do not attract customers to our website on cost-effective terms, we will not make a profit, which ultimately will result in a cessation of operations. Additional marketing efforts include participating in promotional events run through Groupon, Bitsy Bug and similar programs, however sufficient additional purchase volume by each individual customer redeeming the coupons is required in order to generate profit.�Our success depends on the continuing efforts of president and the loss of her services could result in a disruption of operations that could
result in reduced revenues.�We have no employees and our future success depends heavily upon the continuing services of our president and principal stockholder, Irina Goldman. If Ms. Goldman is unable or unwilling to continue in her present positions, we may not be able to replace her easily or at all, and our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We do not currently maintain key person insurance on our president. The loss of the services of our president could result in a disruption of operations that could result in reduced revenues.�Because our president owns more than 50% of our outstanding shares, she controls our company and is able to designate
our directors and officers and control all major decisions and corporate actions and so long as our president retains ownership of a majority of our outstanding common stock you will not be able to elect any directors or have a meaningful say in any major decisions or corporate actions which could decrease the price and marketability of our shares.�Our president is the sole officer and director of our company. She owns 7,000,000 shares of our common stock constituting 86% of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this annual report and will own a majority of the common shares outstanding if all shares are sold in this offering. As a result, our president is able to elect all of our directors, appoint all of our officers, control the shareholder vote on any major decision or corporate action and control our operations. Our president can
unilaterally decide major corporate actions such as mergers, acquisitions, future securities offerings, amendments to our charter and bylaws and other significant corporate events. Our president's unilateral control over us could decrease the price and marketability of our shares.�Our business depends on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. Outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services and reduce our revenues.�The success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable
Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic. The Internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth requirements, or problems caused by "viruses," "worms," and similar programs may harm the performance of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services and reduce our revenues.�Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively
provide our products, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.�Our ability to provide our products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could interrupt our service. Service interruptions could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our name if our system is perceived to be unreliable. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of terrorist attacks, war, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, interruptions in access to our websites through the use of "denial of service" or similar attacks, hacking or other attempts to harm our systems, and similar events. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning
does not account for all possible scenarios. The occurrence of a natural disaster or a closure of an internet data center by a third-party provider without adequate notice could result in lengthy service interruptions. Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our products, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.� �11��If our website
contains undetected errors, we could lose the confidence of users, resulting in loss of customers and a reduction of revenue.�Our websites could contain undetected errors or "bugs" that could adversely affect the ability of our customers to order products through our website. The occurrence of errors may cause us to lose market share, damage our reputation and brand name, and reduce our revenues.�If the security measures that we use to protect our user's personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective, our customers may lose their confidence in our websites and stop visiting
it. This may result in a reduction in revenues and increase our operating expenses, which would prevent us from achieving profitability.�We use www.yahoo.com PayPal for our website hosting and security. Any breach in our website security could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. We anticipate that we will rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information. As a result of advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments, a compromise or breach of our security precautions may occur.
A compromise in our proposed security could severely harm our business. A party who is able to circumvent our proposed security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, including customer credit card information, or cause interruptions in the operation of our website. We may be required to spend significant funds and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. However, protection may not be available at a reasonable price, or at all. Concerns regarding the security of e-commerce and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. This may result in a reduction in revenues and increase our operating expenses, which would prevent us from achieving profitability.�As an "Emerging Growth
Company" under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.�We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:� �have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;� �comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);� �submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and� �disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive's compensation to median employee compensation.�In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.�We will remain an "emerging growth company" for
up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.�Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.� �12��RISKS
RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK�Our stock has not been listed on any public exchange, and no prediction can be made as to when, if ever, a public market for our common stock would develop.�To date, there has been no public market for our common stock. No prediction can be made as to when, if ever, a public market for our common stock will develop. There is no liquidity for shares distributed in this offering and investors may have difficulty in selling any shares acquired in the offering at prices they want or at all. If a public market for the common stock does develop at a future time, sales of shares by stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could reduce the prevailing market price and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. The
company is not listed on any public exchange and there are no market makers currently applying to handle the company's stock.�We will likely conduct offerings of our equity securities in the future, in which case your proportionate interest will be diluted.�Since our inception, we have relied on stock sales to our principal stockholder. Even if this equity offering is successful, we will likely be required to undertake additional equity offerings in the future to finance our current business. If common stock is issued in return for additional funds, the price per share could be lower than that you pay in this offering. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. If we issue additional stock, your percentage interest in us will be diluted.�Penny
stock regulations under U.S. federal securities laws may adversely affect the ability of investors to resell their shares.�We anticipate that our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These rules regulate broker-dealer practices for transactions in "penny stocks." Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers that derive more than five percent of their customer transaction revenues from transactions in penny stocks to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks, and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market, to any non-institutional customer to whom the broker-dealer recommends a penny stock transaction. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation
of the broker-dealer and its salesperson and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction, the broker and/or dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. The transaction costs associated with penny stocks are high, reducing the number of broker-dealers who may be willing to engage in the trading of our shares. These additional penny stock disclosure requirements are burdensome and may reduce all the trading activity in the market for our common
stock. As long as the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, holders of our common stock may find it more difficult to sell their shares.�Reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including establishing and maintaining acceptable internal controls over financial reporting, are costly.�We presently do not have a business that produces significant revenues, however, the rules and regulations pursuant to the Exchange Act require a public company to provide periodic reports which will require that we engage legal, accounting and auditing services. The engagement of such services can be costly and we are likely to incur losses that may adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require that our
company establish and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting. The costs of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the limited time that management will devote to our company may make it difficult for us to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting. In the event that we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which may harm our financial condition and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our share price.� �13��Our
security holders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our securities due to state "blue sky" laws.�Each state has its own securities laws, often called "blue sky" laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state's residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers and stock brokers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. Also, the broker must be registered in that state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered, or exempt, under the laws of any states. A determination regarding registration will be made by the broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our securities. There may be significant
state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. Investors should consider the resale market for our securities to be limited. Security holders may be unable to resell their securities, or they may be unable to resell them without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.�We do not intend to pay dividends and there will be less ways in which you can make a gain on any investment in us.�We have never paid any cash or stock dividends and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in us will need to come through appreciation of the stock's price. There will
be less ways in which you can make a gain on any investment in us.�ITEM 1B.�UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.�Not Applicable.�ITEM 2.

SELECTED FINANCIAL
DATA.�Not Applicable.�ITEM 7.�MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.�The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements.�Overview�We are a web-based retailer of clothing, accessories and other personalized gifts for children. We currently sell our products through our website
www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets. We are in the process of rebranding our business under the name Maple Tree Kids. We are devoting a substantial amount of our efforts promoting our personalized children products, creating a new logo, marketing and sales collateral, and creating a new website, www.mapletreekids.com and as a result of these corporate development efforts and current financial position, we received a going concern audit opinion from our audit firm.�We can acquire our products from approximately 35 wholesale vendors all located in the United States who will also drop-ship the inventory we purchase from
them to our customers. We do not manufacture any of our own products. We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with these vendors. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from these vendors upon delivery. If the prices charged by these vendors increase and we are not able to pass on the increased price to our customers, then our margins will be reduced and this will affect our potential for future profitability.�Principal Factors Affecting our Financial Performance�Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:� �Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing
business for the next 12 months.���Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:���Our ability to develop and continually update our websites;���Our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties from whom we acquire inventory;���Our
ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products;���Our ability to attract new customers to our websites who are interested in purchasing our products; and���Our ability to manage our costs and maintain low overhead.� �16�� �Based
upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will continue to be developing our Maple Tree Kids website to sell personalized children products that will be located at www.mapletreekids.com and will be incurring expenses and not generating significant revenues.���We are dependent upon our relationship with our major customer. This customer accounted for approximately 80% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31,
2014, respectively. This major customer is not contractually obligated to purchase any minimum amount of products from us and can discontinue buying products from us at any time. If we fail to maintain this relationship, our sales will be significantly diminished. Any change in the terms of our sales to our major customer could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.���Our sales are dependent on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on cost-effective terms. Our strategy to attract customers to our website includes viral marketing, the practice
of placing advertisements and offering giveaways on various highly rated baby weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public, postings on online communities such as Facebook, MySpace, Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth; search engine optimization, marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results; and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website
providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. We expect to rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website, with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as secondary sources.�  We will continue to seek, depending on market conditions, new financing or additional sources of capital over the next 12 months. The primary potential sources of cash available to us are equity investments. We have no debt or credit lines and we have financed our operations to date through the sale of our common stock and shareholder loans. In September 2014 and October 2014 we raised $22,170 in our registered offering. This registered offering was closed on November 7, 2014. We also obtained a total of $13,000 and $10,000 of shareholder advances during the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.�Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014�Revenues�We generated revenues of $10,052 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $13,985 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease in revenue in 2015 is due to a decrease in the volume of items sold through our website and to our major customer.�Our ability to generate a significant level of revenues to support our operations, however, is very uncertain. We received a going concern opinion
from our audit firm as we continue to require additional working capital in order to devote substantially all of our efforts to rebranding our company under the name Maple Tree Kids to sell more personalized children products to the market and creating related marketing and sales collateral, a new logo and new website among other things.�Cost of Sales�Our cost of sales was $6,486 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $9,421 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the cost of sales for 2015 was due to our decrease in revenue in 2015 as we sold our merchandise to fewer retail customers in 2015.�Gross
Profit�We generated gross profit of $3,566 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $4,564 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the gross profit percentage from 33% in 2014 to 35% in 2015 was due a small increase in our selling prices to retail customers due to a change in the sales product mix to our customers in 2015.� �17��Operating Expenses�Our operating expenses
were $40,145 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $18,039 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our operating expenses in 2015 was due to an increase in professional fees related to being a public reporting company and fees associated with becoming listed on the OTCQB exchange and registering the Company's stock with the Depository Trust Company (DTC).�Net Loss�Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $36,579 and was $13,475 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net loss in 2015 was due to the reasons stated above.�Impact
of Potential Loss of our Major Customer on our Liquidity�Currently sales to our major customer constitute approximately 80% of our total revenue. Any substantial decrease in selling our products to them will substantially affect our operating results and liquidity. Although we currently have a satisfactory relationship with our major customer, if they were to terminate their relationship or stop ordering products from us, these events would currently result in a loss of substantially all of our revenue which would have a material impact on the liquidity of our Company. It is uncertain how long our major customer will continue to order products from us as we do not have any assurances from them as to how long they will continue ordering products from us. We do not have an exclusive agreement with them for selling our type of products to them.�In
the event that the Company is not able to retain our major customer or obtain new customers, we will incur increased operating losses and we will need to raise additional capital to maintain our current operations. We presently are seeking to increase our web-based sales by attracting new customers to our websites. We are not presently negotiating any agreements with any new major customers.�Liquidity and Capital Resources�As of December 31, 2015, we had cash of $1,983, total assets of $1,983 and a working capital deficit of $24,983 compared to $26,693 in cash, $26,693 in total assets and $11,596 in working capital as of December
31, 2014.�The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Report:�Cash Flow� ��December 31,���2015��2014��������Net

Activities�Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of net loss as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $37,710, which consisted of a net loss of $36,579, and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $1,131.� �18��Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December
31, 2014 consisted of net loss as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9,961, which consisted of a net loss of $13,475, non-cash charge of inventory acquired from our principal shareholder through shareholder advances of $3,378 and cash provided by working capital of $136. The cash provided by working capital was due to an increase in accrued liabilities of $136.�Investing Activities�During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had no investing activities. �Financing Activities�During the year ended December 31,
2015, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $13,000 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $32,170 for the year ended December 31, 2014 a decrease of $19,170. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due to the decrease in proceeds from the sale of our common stock of $22,170, offset by an increase in short term cash advances from our principal shareholder of $3,000.�See Note 5 of the Notes to our Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our Stockholders' Equity.
�During the year ended December 31, 2015, our total cash requirements will exceed our cash balances. Currently, we do not have sufficient cash in our bank accounts to cover our estimated expenses for the next 12 months. Our current projected average monthly negative cash flow is approximately $2,000 per month. Based on our current cash position at December 31, 2015 and projected spending, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our current operations. We anticipate meeting our future cash requirements through a combination of equity financing from the proceeds of this offering and debt financing from our principal shareholder to fund the costs of developing the business and being a public reporting company. Although we anticipate meeting our future cash requirements though, among other things, debt financing from our principal shareholder,
we do not currently have any agreements with our principal shareholder to provide such financing, written or unwritten.�We estimate that our operating expenses, based on us being able to raise the necessary equity capital to execute our business plan, will be approximately $100,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources.� Description�Target completiondate

intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing. We currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further financings or raising any capital. There is no assurance that any financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. We may not raise sufficient funds to fully carry out any business plan. Management's plans for the Company may include securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts.�Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements�As of the date of this report, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.�Inflation�The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant.�Critical Accounting Policies�Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete listing of these policies is included in Note�2 of the notes to our financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management.Revenue Recognition�Sales to consumers are recorded when goods are shipped and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of operations.�The customer authorizes us to charge their credit card at the time of purchase with the understanding their credit card will be charged upon shipment. We recognize revenue based on the below three criteria. Our policy is to allow the return of any unused merchandise purchased from us for any reason for a 15-day period after the date of sale.�Delivery has occurred. We have our
vendors drop ship inventory to our customers and we recognize revenue when we are notified that shipment has occurred.�Fee is fixed or determinable. The price is deemed to be fixed and determinable based on our successful collection history and our arrangement with our customers.�Collectability is reasonably assured. We determine for all of our customers whether collectability is reasonably assured pursuant to our credit review policy. All credit card payments are approved and processed through our website.�We evaluate the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition�Principal Agent Considerations, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions.
Generally, according to this accounting principle, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned.�Based on the above facts, we recognize all revenue as a Principal, not an agent.� �20��Use
of Estimates�The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.�Recent Accounting Pronouncements�Other than Accounting Standards Update 2014-10 that removed the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP, management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently
adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.�ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.�Not Applicable.�ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.�None.�ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.�Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures�We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.�As required by Rule 13a-15(e), our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of Ms. Irina Goldman, our President and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2015. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, Ms. Irina Goldman, determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.� �21��Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting�Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act defines internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:� �Pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;���Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and;����Provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.�All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.�Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the framework based on the criteria
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on our assessment management determined that as of December 31, 2015, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective based on those criteria.�Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting�We will regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new and more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.�During
the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, our internal control over financial reporting.�ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.�We have no information to disclose that was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, that was not reported.� �22��PART

FIRM��To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of�Maple Tree Kids, Inc.�Nanuet, NY�We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2015. Maple Tree Kids, Inc.'s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.�We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.�In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.�The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital and recurring losses. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.�/s/ ZBS Group LLP�Plainview, New York��

TREE KIDS, INC.Notes to Financial StatementsDecember 31, 2015�Note 1 � Description of the Business, Merger and Going Concern�Maple Tree Kids Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated on August 14, 2013 in the State of Nevada. At the time of our incorporation, our president and sole stockholder subscribed for and purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000. The Company is a retail distribution company selling all of its products over the internet in the United States, operating in the infant and toddler products
business market. The Company's products consist of personalized infant and toddler clothing, toys, towels, wash clothes, bibs, disposable products, blankets, baby wraps and slings, wet bags and other accessories.��Predecessor Business - Maple Tree Kids LLC:�Maple Tree Kids LLC a Vermont Limited Liability Company was formed on August 12, 2005 under State of Vermont statutes. Under the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement ("operating agreement"), the term of the Company expires on certain events of dissolution. The Company had one member at who owned 100% of Maple Tree Kids LLC.�Sale
of Member's LLC Interest:�On August 16, 2013, the former single member of Maple Tree Kids LLC sold 100% of her interest in the Company to our president and sole stockholder for $8,800. All cash, inventory and equipment were distributed to the prior member at the closing and the URL websites, customer list and vendor list were retained by the Company and the new sole member. The prior member assumed all liabilities of the Company at closing.�Merger Agreement�On September
26, 2013 the Company, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, merged into Maple Tree Kids, Inc, a Nevada corporation and ceased to exist as a Vermont LLC as of the date of this merger. Our principal shareholder, who was the sole member of Maple Tree Kids LLC at the time of the merger, received 1 million shares of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. pursuant to the plan of merger, resulting in her owning a total of 2 million shares of Maple Tree Kids, Inc after the merger and continuing to be the sole shareholder of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. Maple Tree Kids, Inc. had assets consisting of cash of $1,000 and stockholders' equity of $1,000 with no revenue or expenses incurred since its date of incorporation to the time
of this merger.�Financial Reporting � Reorganization�For financial reporting purposes, this merger transaction was recorded as a reorganization of Maple Tree Kids LLC whereby Maple Tree Kids LLC is deemed to be the continuing, surviving entity for accounting purposes, but through this merger, has deemed to have adopted the capital structure and now operates under the name of Maple Tree Kids, Inc., who became the surviving entity for legal purposes. Accordingly, all references to the former member's initial capital contribution in Maple Tree Kids LLC been restated to reflect the equivalent number of Maple Tree Kids, Inc. common shares outstanding at the merger date and subsequent capital contributions and capital withdrawals from Maple Tree Kids LLC have been recorded as changes to additional paid-in capital. In other words, the $3,075 of the initial capital contribution made to Maple Tree Kids LLC by
the former member of the LLC at August 12, 2005 (date of inception of Maple Tree Kids LLC) has been restated to 2,000,000 common shares outstanding at the par value of $.001 or $2,000 and the remaining $1,075 capital contributed recorded as additional paid-in capital, as of August 12, 2005. Subsequent member capital contributions and withdrawals made from member's equity have been recorded as increases and decreases to additional paid-in capital.� �F-7��The
Company's business activities are focused on developing a market for selling personalized children products and rebranding its name to "Maple Tree Kids", for selling these personalized baby and toddler products and other products to customers through its new website that is currently under construction, mapletreekids.com. Its current business activities include working with new vendors to bring to market more personalized baby products. The Company will be attracting customers to its websites by viral marketing, including placing advertisements and offering promotions on various baby weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and postings to other
online communities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in distributing personalized baby products through its Maple Tree Kids website into the retail market.�Sales of the Company's products are made to retail consumers. The Company buys all of its products from various manufacturers located in the United States and all products are marketed and sold under these manufacturers' trademarks. The Company presently sells all of its products over the internet through its website,
polkadotpatch.com.�The Company's product sales into the infant and toddler retail market are subject to numerous contingencies, some of which are beyond management's control. These contingencies include general and regional economic conditions, prices for the Company's products, competition, and changes in regulation, various additional political, economic, and other uncertainties.�Going Concern�The Company generated a net loss of $36,579 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and expects to generate losses over the next 12 months, due to an anticipated increase
in its general and administrative expenses due to the above mentioned business activities and not having sufficient cash to fund its current and future operations. Therefore there is no assurance that future operations will result in any profit. If the Company cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably in 2016, the Company may need to cease its operations in 2016. If the business operations expand, operating expenses will increase and the profit margins may not be able to cover this increase, and as a result the Company may not be able to develop into a profitable business in the future.�Management's plans for the
Company include raising additional capital through either debt or equity issuances. Management estimates the minimum amount of additional funding necessary to enable the Company to remain viable and continue its operations for at least the twelve months following the date of the financial statements is approximately $20,000. In September 2014 and October 2014 we raised $22,170 in our registered offering. This registered offering was closed on November 7, 2014. We also obtained a total of $13,000 and $10,000 of shareholder advances during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
�No assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts to raise additional capital from present or future shareholders or from its principal shareholder. The failure to raise additional capital needed to achieve its business plans will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.�Note 2�� Summary of Significant Accounting Policies�Fiscal Year: The
Company's fiscal year ends December 31.��Cash and Cash equivalents:�We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.�Use of Estimates:�The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. There were no significant estimates at December 31, 2015 and December
31, 2014.� �F-8��Fair Value of Financial Instruments:�The book values of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity's own assumptions (unobservable inputs).�The hierarchy consists of three levels:�� �Level
one�� Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;�Level two�� Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable;�and�Level three�� Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.�Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.�Segments
and Related Information: The Company operates primarily in one principal business segment, infant and toddler products.��Amortization of Website: The accompanying balance sheet reflects our websites at cost less accumulated amortization. The estimated useful life is 5 years and these websites were developed in 2005 and amortized using the straight line method over its useful life. Our website is www.polkadotpatch.com.�The
cost and accumulated amortization of the websites for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were both $5,435 as these websites were fully amortized at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.�Revenue Recognition: Sales to consumers are recorded when the price is fixed or determinable and goods are shipped to the customers. Sales are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the accompanying statements of income. Allowances for returns are estimated based on historical customer return rates. Customers
pre-pay for orders through our website with their credit cards prior to the shipment of the goods, which takes place within a few days after the order is placed. The Company does not carry inventory and all orders are drop-shipped by our vendors and shipped directly by them to our customers.�The Company evaluates the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-45, Revenue Recognition�Principal Agent Considerations , in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the
Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If the Company is not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, the Company generally records the net amounts as commissions earned. The Company records revenue as a principal pursuant to above mentioned factors establishing that the revenue be recorded as a principal.�Allowances Against Accounts Receivable:�The
Company did not have any accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company will record allowances against accounts receivable based upon contractually agreed-upon deductions for items such as customer returns. These deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity and historical product returns. All such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales. The Company gives all its customers a 14 day product return policy on all sales; the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer's account balance. After 14 days there are no returns but the
Company may issue an optional store credit to the customer for up to 25% of the sale amount. There are no returns for sales of products that are personalized for its customers. The Company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels. There was no sales returns allowance recorded at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The historical sales return rate for the Company in relation to its total sales have not been significant.�Income Taxes: Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized. We did not provide any current or deferred income tax provision or benefit for any periods presented to date because we have continued to experience a net operating loss since inception and therefore provide a 100% valuation
allowance against all of our deferred tax assets.� �F-9��The Company adopted the FASB ASC accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in the FASB ASC Topic "Income Taxes". This guidance prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. This guidance also provides accounting guidance on derecognizing,
classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in 2015 or 2014.�The company has no deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. They have a net operating loss carry-forward for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $59,000 at December 31, 2015, that is available to offset future taxable income, which will begin to expire in the year 2028. The
Company took a 100% valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset.�Earnings Per Share: Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. The merger with Maple Tree Kids LLC took place on September 26, 2013 and prior periods have been restated to reflect the change in the capitalization of the Company at the merger date.�Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $- and $- respectively These expenses are recorded under general and administrative
expenses.�Shipping and Handling Fees Charged to Customers and Reported as Revenue: Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified on the Statements of Income under the caption selling, general and administrative expenses.��Gift Cards: The Company will collect the proceeds from gift cards issued and record a liability for the full amount sold. This liability will be reduced when the Company honors redemptions of the gift cards as a form of tender. As a result, the Company will maintain a liability equivalent to 100% of the proceeds from unredeemed gift cards, less estimated unredeemed gift cards. For the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 there were no significant gift cards sales, therefore the "unredeemed gift certificates" liability was $0 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.�In recognizing the unredeemed gift card income above, the Company considered the guidance under ASC 405-20-40, Liabilities-Extinguishments of Liabilities-Derecognition paragraph 40-1 that states "A debtor shall derecognize a liability if and only if it has been extinguished. A liability under this standard has been extinguished if either of the following conditions is met: (a) the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or (b) the debtor
is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability either judicially or by the creditor." The recognition of unredeemed gift card income is not expected to be material in future reporting periods. If we have future sales of gift cards, we will review historical gift card redemption information at each reporting period to assess the continued appropriateness of the gift card breakage rates and pattern of redemption.�Contingencies: Certain conditions may exist which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company's legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.�If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company's financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is
reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.�Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they arise from guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.� �F-10��Recently-Issued Accounting Standards:�In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for revenue
from contracts with customers that will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Entities can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective approach
or a modified retrospective approach. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.�In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the accounting for share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. In this case, the performance target would be required to be treated as a performance condition, and should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance also addresses when to recognize the related compensation cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.�In
June 2014 Accounting Standards Update 2014-10 removed the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt this ASU effective with the December 31, 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage financial information.
�ASU 2014-15 � "Presentation of Financial Statements�Going Concern�Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15")." In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 requiring management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, starting December 15, 2016; the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2016.�Note 3 ��Major Customer�The Company has one major customer, which represents approximately 80% of total sales
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.�Note 4 � Shareholder Advances and Related Party Transactions�During the second quarter of 2014, the principal shareholder sold baby products inventory that she held personally to the Company at a total price of $3,378. This inventory was subsequently sold in 2014 to various customers. The shareholder advanced $3,378 to the Company to purchase this inventory, as a non-interest bearing loan, unsecured and payable on demand.

My crimson king maple came very professionally packed. I was able to get it in the ground within 24 hours. Ordering in March, the tree already had buds on it. After a little root stimulator, and regular watering, this tree has bloomed out wonderfully. The color is absolutely amazing. Crimson to deep purple!! Wow. This is exactly why I bought this tree. The color. All my neighbors have been commenting on how pretty it is. I am very thankful to Fast Growing Trees for their professionalism, and quality products. As soon as Im done writing this review, Im purchasing some more trees!! Thanks again for a fantastic experience

My tree arrived much later than Fast-Growing-Trees promised, with that being said, the top was bent in half and the leaves looked wilted and very dry. We planted it immediately and have given it plenty of water. Many weeks later, and the top has not straightened out, and the leaves are still wilted and dry

Excited to have planted this unique maple. It arrived well packaged and healthy. The growth rate is much slower than expected. Fingers crossed for significant growth this season.

 Planting & Care
	


It's Easy to Plant & Care for Your Crimson King Maple





Step 1: Dig Your Hole


          Select a site with full to partial sun and moist or well drained soil for your Crimson King Maple.
          
          First, dig each hole so that it is just shallower than the root ball and at least twice the width.
          
          Then loosen the soil in the planting hole so the roots can easily break through.
          
          Use your shovel or try dragging the points of a pitch fork along the sides and bottom of the hole.
        




Step 2: Place Your Plant


          Next, separate the roots of your Crimson King Maple gently with your fingers and position them downward in the hole.
          
          The top of the root flare, where the roots end and the trunk begins, should be about an inch above the surrounding soil.
          
          Then make sure the plant is exactly vertical in the hole.
          
          To make it just right, use a level.
        


Step 3: Backfill Your Hole


         As you backfill the hole, apply water to remove air pockets.
         
         Remove debris like stones and grass and completely break up any dirt clumps.
         
         Water your Crimson King Maple again after the transplant is complete.

I've only seen one in Oklahoma. It is a beautiful Crimson color all year, also has a beautiful shape too. I have wanted one for a long time, but could not find one at any of tree nurseries within driving distance.  I really wanted a larger one. Just glad we found you on line and I am getting one of these beautiful trees. Anna

I've only seen one in Oklahoma. It is a beautiful Crimson color all year, also has a beautiful shape too. I have wanted one for a long time, but could not find one at any of tree nurseries within driving distance.  I really wanted a larger one. Just glad we found you on line and I am getting one of these beautiful trees. Anna

how much water does this tree need?

                            on Jul 6, 2014
                        








BEST ANSWER: During its formative years, your maple will require weekly watering of at least 1½ inches of water. Even as it matures, your tree will still need plenty of water during the summer months. Be sure, though, to water correctly. Light green leaves are a sign of over-watering, while drooping leaves signify both over-watering and under-watering.

I bought one from FGT last year and it has fully leafed out.  Check the tips of the branches.  They have red growth tips that are pliable, wait it out.  If the growth tips are grayish and brittle, they are dead.  Check further down the main stem though because new growth can emerge from there below ant areas that might have died.

BEST ANSWER: Spring is normally the best time to plant. However I bought mine mid June and planted one late June and the other is still in its container and will be planted as soon as another area of our yard is cleared which will be in the next couple of weeks. Both trees are doing well. They haven't lost any leaves and have gotten a bit of new growth. It's best if they don't get full sun all day when they are young but will still do ok if so. They just seem to do better if shaded from the late afternoon sun when young.

During the first growing season, use only slow-release fertilizer tablets on your new maple. Refrain from using stronger fertilization methods until your tree becomes more established. Any 10-10-10 fertilizer, such as Miracle Grow, will be suitable. Fertilize your Maple twice a month when it is coming out of dormancy, and once a month during the summer. Discontinue before the tree returns to its dormant state.
