Transportation

The transportation infrastructure sector includes ports, airports, terminal and inter-modal operations, surface transportation, logistics companies and other service providers to the transportation sector.  Companies in these sectors benefit from several compelling investment characteristics including high barriers to entry, increasing capacity constraints, growth-oriented capital expenditures, stable demand, and high degrees of operating leverage.  Moreover, as infrastructure both in the U.S. and abroad continues to age, the need for expansion and renovation is creating the opportunity for private investment.  Transportation OperationsHighstar's existing transportation platform includes investments in ports operations through Ports America and aviation services through London City Airport.  Ports America is the largest independent marine terminal operator on the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. London City Airport is the fifth busiest airport serving the London area.
