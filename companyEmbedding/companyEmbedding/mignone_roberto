Despite the fact that hedge funds are often viewed as slow and underperforming investment vehicles of the financial world of yesteryear, there are still ways to parse the data to beat the market. At Insider Monkey, we track the best picks of the best hedge funds, and we've used this dual-screening technique to help retail investors achieve stock market superstardom. Our small-cap strategy outperformed the market by 18% a year for more than a decade, and since sharing these picks with the public last fall, we've outperformed the S&P 500 index by 18 percentage points in only 5 months. We've also built the Billionaire Hedge Fund Index in collaboration with MarketWatch, which was up on the general indexes by the high-single-digits in 2012.  Here's how to use this strategy yourself, but our point is simple. It has been rewarding, historically, to pay attention to the smart money.

Using Mignone's latest fourth quarter 13F filing with the SEC, we can see which stocks he was using to prepare for 2013. Here's his top five. General Motors 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    GM, -0.93%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         is the hedge fund manager's No. 1 stock pick, and it has been a rewarding investment of late. Mignone's GM position comprises roughly 5.5% of his entire equity portfolio, and shares of the auto maker are up 19.2% since the start of the fourth quarter. Wall Street's average price target on GM represents another 27% upside from current levels. The crux of this stock's bullish thesis lies in its ability to provide solid growth at a reasonable price (GARP). Bolstered by strong emerging market demand and its ability to expand assembly operations domestically, the sell-side forecasts EPS growth of 27% next year, and a long-range annual rate of 12-13% through at least 2017. Shares of GM still trade at a meager PEG of 0.77, and are at parity with their book valuation. It is easy to see why Mignone holds the stock with such high regard. Morgan Stanley 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    MS, +0.17%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         is the hedgie's second largest equity position, slightly smaller than his stake in GM. Though they operate in completely different sectors, Morgan Stanley's investment idea is essentially the same: it is a GARP play. At just over 0.7 times book, shares of MS trade at one of the lowest valuations of all the S&P 500-listed financial stocks, and its growth potential is one of the best. On average, analysts expect Morgan Stanley to generate EPS growth of 16.3% a year over the next half-decade—fifth highest in its entire sector.

                                         meanwhile, is Mignone's No. 3 pick, and is also a popular investment choice of Stephen Mandel, Jim Simons and George Soros (check out Soros's full portfolio here). TripAdvisor has been in Mignone's portfolio since the first quarter of last year, and over the past 12 months, shares of the online travel company have gained a whopping 42.8%.

                                         has been in TripAdvisor's proverbial "backyard" ever since its 2011 acquisition of ITA Software, but these are only issues over the long, long term. Looking at a shorter time horizon, TripAdvisor is a strong momentum play, through and through. Earnings growth is expected to average between 21% and 26% over the next two years, and the stock isn't ridiculously expensive at 20.6 times forward earnings.

                                         is Mignone's fourth largest equity holding, and has been in the hedgie's top 10 since Q4 2011. The midsize credit protection company has already popped more than 32% in 2013 alone, hitting a new 52-week high last week. A key factor behind this appreciation was Assured's court victory against Flagstar Bancorp (FBC) in early February, and optimism is riding high on the toes of Q4 earnings. Despite their recent run-up, AGO shares still trade at a mere 7.1 times forward earnings and a 26% discount to their book value. Fellow fund managers Debra Fine and Wilbur Ross join Mignone in this stock, which is great company to have. Google, lastly, rounds out Mignone's "fab five," so to speak. The tech giant has already rewarded shareholders significantly year-to-date, returning 13%. Shares trade just off their all-time high north of $800, but there is still reason to believe in this stock, as it looks like another GARP play. Sell-side analysts expects EPS growth of a little over 17% next year, and over the longer term, forecasts predict annual expansion of 14-15% through at least 2017. Despite these prospects, Google still trades below 15 times forward earnings, and Wall Street's average price target predicts another 5-6% in upside. Google was also the third most popular stock among the 450-plus hedge funds we track last quarter, with 126 bulls in the crowd, so to speak. This total was smaller than Apple

Stocks brace for volatility in earnings deluge; Fed meeting looms
              
              With nearly a fifth of earnings reports out, investors are divided on how early corporate reports are serving as an indicator of the overall health of the U.S. economy, and that could contribute to a volatile week as stocks linger near record highs.

Right before his 29th birthday in July 2000, he launched Bridger Management which now manages about $2 Billion. He charges a 1.5 percent management fee and 20 percent incentive fee. He believes fund size is a drag on the performance of a long/short fund manager, so he has no desire to run a much bigger fund than what he is currently running. Roberto Mignone’s Bridger Management keeps their returns extremely secret. They do extensive analysis and follow a long/short strategy. Katherine Burton profiled Roberto Mignone in her book “Hedge Hunters”. She explains Mignone’s strategy as follow:   Roberto Mignone graduated from Harvard Business School and joined John Griffin at Blue Ridge Capital. Right before his 29th birthday in July 2000, he launched Bridger Management which now manages about $2 Billion. He charges a 1.5 percent management fee and 20 percent incentive fee. He believes fund size is a drag on the performance of a long/short fund manager, so he has no desire to run a much bigger fund than what he is currently running. Roberto Mignone’s Bridger Management keeps their returns extremely secret. They do extensive analysis and follow a long/short strategy. Katherine Burton profiled Roberto Mignone in her book “Hedge Hunters”. She explains Mignone’s strategy as follow:Mignone’s core positions include roughly thirty long positions, which are each limited to 5 percent of the portfolio initially and never get larger than 10 percent. He has about sixty core short positions, each no bigger than 2 percent at the start. He never allows them to grow bigger than 4 percent. Overall, the gross exposure is 150 to 200 percent, meaning the value of the long and short positions adds up to 1.5 to 2 times the net assets in the fund.
