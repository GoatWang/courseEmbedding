Former Taser Axon Enterprise's stock tumbles 4.4% premarket after unfavorable patent ruling
Former Taser Axon Enterprise's stock tumbles 4.4% premarket after unfavorable patent ruling

Digital Ally's stock rockets after 'significant' patent win against Axon
Shares of Digital Ally Inc.  rocketed 62% toward a five-month high in premarket trade Friday, after the maker of video surveillance products announced a "significant" victory in its patent battle with Axon Enterprises Inc. , which was formerly Taser International. Digital Ally said the U.S. Patent Office denied Axon's petition for inter parties review (IPR) of Digital's patent, as the petition did not establish a "reasonable likelihood" that Axon would prevail. The patent in question covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices when a law enforcement vehicle's light bar is activated. "We look forward to restarting our patent infringement litigation in U.S. District Court against Axon, which had been stayed pending the Patent Office IPRs," said Digital's Chief Executive Stanton Ross. "We will now take the necessary actions to move to a trial where a jury can finally end Axon's willful infringement and assess damages due to us." Digital's stock had tumbled 23% year to date through Thursday, while Axon shares had edged up 3.3% and the S&P 500  had gained 7.6%.

Former Taser Axon Enterprise's stock tumbles 4.4% premarket after unfavorable patent ruling
Former Taser Axon Enterprise's stock tumbles 4.4% premarket after unfavorable patent ruling

Digital Ally's stock rockets after 'significant' patent win against Axon
Shares of Digital Ally Inc.  rocketed 62% toward a five-month high in premarket trade Friday, after the maker of video surveillance products announced a "significant" victory in its patent battle with Axon Enterprises Inc. , which was formerly Taser International. Digital Ally said the U.S. Patent Office denied Axon's petition for inter parties review (IPR) of Digital's patent, as the petition did not establish a "reasonable likelihood" that Axon would prevail. The patent in question covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices when a law enforcement vehicle's light bar is activated. "We look forward to restarting our patent infringement litigation in U.S. District Court against Axon, which had been stayed pending the Patent Office IPRs," said Digital's Chief Executive Stanton Ross. "We will now take the necessary actions to move to a trial where a jury can finally end Axon's willful infringement and assess damages due to us." Digital's stock had tumbled 23% year to date through Thursday, while Axon shares had edged up 3.3% and the S&P 500  had gained 7.6%.

Body Worn Cameras
Most Versatile Body Camera on the Market
Digital Ally™ designs and manufactures the most versatile body camera on the market. Choose from a one-piece or two-piece design. Each unit comes with a variety of mounts and camera modules that help meet your agency's needs.

Protection for everyone!
Officers and general public covered
Studies have consistently shown that by deploying body worn cameras, agencies see a reduction in the number of complaints and use of force incidents. With permanent metadata embedded in every video, agencies can be confident that their evidence will be the highest quality and maintain strict chain of custody and audit requirements for prosecution.






With the ability to automatically activate our FirstVu HD body-worn cameras and in-car video systems with the company's patented VuLink® technology, our officers no longer have to think about pressing a button to record interactions. This functionality allows to meet our goals of increasing the safety for our officers while ensuring that we capture a comprehensive perspective of the event.
-Sheriff Rick Clark | Pickens County Sheriff's Office






The Right Tool For The Job
One size does NOT fit all!

Two-Piece Solution
FirstVu HD 
The FirstVu HD two-piece model can be mounted on an officer's chest, pouch, shoulder, helmet, belt, or vehicle. 






One-Piece Solution
FirstVu HD One
The FirstVu HD one-piece model gives agencies an additional option when choosing which body worn camera to purchase. The FirstVu HD One builds upon the same platform as our two piece model.









High Definition Video & Audio
720p Resolution with 130 degree angle field of view
The camera captures exactly what the officer sees during the incident. HD Audio recording built into the camera.












Videos On The Go
Digital Ally's VuVault® platform continues to expand with the VuVault® mobile application for Android and iOS.








VuVault®
In the Palm of Every Officer
The app allows for full system control including the ability to view the video feed, add notes and play back recorded videos. You also have the ability to view the remaining storage space and battery life. VuVaultGO® allows for secure access to recordings and camera controls, GPS & event tagging. VuVaultGO® is included with every FirstVu HD purchase.






Docking Stations
Station Headquarters | Office/Home-Use
Our two Dock options allow your agency to upload your FirstVu HD Body Worn Camera video evidence the way you want to. Choose from either our 12-unit Smart Docking Station or our One-Unit portable Dock you can place in your desk or store at home. Both docking stations can automatically upload recorded videos on to your VuVault® server or onto your VuVault.Com® cloud service.















Industry's only "Smart Dock"
Secure Timely Transfer | "Plug & Play"
Our 12-Unit Smart Docking Station has a 500GB Local Memory hard drive that allows for a faster transfer of data to local or cloud software storage. This unit also can simultaneously upload 4 hours per 12 FirstVu HD cameras within a 15 minute shift change. All of this while charging units and making updates to any configuration needed for your devices.

Safety & Accident




                    Video Event Data Recorder (VEDR)
                

                    Digital Ally, Inc.
                

                    April 10, 2012 - Products
                

Digital Ally, Inc. has launched a new Video Event Data Recorder (VEDR) designed to provide liability protection as well as insurance and operational savings through proof in vehicular accidents and against fraudulent claims; inspiring safe and professional behavior; incident review for training purposes; monitoring blind spots or separate vehicle compartments; etc. Digital Ally is a leading provider of fleet video systems, which are used by thousands of companies and governmental departments and agencies in all 50 states and around the world.
In addition to the initial insurance and long term savings usually associated with installing VEDRs, Digital Ally's Video Event Data Recorders provide additional savings opportunities by providing software at no cost and not requiring ongoing contracts or additional equipment.
Digital Ally’s DVM-250 and DVM-250Plus model VEDRs record and store video, audio and detailed information from vehicle involved incidents. Recordings may be set to automatically start by reaching specific speeds, driving within specified GPS corridors or ranges, and numerous other customizable options, including violent maneuvers, shifting the vehicle into reverse, emergency lights, door sensors, etc. Recordings may also be started manually, such as to record criminal actions of passengers or events transpiring outside a stopped vehicle.
To capture the actions that led up to an incident, as well as to allow for manual recording delay from human reaction time, 30 seconds prior to the moment a recording is triggered is also captured, which is referred to as “pre-event recording”. For instance, an abrupt change in acceleration/deceleration, such as during a vehicular accident or sudden stop, can be set to automatically trigger a recording. However, if another person caused the incident, such as illegally turning in front of the VEDR-equipped vehicle, it will also be recorded, providing valuable protection to the driver and their employer.
Digital Ally’s VEDRs are integrated into a rear-view mirror so that they do not interfere with the driver’s line of site or take up valuable space. Their design allows for easy installation into any type of vehicle, including those that did not previously include a rear-view mirror. Integrated cameras and a microphone inside the rear-view mirror capture video in front of the vehicle as well as video and audio inside the vehicle. An optional third camera and monitor hidden behind the mirror glass are often used when backing the vehicle up or monitoring a vehicle compartment. The specialized one-way mirror glass allows this optional monitor to remain invisible while not in use.
Digital Ally’s VEDRs record in D1 (720x480) high resolution video with customizable frame rates and record times. The systems utilize solid state memory, the most durable, vibration-proof and reliable medium for mobile video documentation. Recordings are saved onto 16GB of internal solid state memory with optional redundancy onto 8GB-32GB removable SD memory cards. When using SD memory cards, the internal memory will loop, automatically overwriting the oldest recordings.
Recordings may be downloaded from the SD memory cards, through USB or with optional wireless download. Attempts to tamper with recordings can be detected with authenticity verification and additional security is available through disabling the USB port when using wireless download and locking the SD card access door.
The systems come with the GPS receiver/antenna, microphone and cameras, etc. as well as back office software. For more information, contact Digital Ally at 800-440-4947, [email protected] or visit www.digitalallyinc.com.

Announces 2017 First Quarter Operating ResultsMarketwiredMay 15, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLENEXA, KS--(Marketwired - May 15, 2017) - Digital Ally, Inc. (  NASDAQ :  DGLY ), which develops, manufactures and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement, homeland security and commercial applications, today announced its operating results for the first quarter of 2017. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on May 15, 2017 (see details below).Highlights for Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 Total revenue increased 18.7% to approximately $5.23 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with approximately $4.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the large commercial order received in the first quarter 2017 from American Medical Response ("AMR") for DVM-250 event recorders with FleetVU and asset tracking service. The AMR contract was for 1,550 DVM-250 systems as well as FleetVU manager cloud storage and system implementation, most of which were delivered in first quarter 2017 and had a positive impact on revenues. Recurring service revenues will start in second quarter 2017.   On a sequential basis, total revenue increased 51.8% to approximately $5.23 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with approximately $3.45 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  Gross profit margin improved to 43.5% of total revenue in the first quarter 2017, compared with 42.1% in the year-earlier quarter.  On a sequential basis, gross margin improved to 43.5% of total revenue in the first quarter 2017, compared with 4.3% in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  During the first quarter of 2017 we shipped more than 1,800 units of our mirror based products, including shipments to law enforcement and commercial customers. This represents our highest number of mirror based units shipped during any quarter since 2010. This demonstrates the traction in our commercial DVM-250 business, as well as our DVM-800 and DVM-800 HD products.   Service and other revenues increased 71% during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with the year-earlier quarter. We have recently introduced several new cloud-based and other recurring service offerings to our product suite, including our revamped VuVault.com cloud storage service to law enforcement customers and the FleetVU Manager, our driver management, training and asset tracking cloud systems for non-law enforcement customers. Our FleetVu Manager users are able to manage and monitor their fleet drivers using their own customized and defined feedback parameters, such as speed, hard braking, geo-fencing and erratic turns, all of which are automatically uploaded to FleetVuManager.com without having to manually sort through hours of recorded video events. These recurring revenue services generate more predictable and stable revenue streams for us.   We recently released our new DVM-800 HD in-car video system, which provides the first full HD quality in-car video system available on the market. The DVM-800 HD is the new standard in high definition 1080p in-car video systems for law enforcement and is gaining the attention of our customers and potential customers because of its advanced features at an attractive price point.   During 2016 we filed patent infringement lawsuits against two competitors, Axon Enterprise, Inc. (formerly Taser International, Inc.) and Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a as WatchGuard Video. We have alleged that these competitors are infringing on our patented "auto-activation" feature embodied in our VuLink product. We believe that our patented auto activation feature is becoming an industry standard required in a majority of competitive bids to supply body cameras to law enforcement customers. Law enforcement agencies across the country have recognized the ground-breaking nature of our "auto-activation" patents and are demanding this technology. We believe that Axon and WatchGuard have grown their market shares on the back of our innovations because they were unable to develop their own solutions. We will continue to aggressively pursue our claims that Axon and WatchGuard have willfully infringed our patents. Further, we believe that the outcome of this litigation will generally set the competitive landscape for body-worn cameras utilized by law enforcement agencies for the foreseeable future.  The Company reported an operating loss of ($1,802,213) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with an operating loss of ($2,337,895) in the year-earlier quarter. On a sequential basis, our operating loss improved to ($1,802,213) in the first quarter 2017, compared with an operating loss of ($4,013,995) in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  A net loss of ($2,032,955), or ($0.36) per share, was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of ($2,313,125), or ($0.44) per share, in the three months ended March 31, 2016.   On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded an adjusted net loss of ($1,256,544), or ($0.22) per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of ($1,760,047), or ($0.34) per share in the year-earlier quarter.  Management Comments"We are excited to report that first quarter revenues were up 19% from prior-year levels and 52% on a sequential basis," stated Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally Inc. "We shipped more mirrors in first quarter 2017 than any quarter since 2010 and our service revenues were up 71% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to year-earlier levels. Our strategy of expanding our recurring service-based revenue to help stabilize and grow our revenues on a quarterly basis is apparent in our first quarter 2017 results.""We are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers and utilize our core technology of mobile audio/video recording equipment together with our cloud storage and archiving services. These new market channels do not effectively utilize the power of audio/video recordings, which could represent very large untapped addressable markets for our products and services. If successful, we believe that these new market channels could yield increased recurring service revenues for us in 2017 and beyond," Mr. Ross continued. "We are promoting a new revenue model that bundles our product offerings, including the long-term lease of our body-worn and/or in-car audio/video hardware, together with a monthly subscription for our cloud storage, search and archiving services for the underlying audio and video material. We believe this revenue service model may appeal to our customers, in particular our commercial and other non-law enforcement customers because it reduces the capital outlay up front and eliminates repairs and maintenance in exchange for level monthly payments for the utilization of the equipment, data storage and management services." "We recently announced the launch of the DVM-800 HD in-car video system, which we believe will be disruptive in the market and will lead to an expansion of our overall market share in the law enforcement channel. The DVM-800 HD system provides full 1080P high definition video at a cost-effective price point, which we believe is a competitive market advantage for us.""Our international revenues decreased to $29,806 in first quarter 2017 compared to $313,729 during 2016. Our first quarter 2017 international revenues were disappointing after several positive quarters; however, the international sales cycle generally takes longer than domestic business and we have a number of bids outstanding to international customers.""We had approximately $6.8 million in net working capital available at March 31, 2017, including $3.4 million of accounts receivable and $9.7 million of inventory. We raised $4.0 million through the issuance of 8% Secured Convertible Debentures in December 2016. These mature in March 2018 unless converted by their holders at $5.00 per share before such date. The Debentures represent a current liability as of March 31, 2017. Our goal is to reduce inventory levels during 2017 to provide additional working capital and improve our operating results to generate the funds to retire the Debentures. We may also pursue the raise of additional capital if required," concluded Ross.First Quarter Operating ResultsFor the three months ended March 31, 2017, our total revenue increased by 19% to approximately $5.2 million, compared with revenue of approximately $4.4 million for the three months March 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the large commercial order received in the first quarter 2017 from AMR for DVM-250 event recorders with FleetVU and asset tracking service. The AMR contract was for 1,550 DVM-250 systems as well as FleetVU manager cloud storage and system implementation, most of which were delivered in first quarter 2017 and had a positive impact on revenues. International revenue decreased to $29,806 during first quarter 2017, versus $313,729 during first quarter 2016. Gross profit increased 23% to $2,276,849 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, versus $1,853,619 in 2016. Read MoreOur gross margin increase is commensurate with the 19% increase in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreasing to 56% from 58% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We expect that gross margins will continue to improve in 2017 because we believe we have corrected the quality control and other warranty related issues affecting our FirstVU HD product during recent quarters. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800, DVM-800 HD and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase our commercial market penetration in 2017. In addition, as revenues from these products increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased approximately 3% to $4,079,062 in the three months ended March 31, 2017, versus $4,191,514 a year earlier. We reported an operating loss of ($1,802,213) for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with an operating loss of ($2,337,895) in the previous year.Interest income decreased to $5,061 in first quarter 2017, from $8,992 in 2016. Non-cash charges totaled ($155,252) in first quarter 2017 compared with non-cash income of $16,533 in the year-earlier quarter. Such non-cash income (charges) reflect changes in the fair value of the secured convertible debentures and warrant derivatives. We elected to record the $4.0 million secured convertible debentures issued in December 2016 on their fair value basis and recorded a loss of $155,857 due to the change in their fair value as of March 31, 2017. Warrants to purchase 12,200 common shares remain unexercised at March 31, 2017 and 2016, which are treated as derivative liabilities, and we recorded income of $605 due to the change in their fair value as of March 31, 2017.Interest expense totaled $80,551 in the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $755 in the three months ended March 31, 2016. We issued an aggregate of $4.0 million principal amount of secured convertible debentures on December 30, 2016 which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum and remained outstanding at March 31, 2017. No similar interest bearing debt was outstanding during the 2016 period. We reported a net loss of ($2,032,955), or ($0.36) per share, in the first quarter of 2017, compared with a prior-year net loss of ($2,313,125), or ($0.44) per share. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in the first quarter of either 2017 or 2016. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry forwards, until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize such assets. During first quarter 2017, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by approximately $715,000. As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $41.7 million of net operating loss carryforwards and $2.0 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available to offset future net taxable income. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported an adjusted net loss (before depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, change in derivative liabilities, change in the fair value of secured convertible notes, secured convertible debentures issuance expense, and stock-based compensation), of ($1,256,544), or ($0.22) per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, versus a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of ($1,760,047), or ($0.34) per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016. (Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is described in greater detail in a table at the end of this press release).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresDigital Ally, Inc. has provided financial information in this release that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information includes non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss. Digital Ally uses such non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Digital Ally's ongoing operational performance. Digital Ally believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in Digital Ally's industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. As noted, the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above exclude certain non-cash and/or non-recurring expenses/income including: (1) depreciation and amortization expense, (2) net interest expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) changes in fair value of secured convertible notes payable, (5) secured convertible debentures issuance expense, (6) and changes in warrant derivative valuations.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above. As previously mentioned, a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables included as part of this press release.Investor Conference CallThe Company will host an investor conference call at 11:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on Monday, May 15, 2017, to discuss its operating results for the first quarter 2017, along with other topics of interest. Shareholders and other interested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing 844-761-0863 and entering conference ID# 18527706 a few minutes before 11:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Monday, May 15, 2017. A replay of the conference call will be available two hours after its completion, from May 15, 2017 until 11:59 p.m. on August 15, 2017 by dialing 855-859-2056 and entering the conference ID# 18527706.About Digital Ally, Inc.Digital Ally, Inc. develops, manufactures and markets advanced technology products for law enforcement, homeland security and commercial applications.

Announces 2016 Operating ResultsMarketwiredMarch 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLENEXA, KS--(Marketwired - Mar 27, 2017) - Digital Ally, Inc. (  NASDAQ :  DGLY ), which develops, manufactures and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement, homeland security and commercial applications, today announced its operating results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT tomorrow, March 28 2017 (see details below).Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2016 We expanded our addressable market outside of law enforcement with the award of several large orders involving our in-car event recorder and body camera products to non-law enforcement customers during 2016. These orders demonstrate the importance of our solution to meet customer demands and our flexibility to adapt our hardware and software to handle unique requirements for a variety of industries and applications.  We introduced several new cloud-based and other recurring service offerings to our product suite, including our revamped VuVault.com cloud storage service to law enforcement customers and the FleetVU Manager, our driver management, training and asset tracking cloud systems for non-law enforcement customers. Our FleetVu Manager users are able to manage and monitor their fleet drivers using their own customized and defined feedback parameters, such as speed, hard braking, geo-fencing and erratic turns, all of which are automatically uploaded to FleetVuManager.com without having to manually sort through hours of recorded video events. These recurring revenue services generate more predictable and stable revenue streams for us. Service and other revenues increased 35% during 2016 compared with 2015.   We recently released our new DVM-800 HD in-car video system, which provides the first full HD quality in-car video system available on the market. The DVM-800 HD is the new standard in high definition 1080p in-car video systems for law enforcement and is gaining the attention of our customers and potential customers because of its advanced features at an attractive price point.   During 2016 we were awarded a contract for the sale of FirstVu HD body-worn cameras to a non-law enforcement international customer. The three-year supply contract includes our FirstVu HD body-worn cameras, storage systems and an extended service agreement. The revenue from the initial orders delivered in 2016 exceeded $760,000 with additional service revenues of $180,000 expected for 2017 through 2019. Our international revenues increased to $1,191,012, representing 7% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $148,667, representing 1% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2015.   In December 2016, we completed a private placement of $4.0 million in principal amount of 8% secured convertible debentures and warrants exercisable to purchase 800,000 shares of common stock at $5.00 per share to two institutional investors. This private placement resulted in gross proceeds of $4.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction which totaled $281,570. We are using the net proceeds for general working capital purposes and to continue to execute our business plan.  During 2016 we filed patent infringement lawsuits against two competitors, Taser International, Inc. and Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a as WatchGuard Video. We have alleged that these competitors are infringing on our patented "auto-activation" feature embodied in our VuLink product. We believe that our patented auto activation feature is becoming an industry standard required in a majority of competitive bids to supply body cameras to law enforcement customers. Law enforcement agencies across the country have recognized the ground-breaking nature of our "auto-activation" patents and are demanding this technology. We believe that Taser and WatchGuard have grown their market shares on the back of our innovations because they were unable to develop their own solutions. We will continue to aggressively pursue our claims that Taser and WatchGuard have willfully infringed our patents. Further, we believe that the outcome of this litigation will generally set the competitive landscape for body-worn cameras utilized by law enforcement agencies for the foreseeable future.  During 2016, we encountered excessive rework costs for our products due to nonrecurring supply chain issues with certain of our contract manufacturers. The supply chain issues have been corrected; however, the effects of these issues impacted our revenues and gross margins for 2016. Total revenue decreased by 17% to approximately $16.6 million in 2016, compared with approximately $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit margin decreased to 32% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 42% in 2015.   The Company reported an operating loss of ($12,486,188) for the full year of 2016 compared with an operating loss of ($7,621,471) in the previous year. Operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 was ($4,013,995) compared with ($2,700,529) in the prior-year period.   A net loss of ($12,710,688), or ($2.38) per share, was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a net loss of ($12,037,892), or ($2.77) per share, in 2015.   On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded an adjusted net loss of ($10,273,557), or ($1.92) per share, in 2016 compared with a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of ($5,448,791), or ($1.26) per share in the year ended December 31, 2015.   Management Comments"We were disappointed to report revenues for the year ended 2016 that decreased 17% from the year prior, even though we saw an increase in our service-based revenues in 2016," stated Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally Inc. "We are concentrating on expanding our recurring service-based revenue to help stabilize and grow our revenues on a quarterly basis. We are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers. If successful, we believe that these new market channels could yield increased recurring service revenues for us in 2017 and beyond. We are testing a new revenue model that bundles our product offerings, including the long-term lease of our body-worn and/or in-car audio/video hardware, together with a monthly subscription for our cloud storage, search and archiving services for the underlying audio and video material. We believe this revenue service model may appeal to our customers, in particular our commercial and other non-law enforcement customers because it reduces the capital outlay up front and eliminates repairs and maintenance in exchange for level monthly payments for the utilization of the equipment, data storage and management services." "We recently announced the launch of the DVM-800 HD in-car video system, which we believe will be disruptive in the market and will lead to an expansion of our overall market share in the law enforcement channel. The DVM-800 HD system provides full 1080P high definition video at a cost effective price point, which is a competitive market advantage for us.""Our international revenues increased to $1,191,012 in 2016 compared to $148,667 during 2015 and were aided by approximately $760,000 of revenue from the sale our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems and extended service agreement to a non-law enforcement international customer that will continue for three years. This order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our FirstVU HD body cameras globally across various industries and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement market.""We entered 2017 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity, which should be able to support a higher level of product sales and shipments if anticipated orders are forthcoming," added Ross. "Unrestricted cash and equivalents totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2016, and we had approximately $11.7 million in net working capital available at the end of 2016, including $2.5 million of accounts receivable and $9.6 million of inventory. Our goal is to reduce inventory levels during 2017 to provide additional funding for operations," concluded Ross.2016 Operating Results For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total revenue decreased by 17% to approximately $16.6 million, compared with revenue of approximately $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. We attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by Taser's misleading press release regarding our patents, the reexamination of our patent commenced by Taser with the USPTO and our product quality control issues with our FirstVU HD product. In addition, we believe that Taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical and unfair competition. We expect FirstVU HD sales to recover during 2017 as we prosecute the patent lawsuits against Taser, WatchGuard and others and resolve our product quality issues. We believe the VuLink product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented "auto-activation" technology.International revenue increased to $1,191,012 in 2016, versus $148,667 in 2015. Our 2016 revenues were aided by approximately $760,000 of revenue generated by an order from a non-law enforcement international customer for our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems and extended service agreement. Gross profit declined 37% to $5,301,233 in 2016, versus $8,349,355 in 2015. Our gross margin decline is commensurate with the 17% decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to 68% from 58% for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that gross margins will improve in 2017 because we have corrected the workmanship and other issues affecting our FirstVU HD product during recent quarters, including the PCB contamination issue addressed in the second and third quarters 2016. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800, DVM-800 HD and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial market penetration in 2017. In addition, as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.Read MoreSelling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased approximately 11% to $17,787,421 in 2016, versus $15,970,826 a year earlier. Research and development costs increased 7% to $3,186,137 in 2016 compared with $2,980,807 in 2015. We are increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our offerings to include, among other items, cloud-based evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU Manager). We have several active new projects in development, along with multiple upgrades to our existing products. Selling, advertising and promotional expense rose 7% to $4,238,895, compared with $3,965,400 in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to our becoming the title sponsor in 2015 of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Our net promotional expense related to the 2016 tournament was $499,313 compared with $172,623 for the 2015 tournament, an increase of $326,690. Professional fees and related expenses rose 41% to $1,930,625 last year, compared with $1,368,758 a year earlier. The increase in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to higher litigation expenses related to the Utility, Taser, and WatchGuard lawsuits. We expect litigation expense to trend higher during 2017 as we commence the jury trial in the Utility lawsuit and discovery activities in the Taser and WatchGuard lawsuits. We intend to pursue recovery from Utility, Taser, WatchGuard, their insurers and other responsible parties as appropriate. Executive, support and administrative staff payroll expenses increased to $4,115,816 in the most recent year, compared with $2,941,151 a year earlier. This increase is attributable to hiring additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded. Further, we required additional technical and marketing support for our newer products, such as the DVM-800 HD, VuLink and FirstVU HD and, in particular, the new cloud-based VuVault.net and FleetVU Manager service-based products. Executive payroll increased over prior year levels as key employees and certain executives received raises or bonuses after several years of salaries being frozen.We reported an operating loss of ($12,486,188) for 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($7,621,471) in the previous year.Interest income increased to $26,195 in the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $21,156 a year earlier. Non-cash income totaled $33,977 in 2016 to reflect changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives. Non-cash charges of $4,063,377 were incurred in 2015 to reflect changes in fair value of the note payable and derivatives associated with the conversion of the secured convertible note into common stock and the exercise of associated warrants, along with fair value of the note payable and derivatives.Because we elected to account for and record our secured convertible debentures on a fair value basis, we were required to expense certain related issuance costs to "other expense" during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Such costs totaled $281,570 and $93,845 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Other income was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2016 versus $1,878 in 2015.Interest expense totaled $3,102 in 2016, compared to $282,233 in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our reduced indebtedness throughout 2016. We reported a 2016 net loss of ($12,710,688), or ($2.38) per share, compared with a prior-year net loss of ($12,037,892), or ($2.77) per share. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in either 2016 or 2015. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry forwards, until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize such assets. During 2016, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by approximately $4.4 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $40.1 million of net operating loss carryforwards and $2.0 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available to offset future net taxable income. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported an adjusted net loss (before depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, change in derivative liabilities, change in the fair value of secured convertible notes, secured convertible debentures issuance expense, and stock-based compensation), of ($10,273,557), or ($1.92) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of ($5,448,791), or ($1.26) per diluted share, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. (Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is described in greater detail in a table at the end of this press release).Fourth Quarter Operating ResultsFor the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, our total revenue decreased 32% to approximately $3.4 million, compared with revenue of approximately $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. We believe our revenues in the fourth quarter 2016 continued to be negatively impacted by Taser's misleading press release, the reexamination of our patent commenced by Taser with the USPTO and our product quality control issues.Gross profit was $148,807 (4% of revenue) in the fourth quarter 2016, versus $1,563,647 (31% of revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter 2016, we scrapped approximately $570,000 of inventory, most of which related to our FirstVU HD product and its product quality issues. We also increased our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $485,000 in fourth quarter 2016 due to the implementation of newer versions of PCB components, making previous versions excess or obsolete and higher levels of used or trade-in inventory and items requiring refurbishment.Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased 2% to $4,162,802 in the final quarter of 2016, versus $4,264,176 a year earlier. Research and development costs increased 14% to $833,056 in the most recent quarter, compared with $732,944 in 2015. Selling, advertising and promotional expenses decreased 7% in the final quarter of 2016 to $943,152 versus $1,013,609 a year earlier. Stock-based compensation expense decreased 29% to $389,053, compared with $545,548 in the year-earlier period due primarily to the increased amortization of restricted stock granted in 2015 to our officers, directors and other employees due to their grant date fair value. General and administrative expense increased 1% to $1,997,541, compared with $1,972,075 in the corresponding period of the previous year.Our operating loss was ($4,013,995) for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($2,700,529) in the fourth quarter of 2015.Interest income decreased to $4,092 in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, versus $8,583 in the year-earlier quarter. We reported non-cash income of $15,237 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with non-cash charges totaling ($422) in the year-earlier quarter. Such non-cash income (charges) reflects changes in fair value of the warrant derivatives associated with the senior convertible notes payable. Warrants to purchase 12,200 common shares remain unexercised at December 31, 2016 and 2015 which are treated as derivative liabilities.Interest expense totaled $664 and $1,261 during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to our reduced indebtedness throughout 2016.We elected to account for and record our $4.0 million secured convertible debentures issued in December 2016 on its fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to expense the related issuance costs of $281,570 to other expense in the consolidated statement of operations in fourth quarter 2016. There were no similar debt issuance costs for fourth quarter 2015.We reported a net loss of ($4,276,900), or ($0.80) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of ($2,693,629), or ($0.53) per share, in the prior-year period. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of either 2016 or 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss (earnings/loss before, depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, changes in derivative liabilities, losses on the conversion of secured convertible notes payable, secured convertible note issuance expenses, and stock-based compensation), of ($3,481,399), or ($0.63) per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, versus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ($2,024,810), or ($0.40), in the three months ended December 31, 2015. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Digital Ally, Inc. has provided financial information in this release that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

That goes for small agencies and large agencies alike. Here are some solutions.

However, body cams are not the silver bullet. There are downsides, and there will be a learning curve. This series of articles will tackle them all. Read Article Related Products Digital Ally In-Car Video System Released by Digital Ally Inc in May 2012    		Digital Ally, Inc. announced that all new orders of the DVM-500Plus In-Car Video System will now include the VoiceVault™ Advanced Wireless Microphone at no additional cost to the customer. Previously only available with the DVM-750 In-Car Video System, the VoiceVault offers the same extended range, voice optimization and noise filtering, and fully digital audio transmission with true frequency hopping technology as the previous DVM-500Plus system’s mic. However, it also offers the industry-first feature of recording up to two hours of audio evidence onto On-Board Solid State Memory when the mic is out of range or the signal to the in-car video system is interrupted. The VoiceVault also records its own metadata to later link with recordings from the in-car video system for the same incidents when loaded into Digital Ally’s VideoManager software.		 Web: http://www.digitalallyinc.com  DVM-750 Released by Digital Ally Inc in November 2011    		At this year’s IACP Conference, Digital Ally, Inc. is introducing new software that allows a MDT or MDC to control the DVM-750 In-Car Video System. The MDC-750 Interface Software provides full control of the DVM-750 In-Car Video System via Touch Screen (easy to use, graphical on-screen buttons) or Keyboard Interface. This includes user and password entry, recording, audio controls, camera selection, zooming, event marking, playback, metadata display, menu access, and more. If the MDT/MDC running the application fails or the cable to the DVM-750 is unplugged, the video system buttons will become active to allow normal operation.		 Web: http://www.digitalallyinc.com/  Digital Ally DVM-750 In-Car Video System Released by Digital Ally Inc in May 2011    		DVM-750 In-Car Video Systems can now be updated and configured wirelessly. Customers may use a laptop/MDC or compact module for wireless transfer. Interactive maps of routes travelled in the recordings are also now available in VideoManagerII.		 Web: http://www.digitalallyinc.com  Digital Ally VideoManager Software Released by Digital Ally Inc in April 2011    		Digital Ally added a new tool to its VideoManager software to track the location of video taken with its GPS-enabled units. It now includes a feature that utilizes an in-program overhead map to view routes traversed in videos along with the location of "marked" events. This feature gives officers an easy-to-read interface for pinpointing the location of where recorded video was created.		 Web: http://www.digitalallyinc.com  Digital Ally VoiceVault MIC Released by Digital Ally Inc in October 2010    		Digital Ally’s VoiceVault™ MIC includes industry-first features like On-Board Memory to record when out of the 1-mile max range. An earpiece allows officer communication or listening to suspects. It includes integrated GPS with event marking, it embeds coordinates and date / time stamp, it has an emergency call feature and more.		 Web: http://www.digitalallyinc.com
