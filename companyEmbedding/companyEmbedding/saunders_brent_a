“This acquisition creates the fastest growing and most dynamic growth pharmaceutical company in global healthcare, making us one of the world’s top 10 pharmaceutical companies,” said Brent Saunders, CEO and President of Actavis. “We will establish an unrivaled foundation for long-term growth, anchored by leading, world-class blockbuster franchises and a premier late-stage pipeline that will accelerate our commitment to build an exceptional, sustainable portfolio.  The combined company will have a strong balance sheet, growing product portfolios and broad commercial reach extending across 100 international markets.  Our combined experienced management team is dedicated to driving strong organic growth while capturing synergies and maintaining a robust investment in strategically focused R&D. 
“This is a financially compelling transaction. With pro forma revenues in excess of $23 billion anticipated in 2015, this combination doubles the revenue generated by our brands business and doubles the international revenue of the combined company.  Management is committed to maximizing the potential for the combined company to drive industry-leading top and bottom line growth. With this combination, we plan to transform the growth profile of our pharmaceutical business and have the ability to generate organic revenue growth at a compound annual growth rate of at least 10 percent for the foreseeable future,” added Saunders. “The combination is expected to generate strong free cash flow of more than $8 billion in 2016 and substantial growth thereafter, which will enable the rapid repayment of debt. We expect that the combination will result in double-digit accretion to non-GAAP earnings within the first 12 months.”
“Today’s transaction provides Allergan stockholders with substantial and immediate value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company,” said David E. I. Pyott, Chairman and CEO of Allergan.  “We are combining with a partner that is ideally suited to realize the full potential inherent in our franchise.  Together with Actavis, we are poised to extend the Allergan growth story as part of a larger organization with a broad and balanced portfolio, a meaningful commitment to research and development, a strong pipeline and an unwavering focus on exceeding the expectations of patients and the medical specialists who treat them.  I am thankful for the hard work and dedication of our employees, and I’m confident they will make many valuable contributions to the combined company.  Looking to the immediate future, all of us at Allergan are excited to roll up our sleeves and work closely with the Actavis team to ensure a smooth transition.”  
“This combination will greatly enhance our U.S. and international commercial opportunities,” said Paul Bisaro, Executive Chairman of Actavis.  “In the U.S., the combination makes us more relevant to an even broader group of physicians and customers. Overseas, it will enhance our commercial position, expand our portfolio and broaden our footprint in Canada, Europe and Southeast Asia and other high-value growth markets, including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.”  
  The combined company will be led by Brent Saunders, CEO and President of Actavis, and Paul Bisaro will remain Executive Chairman of the Board. The integration of the two companies will be led by the senior management teams of both companies, with integration planning to begin immediately in order to transition rapidly to a single company.  Additionally, two members of the Allergan Board of Directors will be invited to join the Actavis Board of Directors following the completion of the transaction.

Financially Compelling Transaction

The growth profile of the combined pharmaceutical business will be unparalleled in the industry with the ability for double-digit revenue and earnings growth while maintaining investments to grow and develop our product portfolios and pipeline. The addition of Allergan’s portfolio, including multiple blockbuster therapeutic franchises, doubles the revenues of Actavis’ North American Specialty Brands business.  On a pro forma basis for full year 2015, the combined company will have three blockbuster franchises each with annual revenues in excess of $3 billion in Ophthalmology, Neurosciences/CNS and Medical Aesthetics/Dermatology/Plastic Surgery. The specialty product franchises in Gastroenterology, Cardiovascular, Women’s Health, Urology and Infectious Disease treatments will have combined revenues of approximately $4 billion. 
Actavis projects that the transaction will generate at least $1.8 billion in annual synergies commencing in 2016, in addition to the $475 million of annual savings previously announced by Allergan in connection with Project Endurance.  Actavis also plans to maintain annual R&D investment of approximately $1.7 billion, ensuring the appropriate resource allocation to continue driving exceptional organic growth.  

Significantly Expanded Brand Pharmaceutical Portfolio Supported by a World-Class North American Sales and Marketing Organization


Allergan’s blockbuster franchises in Ophthalmology, Neurosciences, and Medical Aesthetics/Dermatology/Plastic Surgery will complement Actavis’ existing blockbuster CNS, Gastroenterology and Women’s Health franchises to create a leading portfolio across a broad range of therapeutic areas.


The companies’ combined U.S. sales force will have extraordinary marketing reach and increased relevance with more than a dozen medical specialists, including primary care physicians, ophthalmologists, optometrists, dermatologists, aesthetic physicians, plastic surgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, infectious disease specialists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, OB-GYNs and urologists. 


Expanded Commercial Opportunities Across Global Markets


The combination of Actavis and Allergan will greatly enhance international commercial opportunities by positioning the combined company to extend its blockbuster franchise strategy on a global scale.


The company will have approximately $5 billion in pro forma 2015 international revenue.


Together Actavis and Allergan will have a commercial presence across 100 markets, including an enhanced presence across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America and a strong footprint in China and India. 


The combined company will benefit from Allergan’s global brand equity, industry-leading consumer marketing capabilities and strong consumer awareness of key Allergan products, including BOTOX®. 


The combined company will have the unique opportunity to drive growth in international markets through its enhanced portfolio of brands, generics, branded-generic and over-the-counter products.

 
Expanded Pharmaceutical R&D Pipeline


The combined company will provide a strong commitment to R&D, with an exceptional level of annual investment of approximately $1.7 billion, focused on the strategic development of innovative and durable value-enhancing products within brands, generics, biologics and OTC portfolios. 


The combination is expected to add approximately 15 projects in near- and mid-term development to Actavis’ robust development portfolio.

Meet Brent Saunders, the Lehigh Valley's $150 billion dealmaker




The largest deal in Israeli corporate history was hatched over lunch in the richly textured dining room of 3 West, a New American-style restaurant in Somerset County, New Jersey.There, Brent Saunders, CEO of Botox-maker Allergan, met for 2 1/2 hours with two executives from generic drugmaker Teva who wanted to own Allergan's generic drug business. Saunders had rejected previous approaches by Teva, but this time around, the price was high enough."They had rethought the value of our business and had a new valuation, a higher valuation than they had before," Saunders said. "I remember thinking their logic was sound."Negotiations ensued in the days ahead and the deal was announced two weeks later, on July 27, with Israel-based Teva agreeing to pay $40.5 billion — the 10th-largest pharmaceutical transaction in history, according to data provider Dealogic.

Long before Saunders cemented his reputation as one of the biggest dealmakers in the pharmaceutical industry, he was a 13-year-old business owner cutting lawns in the South Whitehall Township neighborhood where he grew up.S&S Landscaping, as it came to be known, started off simply enough, with Saunders and his two business partners — his identical twin brother, Wayne, and a neighbor — doing lawn chores for a few neighbors. But the brothers always took it to the extreme.On snowy days, they traded their push mowers for snow shovels, rising at 5 a.m. to clear customers' driveways. Eventually, the business expanded into landscaping, collecting a few employees (fellow neighborhood boys) and more than 50 clients along the way. The business even had a company car: a 1975 Chevy wood-paneled station wagon with 100,000 miles on it.With their earnings, the brothers saved for college, funded ski trips and even bought a Trans Am. Before college, they flipped the business to a professional landscaper for a few thousand dollars.














PHOTO GALLERY: At 45, Lehigh Valley native Brent Saunders is one of biggest stars in the pharma industry.



"I think success breeds future success," said Saunders, a 1988 Parkland High School graduate who was inducted into the school's Wall of Honor in 2013. "It's just something that you develop skills in terms of managing customers and leading people and taking great pride in what you do."Now 45, Saunders is no longer pushing mowers in the Lehigh Valley. He has rocketed to fame in the pharmaceutical industry through a string of blockbuster deals over the last 51/2 years, selling two companies for a combined $37 billion and acquiring another for $70.5 billion. And that's not including the Teva deal.Since 2010, he has put together deals for a combined $150 billion."We applaud Brent Saunders, who, in less than six months [as CEO], has helped to bring about in my opinion one of the best pharma mergers in the last decade," legendary investor Carl Icahn said in a statement following the $28 billion sale in 2014 of one pharmaceutical company, New York-based Forest Laboratories.A February cover of Forbes dubbed Saunders "Wall Street's Drug Dealer," painting him as a leader who prioritizes shareholder value over inventing new drugs.At Allergan, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, for tax reasons but operating in Parsippany, N.J., Saunders is transforming the company into a leader in what he calls "growth pharma." In the second quarter, sales increased for 12 of the company's top 15 global brands, which include anti-wrinkle treatment Botox, chronic dry eye drug Restasis and high blood pressure tablet Bystolic. The company expects revenues of about $15 billion this year.The Teva deal, expected to close in the first quarter next year, will reload Allergan's balance sheet, and Saunders soon will have the firepower for another big deal.It's likely he won't waste much time. Despite his eight-figure compensation last year, he rarely goes on vacation and detests quiet time. Colleagues of past and present say his self-awareness, drive and intelligence make him an effective leader — though Saunders struggles to explain why he's drawn to such roles."I don't know. I often think about that," he said. "I tend to believe that if I'm going to be involved in something, I want to give it my all. ... If I'm in, I'm all in. And, if I'm all in, I try to bring my best, which in many cases, winds up being the leader of the activity."He's largely avoided controversy to this point, though last year, the New York attorney general filed suit against Actavis, later renamed Allergan, for its effort to convert patients from an older Alzheimer's drug to a newer, pricier version before generic competition moved in. After a federal judge ruled against the company, it immediately appealed — ultimately to no avail.Despite Saunders' local ties, his visibility on cable TV — he's a regular on CNBC's "Mad Money" — and stature in the pharmaceutical industry, many Lehigh Valley business leaders have never heard of him. While Saunders is involved in supporting his family's charity work at St. Luke's University Health Network and Allergan has a small sales office in Center Valley, he lives and works in New Jersey."Sometimes these type of folks fly under the radar," said Don Cunningham, president and CEO of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp.In 20 years, Saunders has tackled overbilling issues at teaching hospitals, rooted out bad practices at Schering-Plough and, in just the last few years, made his case for being one of the nation's top young CEOs.

Early entrepreneurWhen Brent and Wayne Saunders were in Jewish Day School in South Whitehall — roughly 6 or 7 years old — their father, Charles Saunders, got a glimpse of one of their first business enterprises.One day, when it was a little too quiet upstairs, Charles checked on the twins to see what was going on. He found the boys diligently at work in the bathroom, shaving soap and melting it in the sink with hot water."They were going to make shampoo and put it in bottles and go around the neighborhood and try to sell it," recalled Charles Saunders, a retired urologist who now chairs St. Luke's board of trustees.Charles and his wife, Sheila, who co-founded Senior Solutions, the Lehigh Valley's first geriatric-care management agency, raised their three children — Brent, Wayne and daughter Reed — on Cedarwood Road in South Whitehall. While the children received everything they needed, their parents also instilled a strong work ethic in them. Growing up, if they wanted something extra — like expensive clothes or a car — they had to work for it.

Before they could use real money, the twins (Brent is about seven or eight minutes older than Wayne) set up a barter system in the family's basement, collecting and exchanging goods. At age 11 or 12, they had a bike-repair shop in their family's garage. They fixed flat tires and bike chains, and built their own BMX bikes.Other childhood ventures included a backyard volleyball court, where they charged $5 a head, a record store that never quite came to fruition and a six-member rock band called Axtion, with Brent on rhythm guitar and Wayne on the synthesizer.While the band was not successful, older sister Reed, a 1986 Parkland graduate who is now 47, said her brothers were always looking for the next deal."They were fearless," said Reed, who works at medical device-maker Smith & Nephew in Andover, Mass. "If they failed, it didn't even faze them. They would try pretty much anything, and they were resilient enough that if it didn't work out, they had four other ideas."Brent and Wayne also held some traditional jobs growing up, such as delivering The Morning Call and working at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom. The brothers also collected baseball cards, and Brent's collection remains intact in his childhood bedroom closet, with a vintage handwritten sign reading, "Do not touch."After Brent and Wayne sold the landscaping business, they worked jobs at Mayflower Moving off Emmaus Avenue, loading everything from pianos to couches to refrigerators into trucks.Wayne, owner of the Center for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery at St. Luke's, called the job a tipping point, getting the brothers to realize: "Hey, we want to use our minds and not our bodies."In college, they launched yet another business. Their grandfather, a podiatrist, passed down his "secret sauce" formula for ingrown toenails. So the brothers formed a small LLC and patented the formula, achieving moderate success with Nail EZ through direct mail.

Going 'all in'Brent Saunders received a bachelor's degree in economics and East Asian studies from the University of Pittsburgh in 1992, but he was more focused on learning outside the classroom. As president of the Student Government Board, Saunders managed an office with a multimillion-dollar budget and about 30 staff members and volunteers."The more he could be involved in, the better off he was, whether it was his fraternity or Greek Week or student government," said fellow Pitt grad Gil Borok, deputy CFO and chief accounting officer at CBRE and a close friend of Saunders. "He did all of those things that you'd say, 'Well, boy, this guy's going to be successful.' "Saunders, who spent eight weeks in Israel during a summer break in high school, also did a summer semester in Tokyo as part of a study abroad program with Pitt and Seikei University. There, he lived with a Japanese family and immersed himself in the foreign lifestyle."If you're going to do something, you should go all in," Saunders said. "So I really wanted to try to have the deepest experience in understanding international culture and, ultimately, international business."After receiving a law degree and MBA from Temple University in 1996, Saunders had an important decision to make: continue as a lawyer and become a partner one day, or do something radical.He chose to separate from the pack.Saunders began his career in compliance in 1996 for the Thomas Jefferson University Health System in Philadelphia, where he had worked part time during law school. At the time, federal prosecutors had started investigating expenses at teaching hospitals, a probe that would expand in the years ahead. Saunders worked with the federal government and instituted a compliance program, which saved Jefferson $6 million when its penalty was handed down.In 2000, Saunders joined PricewaterhouseCoopers, focusing on compliance in health care and quickly rising to partner and head of the firm's compliance business advisory services group. While there, he caught the attention of Fred Hassan.Hassan, hired as CEO of Kenilworth, N.J., pharmaceutical company Schering-Plough in April 2003, was tasked with turning around a company that saw its stock drop more than 50 percent in the prior two years. The tumble came after it agreed to pay a $500 million fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for repeated manufacturing lapses. It also faced investigations into a kickback it paid to a health insurer and the marketing of its drugs for unapproved uses, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.So Hassan looked for an outsider with a new mindset who would help clean up the situation he inherited.He had three candidates: Saunders, then 33, and two others with more experience. Hassan chose Saunders, and the company announced his appointment as senior vice president of global compliance and business practices Oct. 9, 2003."Now as I reflect back, I've not been 100 percent on my selections, but that one was one of the best that I made at that time," Hassan said. "[Saunders] just went on and on after that."It took a few years for Saunders to resolve the legal issues that plagued the company, negotiating at least $780 million in settlements with the federal government between July 2004 and August 2006, according to the Justice Department.With compliance now in good shape, Saunders' career made its biggest shift: He became president of consumer health care at Schering-Plough in mid-2007, now responsible for a business unit of products including Coppertone, Dr. Scholl's and Claritin."That changed the trajectory or the focus of which way I was going to go career-wise," said Saunders, who implemented a growth strategy in the business unit that included expansion into international markets.Later in 2007, his job took him to the Netherlands. Hassan had tasked Saunders with integrating Dutch biotech group Organon BioSciences, which Schering-Plough bought for $14.4 billion. While it was a complicated task, Saunders successfully completed it and once again proved to his mentor he was ready for the next challenge.So when Merck & Co. bought Schering-Plough in 2009 for $41 billion, Schering-Plough chose Saunders to lead its integration team.

Tom Colligan, a Schering-Plough board member from 2005 to 2009, said Organon and Merck gave Saunders a deep understanding of the work left after a mega-deal is announced — a skill that would come in handy down the road."When he does deals, he understands what happens the day after the deal is done," said Colligan, who was vice chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers while Saunders was there.A star is bornIt was Saunders' old boss, Hassan, now at private equity firm Warburg Pincus, who helped him land his first CEO gig in March 2010 at eye-health company Bausch & Lomb. There, Saunders established himself as a rising star in the pharmaceutical industry.Warburg Pincus acquired Bausch & Lomb in 2007 for about $4.5 billion after the FDA reported the company's flagship contact lens solution caused eye infections. Saunders — as the company's third CEO in four years — was put in charge of a 157-year-old company that hadn't grown in decades.Saunders considers his first year at Bausch & Lomb the toughest job he's had so far. In addition to the skepticism surrounding him as a first-time CEO, he said the company had lost its way with product innovation and its employees were demoralized."There were plenty of people who stood up at a podium on their first day and said, 'I have the plan to change this company,' only to not be there a year later," Saunders said. "And so, what I quickly determined in my first 24 hours there was that no speech was going to change the course of this company."Determined to "lead through action," Saunders spent a lot of time flying around the world to meet with customers as he tried to rebuild the company's team, morale and strategy. Eighteen-hour days were the norm during his first three months at Bausch & Lomb, a work schedule that only calmed slightly in the months ahead."It was a crazy year," Saunders said.By March 2013, when Bausch & Lomb filed for an initial public offering, the company under Saunders' leadership had introduced 30 new products since 2010, had 35 products at various stages of development in its pipeline and grew sales at an annualized 9 percent for the two years ended December 2012, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.During the IPO roadshow in late May, Saunders had just fallen asleep in his New York hotel on the Wednesday before Memorial Day weekend when he got a late-night call from J. Michael Pearson, CEO of Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Pearson was interested in buying Bausch & Lomb.Saunders canceled his Memorial Day weekend vacation plans and spent those days orchestrating the deal with Valeant. The $8.7 billion sale was announced days later.Saunders — a guy who gets antsy after a day with nothing to do — was then left jobless and eager for his next post.In September 2013, he was named CEO of Forest Laboratories Inc., where he'd been a director since August 2011. He replaced Howard Solomon, who had been the target of public criticism from billionaire Icahn, a major shareholder in Forest.In mid-January 2014, Saunders and Paul Bisaro, president and CEO of pharmaceutical company Actavis, discussed industry trends over dinner at a health care conference in San Francisco. Before long, the conversation shifted to each company's strengths and weaknesses, and combining started to make more sense.And Feb. 18, 2014 — about five months after Saunders took the Forest Labs job — Actavis said it was acquiring Forest, a deal that closed at $28 billion.The original plan was for Bisaro to head the combined company. But as he continued to work with Saunders, plans changed."I now have the opportunity to land, I would arguably say, the best young CEO in the industry by far," Bisaro remembers thinking. "It just didn't make any sense to let him get away."In the Actavis cafeteria, Bisaro offered Saunders the CEO job. Saunders agreed, but only if Bisaro stayed with the company as executive chairman. Actavis made the appointments official July 1, 2014.Saunders had no shortage of work. Actavis kept its eye on Valeant's hostile-takeover bid for Botox-maker Allergan, an attempt supported by hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman.In the fall, Saunders called Allergan CEO David Pyott, with whom he competed while at Bausch & Lomb. As the takeover situation worsened, the two CEOs talked more and more. If Allergan needed a white knight, Saunders said, Actavis would listen.Actavis eventually beat out Valeant in the bidding war for Allergan in a transaction announced in November 2014, which closed at $70.5 billion, the year's biggest pharmaceutical deal and among the five largest on record.While the Allergan deal is Saunders' largest to date, he's not ready to declare a victory, as he believes a deal's success is measured in years — not months."I think it has all the makings of the most successful deal I've ever done six months into it, and certainly the most value-creating deal I've done six months into it, but it would be a question I'd rather answer in two or three years from now."While Actavis was widely viewed as the better option over Valeant, Allergan's southern California workforce was still hit hard, as nearly 600 employees were laid off in Irvine, leaving 2,100 workers there. In late June this year, by which point Actavis had adopted the Allergan name, Saunders said the cuts were done.In terms of consolidation, Saunders said there's pressure on the health care industry to contain costs and boost production, and he expects the integrations to continue moving forward."I think the industry is in the third inning of a nine-inning game in terms of consolidation," he said.Growth pharmaIf the Allergan deal hadn't already made it clear, the company made its transformation into a branded growth pharma leader even more obvious with the blockbuster Teva deal announced in July.The sale of its generic drug business gives Allergan an opportunity to simplify its business and invest in its seven therapeutic areas, including eye care, aesthetics and women's health.In the Teva announcement, Allergan said it would invest about $1.4 billion in research and development this year. While Saunders called drug discovery "critical," he said many drugs are discovered by small companies — not big pharma — and Allergan needs to spend its money where it adds value.

"We have almost 2,000 scientists in our company that work on drug development, and so we want to be best-in-class developers," Saunders said. "But we don't necessarily have to be discoverers."So Allergan has been buying commercial-ready assets and ones that need further development. Just since its name change, the company has announced several acquisitions: depression-treatment developer Naurex for $560 million, glaucoma treatment company AqueSys for $300 million, dry-eye disease treatment-maker Oculeve for $125 million and Kythera Biopharmaceuticals for $2.1 billion.Kythera, which developed a treatment for double chins, will shed 117 employees at the company's Westlake Village, Calif., headquarters come Nov. 30 as a result of the deal. Many of the workers, Saunders said, opted for the "rich severance packages" Kythera offered them and decided to find jobs elsewhere."It was hard to keep people. We did not want to fire that many people," he said.In addition to building a deep pipeline, Saunders is trying to create the "best company in our industry" by using the skills he developed during his rapid rise to the top — removing excess middle managers, getting to know frontline colleagues and surrounding himself with talent.Saunders is trying to create an entrepreneurial culture, encouraging employees to take risks and learn from their mistakes.While Saunders encourages employees to find their work-life balance, he acknowledges he's not the example to follow: His days start at 7 a.m. and end at 7 p.m., and he boards an airplane three or four times weekly. His schedule doesn't leave much time for hobbies, of which he says he has three: hanging out with his wife and two children, playing golf (not as much as Wayne wants him to) and squeezing in some Pitt basketball games.If he had 10 more minutes in the day, Saunders said, he would spend it with front-line colleagues. He hasn't turned on the iMac in his Parsippany office in at least a year, preferring phone or face-to-face contact for everything other than the quick email communication he does on his smartphone.He's also determined to get close to his company's products. At Bausch & Lomb, he wore contact lenses made with no vision correction — he had laser eye surgery before joining the company.Saunders is also a Botox user. In January, after the Allergan acquisition was announced and two months before the deal closed, he received a "fairly full treatment of Botox" on stage in front of 1,000 Allergan sales reps."My wife thought I looked a little better," he said.Analysts agree Saunders is a well-spoken and humble leader who is very responsive and strategic in what he's building at Allergan. Some say there's concern over how fast the transition is occurring, but so far Saunders has proved capable.But mostly, they're wondering, when will Saunders make his next blockbuster deal?Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said everyone has their speculations — such as Allergan's buying Irish biopharmaceutical company Shire or being scooped up by Pfizer — but Allergan has a knack for making moves nobody sees coming."There's going to be a lot of eyes on Brent Saunders, to be sure," Waterhouse said.As for Saunders, there's no endgame in sight, at least not one he will commit to yet. Money isn't the issue — just for the last six months of 2014, he collected total compensation valued at $36.6 million, according to SEC filings. He is trying to build something special at Allergan and believes his best days and biggest successes have yet to come."My hope is that Allergan is the last business card I have, the last company that I work for on a full-time basis," Saunders said. "But my hope is to be here about 15 years and try to retire when I get closer to 60."He paused five seconds, then said: "And by the way, when somebody asks me when I'm 60, I'll probably say 70 is the new 60."jon.harris@mcall.comTwitter @ByJonHarris610-820-6779BRENTON L.

You could say it comes with the territory: As CEO of
  Allergan, Brent Saunders once received Botox injections onstage.
  But at just 46, he already has fewer wrinkles than most leaders
  of pharmaceutical companies. His fast rise has been driven by
  dealmaking, and it was a deal by his previous company Actavis to
  buy Allergan, the maker of Botox and other drugs, that many say
  saved the company from falling into the hands of the troubled
  pharmaceutical firm Valeant. For our series, The Price of
  Profits, we 
  sat down with Saunders at the Business Insider office.


This interview has been edited for length and
  clarity.

Dan Bobkoff: Allergan has grown a lot in the
  last few years through a number of mergers and acquisitions.
  You're not calling Allergan "Big Pharma." You have a different
  term for it?

Brent Saunders: We like to think of ourselves as
  "Growth Pharma," and we've defined "Growth Pharma" as companies
  that invest in innovation but also have a strong top-line sales
  growth profile. And the reason that's important is that
  innovation is the lifeblood of our industry, and I think to
  really have sustained leadership in any therapeutic area you have
  to continue to innovate. That's what we do; that's the core of
  our business. Growth, on the other hand, goes to culture, and
  while many in our industry are focused on cost-cutting and
  downsizing, we want to be a growth-oriented company where we look
  to really drive leadership therapeutically, leadership globally,
  and invest in our brands, whether that be in science or sales and
  marketing.

Bobkoff: If you were to compare your company to,
  say, Merck — a big, old-line company — how are you different?

Saunders: I think that we're alike in many
  regards in that we have a deep respect for innovation and the
  role of R&D. I think we differ in how we approach it. And we
  tend to be a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more
  scrappy. We tend to be a little bit more action-oriented, not
  operating with lots of committees or bureaucracy but more
  individual accountability with a bias to action.

Bobkoff: And you do more acquisition than
  in-house development.

Saunders: Well, I don't think that's really the
  best way to think about it. We acquire intellectual property, or
  R&D assets, and then develop them in-house. We have about
  2,000 people in R&D, we spend about a billion and a half
  dollars a year on R&D. What we don't have are discovery labs.
  What I would tell you is the vast majority of the late-stage
  pipeline of Big Pharma, as we call it, comes from external
  innovation; they are sourcing most of those innovations from
  academia, from startups, from venture-backed companies and the
  like. We do the same thing; we just do it with the absence of
  being held to the capital structure of discovery laboratories.
  But nonetheless, innovation is the lifeblood of what we do.

  Insider


Bobkoff: Typically, at what point do you acquire
  the intellectual property? How far along is it in the
  development?

Saunders: We tend to look at it across the
  entire continuum. We tend to try to structure for risk, so if
  it's earlier-stage development, let's say, preclinical, we may do
  it in a partnership with a discovery-based company. If it's got
  proof of concept or early clinical results, let's say, from human
  testing, we may structure it as an option agreement, and allow
  the smaller, more focused company to bring it to a later stage of
  development. Phase 2 or 3, where we really have strong conviction
  around the science and the program, we will buy it outright and
  finish it ourselves.


The anti-Valeant

Bobkoff: Before you arrived, Valeant wanted to
  acquire Allergan. And they famously said that they wanted to
  slash all R&D. Is it fair to say that the merger you were
  part of was in response to that?

Saunders: It was. We (at Actavis) were what was
  called by many a white knight. We were a friendly solution for
  the old Allergan management team in large part I guess because of
  the hostile attack from Valeant and Pershing Square's Bill
  Ackman. And so when we stepped in, we looked at how we could
  actually support and grow the company, and a good example is old
  Allergan spent about $900 million in R&D, and we spent about
  a billion and a half ... so we've actually increased R&D
  expenditure. 


Stakeholders versus shareholders

Bobkoff: When you make decisions, what are your
  priorities? How do you decide which stakeholders to take into
  account and where to prioritize them?

Saunders: I really think about two or three
  constituents as the most important. And I think they all kind of
  work in harmony. One, we have our shareholders, and they have
  invested their capital in our company and we have to provide a
  return for them and hopefully above market, above industry
  average returns. We have patients, where we invest to improve
  their lives either through treatments for their disease or cure
  for their illness, and then we have our employees and communities
  that benefit when we do well by the other two constituents.

Bobkoff: So would you call yourself a more of a
  stakeholder-view person, versus the sort of shareholder-focused
  view?

Saunders: Well, I think they're actually very
  consistent. When we do well for patients, when we come up with
  innovation for an unmet need, when we can improve a patient's
  life by one of our treatments, our shareholders benefit. So I
  don't really view any disconnect between the two. If we do right
  by one, the other will do well.

Bobkoff: In 1952, George Merck — then the head
  of Merck & Co. — had this famous statement: "Medicine is for
  the patient, not for the profits. The profits follow." Do you
  also abide by that?

Saunders: I think that's fair. I think I would
  caveat that, though, and I'd say that doesn't mean you can spend
  money recklessly, right? and I think it's —

Bobkoff: What's recklessly?

Saunders: Well, I think that you have to make
  sure that you're investing the corporate resources in a
  significant way to support that goal for patients. You can get
  distracted and build a big skyscraper-type headquarters. A
  company I came from, Bausch & Lomb, did that in Rochester,
  and so I think that you have to always make sure that you think
  about the patient and the shareholder in the same context and if
  you do that, and you stay tight and focused, then they live in
  harmony, but they could easily diverge under the name of "we're
  doing right by patients."

Bobkoff: I get the sense that there's almost
  nostalgia from some people for the days of the big old companies
  with massive research labs that would discover drugs, and then
  one organization would bring it all the way to market through the
  FDA. Are those days over?

Saunders: I do think they're over, but I think
  that's, frankly, a good thing given the time we're in. The
  science of human health has exploded, in part because of the
  human genome, in part because of biology and chemistry and how
  they play together, and it is too expensive and too complicated
  for any one company to corner all the great ideas that lead to
  drug discovery.


  And so the ecosystem, if you will, of inventors, of scientists,
  of academia, and the like, is far larger than one company could
  ever recreate. We'd rather support that ecosystem, and encourage
  that ecosystem to take on the higher-risk, early, tough science
  and let us step in where we can really bring expertise as a
  pharmaceutical company. And that can be in clinical development,
  that could be in pharmaceutical science, that could be in
  regulatory affairs, and certainly commercial capabilities, and
  really have a specialization of best interest, to really make
  sure that those investments pay off so that more people want to
  go into science and invest in taking on those high-risk projects.

Botox

Bobkoff: Now, before the mergers, there was this
  idea that Botox is your pipeline in a vial. There are so many
  uses, and more in development. Is that still the case?

Saunders: Well, yeah, I do think Botox is still
  a pipeline in a product, is what I like to call it, and if you
  think about it, Botox has been around for about 10 years — we
  have 11 approved indications. We sell more Botox for therapeutic
  indications like migraine or spasticity or OAB [overactive
  bladder] than we do for wrinkles, and we're studying it for many
  other potential therapeutic benefits ... potentially depression,
  
  AFIB, and a whole host of other ones. And so we're probably
  not even halfway through understanding the role that Botox can
  play in therapeutic health as well as aesthetic medicine.

Bobkoff: How do you prepare for the day when at
  some point you will run out of uses for it?

Saunders: I'm not worried about it until we
  probably get to somewhere closer to 2030, so we have plenty of
  time and I don't spend a ton of time worrying about that risk.
  Many other risks, but not that one.


Icahn's influence?

Bobkoff: I was a little bit surprised to hear
  that you view your role as more of a stakeholder CEO. You have
  the shareholders, you have the workers, you have the community.
  Now you have Carl Icahn as a big investor, and if you look at
  what happened with 
  Apple, he really pushed buybacks and then got out pretty
  quickly. So how can you maintain that strategy, that view, when
  you have any kind of activist investor on board like that?

Saunders: Yeah, look, I view Carl as just one of
  many important shareholders at Allergan. We listen to all of our
  shareholders, activist and passive and long-term and short-term
  shareholders, because again we don't have a monopoly on all the
  best thinking. It's always good to hear different points of view.
  I think Carl's intention here is constructive. He is an investor.
  He is not looking to be an activist at Allergan, and so I welcome
  him and obviously he saw something I also saw, which is that our
  stock was undervalued, and that's why we have committed to a $10
  billion share buyback at the close of our Teva transaction,
  because our stock is an overwhelmingly great investment, in my
  humble opinion, and Carl, I guess, agrees.

Bobkoff: What is your relationship with Icahn?

Saunders: Well, you know, I met Carl by being in
  a slate of directors at first that were in opposition to his
  slate. We met in a bit of a professional conflict, but ultimately
  I became CEO of that company. I worked very closely with him. I
  think he was very constructive in advocating for succession
  planning and a few issues at Forest Labs, and I think it worked
  out well for all stakeholders.


  Shareholders certainly did well — we were able to fund our
  pipeline. In fact today we got one of the drugs approved from
  back in those days, so I think patients ultimately won, and
  employees are in a much stronger, more vibrant company today than
  they've ever been. So I welcome Carl, and I think he'll be a good
  long-term investor.

Bobkoff: Icahn's being friendly now, things are
  good, the stock is supposedly undervalued, but if anything goes
  wrong, can't you imagine a day when he becomes an activist? Isn't
  that who he is?

Saunders: Well, I think that's always something
  you worry about, and certainly at the flip of a switch he could
  change his mind and become an activist — and so could many other
  shareholders. Or he could just enter or any other activist could
  enter the stock if something went wrong, so I don't spend a lot
  of time worrying about that. Rather I stay focused on executing
  our strategy and making sure we operate our business to the best
  of our ability and from there, you know, good things generally do
  happen.

Bobkoff: So if in six months or a year Carl
  Icahn or somebody else comes to you and says, you know what,
  you're spending too much on R&D, give more to shareholders,
  do a huge buyback, will you say no?

Saunders: Well, I'd have to understand the
  facts. The one thing I'll say is that I would listen to them, and
  I'll listen to any shareholder, not just Carl, but it's unlikely
  that we would do that, given where we sit today. But if the
  circumstances were different, I'd want to understand why they
  think that, and I'd be open-minded about it, but we're going to
  continue to invest in R&D, we're going to continue to invest
  for innovation, unless the system changes dramatically, then
  we'll react to that.

Bobkoff: One of the refrains I hear is that
  investors have become increasingly short-term focused. Pharma,
  biotech are by their very nature a long-term play. It takes
  roughly 12 years to develop a drug from start to finish. So how
  do you as CEO balance those two things?

Saunders: Yeah, it's an excellent point. I think
  that one of the biggest changes in business since I started in
  this industry 20 years ago has been a change in view from
  shareholders around shorter-term performance. And I think the way
  I reconciled it is you really can't focus on one versus the
  other; you have to provide a little bit of something for
  everybody. So you need to have good short-term performance, you
  have to have sound mid-term strategy and performance, and
  ultimately, because of the product cycle and the way we innovate
  over the long term, really have conviction around your long-term
  strategy.


  And so I try to do it all. It sounds complicated, but it's quite
  simple: You need to execute against your business today and
  maximize all the opportunities that are available to you and your
  company, you need to invest appropriately for the midterm, and
  again really have a strong strategic vision where do you want to
  take your company long term so you can execute against that, and
  if you do that, you know frankly, then you don't worry about the
  activism.

Bobkoff: Have you made any decisions lately
  where you've had to make a tough call between something that
  might hurt the share price short term but you know might pay off
  in, say, 2018?

Saunders: Yeah, absolutely. We made a huge
  decision. We decided to divest our global generics business to
  Teva for $40.5 billion, a highly dilutive transaction. We really
  cut our earnings per share, in a time when everyone was doing
  accretive transactions, and I knew that that would create
  short-term pain for our shareholders, but I also realized that it
  was the right deal, incredibly sound strategic and industrial
  logic, and would allow Allergan mid and long term to flourish. So
  we did the deal, I led the deal, and we're close to closing it,
  and it should be a win-win. Teva should get a very strong
  strategic asset, and we'll become a very strong strategic branded
  innovative pharmaceutical company.


Why buybacks?

Bobkoff: Stock 
  buybacks are fascinating to me. They're very different than
  dividends, but those are often lumped in together. I believe you
  said that you are not a buyback CEO. Is that still what you
  believe?

Saunders: Yeah, it's a little unnatural for me.
  I think a lot of companies use buybacks to manage their earnings
  per share to essentially make the denominator smaller, to thereby
  grow earnings.


  We are a growth-oriented company; that's how we started the
  conversation. We tend to really focus on driving sales growth,
  which leads to earnings growth, but in this case, I think there
  are special circumstances where buybacks are appropriate, and in
  this instance where there's, in my belief, a fundamental
  disconnect between our share price and our performance, where we
  can take advantage of that and return some capital to our
  shareholders.


  Now, we get roughly $40 billion (from the Teva deal). We're
  spending 10 of it on share repurchases. I would not have been
  comfortable spending all 40, as a way of example. So I think we
  did it in a balanced and smart and prudent way, but it's not a
  natural move for me to make.

Bobkoff: Why not put that $10 billion into
  R&D, into paying more staff or hiring more people?

Saunders: Well, we will. We're going to take
  about $20 billion of, or half of the proceeds and invest for
  growth. It's not easy finding quality investments to deploy
  capital against. We happen to be quite good at it, I believe.
  We'll do it very carefully and thoughtfully, but we have plenty
  of firepower to invest for innovation and growth.

Bobkoff: Now, the criticism I hear of buybacks
  in general is that, as you said, they are, in some sense, a sort
  of financial engineering. A company is measured on earnings per
  share [EPS], and if you can make the number of S go down, then
  EPS goes up. And when you actually think about that at a very
  basic level, it just seems like, how is that a thing? How is that
  something investors put up with?

Saunders: Yeah, I think that's right. I don't
  think it should be a matter-of-fact move that just becomes part
  of the normal capital deployment of the company. I think it has
  to be a special situation or a special event where you deploy a
  share buyback, and that's what we're doing here at Allergan, and
  that's what got me comfortable with doing something that frankly
  was a little uncomfortable for me. But I think deploying it as
  just a de facto way of returning capital to shareholders I do
  think can damage long-term strategy.


How to price a drug

Bobkoff: There are many companies that say: We
  have to price drugs a certain amount to recoup R&D and
  regulatory expenses, and then they pay more than that to do a
  buyback. So is that a little disingenuous, do you think?

Saunders: Well, I don't know if it's
  disingenuous. You have to look at each situation and understand
  exactly what's happening and why, but look, I do think that drug
  discovery and drug development is an incredibly risky endeavor,
  and I think what gets lost sometimes is that we look at the cost
  of developing a particular drug and try to then understand how it
  was priced rather than looking at all the drug development and
  trying to figure out if the company itself get a return for
  its investment. Remember, as awful as it sounds to say, the
  winners pay for the losers in drug development, and there are
  more losers than winners. And we want to, as a society, I think,
  encourage companies to look for true opportunities to help people
  live their lives better, whether that be a treatment or a cure,
  and I think, to be fair we should be incentivizing our industry
  to do more to find cures and not just treatments, and really have
  a profound impact on people's lives.

Bobkoff: If you have a drug that went all the
  way through the process, went through regulatory, it's approved,
  how then do you decide what to charge?

Saunders: Well, you tend to look at a variety of
  different factors, and to be fair, we don't just pick a price to
  set a drug; we look at the impact it has on patients and the
  value of that impact to society. We then go out and talk to
  customers, namely managed-care and pharmacy benefit managers, and
  try to understand what they believe that value equation is and
  how much would they be willing to spend on a drug for their
  members, and we survey doctors and patient groups as well. And
  when you look at all those inputs you then decide how to price a
  drug where you feel like you can earn a return for the investment
  you've made in R&D but also honor the societal contract we
  have, which is to price our drugs in-line with the value they
  provide to society. ....


  Ultimately at the end of the day we as a society should be
  figuring out ways to incentivize industry to come up with more
  cures for unmet need and really help patients.

Bobkoff: Do we have those incentives?

Saunders: Well, I think they are questionable. I
  think a lot of the incentives in the industry today are, through
  no fault of anyone, they are the way the system was designed, is
  to really incentivize (treating) chronic treatment. And so, I
  think we're going to have to wrestle with this issue as the
  science has really started to advance and we can start talking
  about cures.


  We're at the cusp of a lot of gene therapy, moving into cures or
  potential cures. How do we price those things? And if we do it
  wrong, we will disincentivize future scientists and investors
  from supporting early high-risk research to get the next one. And
  so we have to be very sensitive to that.

Bobkoff: On average, how much would you say your
  drug prices go up each year?

Saunders: I would say ... mid to high single
  digits. That's the gross price, not the net price so, you know,
  it's very complicated.


  We tend to be very cautious about raising drug prices, but people
  should also remember that we continue to invest in the drugs
  after their approval. For example, we have a new drug for
  schizophrenia and bipolar mania that was just approved. We are
  now studying it for bipolar depression or major depressive
  disorder and negative symptoms, which is the holy grail of unmet
  need in the condition. Those studies are hundreds and hundreds of
  millions of dollars each, so if successful, we will need to raise
  the price of the drug to accommodate or pay for the cost of
  continuing to study it and invest in it.

Bobkoff: Now, I'm pretty sure it was 1992, Bill
  Clinton was just elected, and Merck made this decision that they
  were only going to increase their drug prices as much as the
  consumer price index. And then, I believe, most of the other
  major pharma companies followed suit a few years later. We have
  the prospect of another Clinton in the White House, and while
  there are a lot of reasons why Merck did that, one of them was, I
  presume, to avoid a crackdown on prices, and I wonder, what do
  you think about that strategy and whether it makes sense now?

Saunders: I understand why you would do it. To
  be fair, not all drugs are created equal. Some of these great
  immuno-oncology drugs that were just approved that are really
  changing the way cancer is treated — Jimmy Carter for example is
  alive in large part because of these developments. When they were
  launched, they were launched for very narrow indications because
  they were studied very narrowly. Should we not want them to
  continue investing to study those drugs in different cancers and
  in different combinations and therapies against different
  cancers? That's an incredibly expensive thing to do, so my fear
  would be we would agree to not increase price and therefore
  potentially chill the study of these drugs after they were
  priced. And that could be a mistake. So I think we need to be
  always mindful of how we price drugs and make sure that we make
  them available for all patients with means or without, with
  insurance or without, but I think just taking a blanket approach
  like they did in the old days could stifle innovation and
  therefore potentially be dangerous.

Bobkoff: When the news about Martin 
  Shkreli and Turing came out, what was your first reaction?

Saunders: I didn't have much of a reaction,
  other than, you know, it was an egregious behavior, and for me I
  think if there's a silver lining of this whole debacle, it's that
  the PBNs and the insurance industry have closed perhaps a
  loophole where some of these smaller drugs could be priced
  without review. And I think today it's almost impossible for that
  to repeat itself, not because of legislation or regulation but
  because the private market was so embarrassed by it, and
  rightfully so, basically clamped down on the ability for anybody
  to do that type of thing.


Inversion

Bobkoff: I want to talk about 
  inversions. For people who hear all the rhetoric about this,
  for the company, what are the advantages of being an Irish
  company for tax purposes?

Saunders: I think the perverse nature of
  one of the issues with inversions is we can more freely invest in
  the United States as a foreign company than we can as a US
  company. And what most people don't realize when they hear the
  sound bites that we're "avoiding paying taxes" is it's true:
  We're avoiding one particular tax, which no one pays, and that is
  repatriation and foreign earnings into the United States. That's
  the tax that's being avoided. However, no one repatriates cash
  into the United States, so that's why there's almost $3 trillion
  in US company cash sitting offshore. Why would you repatriate
  your cash at a 35% tax rate when you can borrow against it at 2
  to 3%? And so that's what's happening, whether it be Apple or it
  be Pfizer or the like — that's the way the system moves because
  capital will always move efficiently. And so the tax that's being
  avoided has not been paid and never will be paid.


  That being said, as a foreign-domiciled company, we can use the
  profits we generate outside the US to invest in the US without
  borrowing, which gives us much greater freedom and flexibility to
  invest wherever we see fit, and the United States happens to be
  one of the best places to invest that capital, so my sense is
  that if we ever as a country could solve that issue and do true
  corporate tax reform, that $3 trillion would far and away come
  screaming back to invest in the United States, and that would be
  a great thing for the economy.

Bobkoff: You actually had a little spat with
  your father about this?

Saunders: Well, it wasn't a spat. He was arguing
  that, much like the administration says, inversions could be
  unpatriotic or, I think the president called us unpatriotic
  capitalists, and I was arguing that taxes aren't a question of
  patriotism, that even the most American companies have tax
  departments that do everything they possibly can to minimize
  their tax burden, that most individuals will look and try to
  lower their tax burden to the lowest amount legally possible. And
  it's basically, you pay what you're legally required to pay: no
  more, no less.


  If you're patriotic, why weren't people just doubling their taxes
  and sending them in? You can pay more. The IRS would be happy to
  have more than you owe. But he kept insisting, and ultimately I
  said he had moved to Florida because it had zero state income tax
  and zero estate tax, and I said, look, you did a personal
  inversion, essentially left the Northeast for Florida as people
  have left California for Texas or Nevada to lower their tax
  burden, and the unfortunate part of all this is that people will
  always move to minimize their tax burden.


  However, the more resourced, wealthier an individual or company
  can do it better, because some people can't afford to move, and
  some companies can't accomplish an inversion. And so it really is
  a system that's screaming for reform, and I think corporate tax
  reform would be a huge boom to the US economy.

Bobkoff: For a company like yours, what does it
  actually mean to be based in Ireland? Do you visit often? Is
  there a big office there?

Saunders: Yeah, we do. We actually have a
  meaningful presence there. We have a few thousand employees in
  Ireland. We make many of our drugs in Ireland, I visit Ireland
  quite regularly, we hold every board of directors meeting in
  Ireland, we make all of our strategic decision in Ireland, so
  it's not just a P.O. Box or a mailbox but a meaningful presence
  for Allergan in Ireland.


A moral obligation?

Bobkoff: Do you think that pharma companies
  and biotech companies are different than those in other
  industries? Is there a moral obligation that's not there for
  companies that make, say, cellphones?

Saunders: I do think that there is. When you
  really look at the essence of our mission, it's to create a
  return for shareholders and to improve patients' lives, and both
  of those are important, but what other industry can you work in
  where you come to work every day trying to solve really big,
  important questions that have such a profound and meaningful
  impact on the people you're solving them for?

Bobkoff: What attracted you to healthcare?
  Because you don't have a background in it.

Saunders: No, my first job while I was working
  through law school and in business school was in a hospital in
  Philadelphia, and the point I was just making about this
  correlation between being able to do interesting work and make a
  good living and, you know, in a leadership position return
  capital to shareholders or return to shareholders and doing
  really good things in the world, I thought was just compelling.
  And that's what attracted me to healthcare and kept me in
  healthcare.

Bobkoff: Our series, The Price of
  Profits, chronicles a 40-plus-year shift. Decades ago, IBM
  and Merck executives would talk about taking care of their
  communities and the workers. Then there was this shift where the
  only stakeholders who mattered were shareholders. It was
  especially true in the 1980s and '90s. And I wonder, what do you
  think about that, and do you think things are changing?

Saunders: Frankly, things are changing. I think
  they change for the better, which is you can't worry about
  patients and the communities and employees unless you've done
  well by shareholders. And so, you know, doing well by
  shareholders is kind of a ticket to play the game, to do all the
  other great things you want to do. And so that has caused us to
  operate our businesses sharper, to make sure that we're staying
  on our toes and being competitive and understanding the
  environment and making sure we make great decisions, but it also
  then allows us to do the other things with greater confidence, so
  you know, I think there is no nirvana, there is no perfect
  situation, but overall we sit in a very enviable position in the
  business community to be able to do the things we do and still do
  great things.

Bobkoff: I would argue, actually, that the CEOs
  of the '50s and '60s would have had it the other way around. They
  would say that by taking care of your employees and treating them
  well and making great products, having great customer service,
  the profits come from that. Do you agree?

Saunders: Well I think in part it does — they're
  all connected in some way — but I do think we live in a different
  time where information flows so readily and so rapidly and all
  decisions are evaluated and second- and triple-guessed and the
  like, and so shareholders then react differently, and there's
  money in hedge funds and shorter-term funds, and that's just the
  reality, so you have to manage your business given the reality
  that exists today, and it's not good or bad, it just is what it
  is, and I think it's completely manageable. You just have to have
  the right mindset and attitude to get through it.


Deals and surprises

Bobkoff: It's a tough deal environment right
  now. Obviously the Pfizer deal fell through. What is your focus
  going forward? Are you going to do smaller deals and maybe skip
  some of the cross-border ones?

Saunders: We're not focused on transformational
  M&A; we're focused on investing for growth to really support
  our current business, and that's both R&D and intellectual
  property assets as well as growth concerns. The one caveat is
  that whatever it is we buy has to support our agenda for growth
  and therapeutic area leadership, and if they satisfy that
  strategically, then it's interesting.

Bobkoff: On a personal level, what was the
  biggest surprise in your business career?

Saunders: The fact that we [Actavis] could
  actually buy Allergan. I mean, the old Allergan was such a
  well-run company with some best-in-class programs, great R&D
  capabilities, and great people and expertise. The fact that that
  would become available because of a hostile attack [from Valeant]
  and we could step in as a white knight – I pinch myself, and
  saying I can't believe that actually happened to such a great
  company, but we are where we are, and I think we've made it
  stronger and we're very excited about our future.

Mike Nudelman / Business
  Insider



You could say it comes with the territory: As CEO of
  Allergan, Brent Saunders once received Botox injections onstage.
  But at just 46, he already has fewer wrinkles than most leaders
  of pharmaceutical companies. His fast rise has been driven by
  dealmaking, and it was a deal by his previous company Actavis to
  buy Allergan, the maker of Botox and other drugs, that many say
  saved the company from falling into the hands of the troubled
  pharmaceutical firm Valeant. For our series, The Price of
  Profits, we 
  sat down with Saunders at the Business Insider office.


This interview has been edited for length and
  clarity.

Dan Bobkoff: Allergan has grown a lot in the
  last few years through a number of mergers and acquisitions.
  You're not calling Allergan "Big Pharma." You have a different
  term for it?

Brent Saunders: We like to think of ourselves as
  "Growth Pharma," and we've defined "Growth Pharma" as companies
  that invest in innovation but also have a strong top-line sales
  growth profile. And the reason that's important is that
  innovation is the lifeblood of our industry, and I think to
  really have sustained leadership in any therapeutic area you have
  to continue to innovate. That's what we do; that's the core of
  our business. Growth, on the other hand, goes to culture, and
  while many in our industry are focused on cost-cutting and
  downsizing, we want to be a growth-oriented company where we look
  to really drive leadership therapeutically, leadership globally,
  and invest in our brands, whether that be in science or sales and
  marketing.

Bobkoff: If you were to compare your company to,
  say, Merck — a big, old-line company — how are you different?

Saunders: I think that we're alike in many
  regards in that we have a deep respect for innovation and the
  role of R&D. I think we differ in how we approach it. And we
  tend to be a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more
  scrappy. We tend to be a little bit more action-oriented, not
  operating with lots of committees or bureaucracy but more
  individual accountability with a bias to action.

Bobkoff: And you do more acquisition than
  in-house development.

Saunders: Well, I don't think that's really the
  best way to think about it. We acquire intellectual property, or
  R&D assets, and then develop them in-house. We have about
  2,000 people in R&D, we spend about a billion and a half
  dollars a year on R&D. What we don't have are discovery labs.
  What I would tell you is the vast majority of the late-stage
  pipeline of Big Pharma, as we call it, comes from external
  innovation; they are sourcing most of those innovations from
  academia, from startups, from venture-backed companies and the
  like. We do the same thing; we just do it with the absence of
  being held to the capital structure of discovery laboratories.
  But nonetheless, innovation is the lifeblood of what we do.

Bobkoff: Typically, at what point do you acquire
  the intellectual property? How far along is it in the
  development?

Saunders: We tend to look at it across the
  entire continuum. We tend to try to structure for risk, so if
  it's earlier-stage development, let's say, preclinical, we may do
  it in a partnership with a discovery-based company. If it's got
  proof of concept or early clinical results, let's say, from human
  testing, we may structure it as an option agreement, and allow
  the smaller, more focused company to bring it to a later stage of
  development. Phase 2 or 3, where we really have strong conviction
  around the science and the program, we will buy it outright and
  finish it ourselves.


The anti-Valeant

Bobkoff: Before you arrived, Valeant wanted to
  acquire Allergan. And they famously said that they wanted to
  slash all R&D. Is it fair to say that the merger you were
  part of was in response to that?

Saunders: It was. We (at Actavis) were what was
  called by many a white knight. We were a friendly solution for
  the old Allergan management team in large part I guess because of
  the hostile attack from Valeant and Pershing Square's Bill
  Ackman. And so when we stepped in, we looked at how we could
  actually support and grow the company, and a good example is old
  Allergan spent about $900 million in R&D, and we spent about
  a billion and a half ... so we've actually increased R&D
  expenditure. 


Stakeholders versus shareholders

Bobkoff: When you make decisions, what are your
  priorities? How do you decide which stakeholders to take into
  account and where to prioritize them?

Saunders: I really think about two or three
  constituents as the most important. And I think they all kind of
  work in harmony. One, we have our shareholders, and they have
  invested their capital in our company and we have to provide a
  return for them and hopefully above market, above industry
  average returns. We have patients, where we invest to improve
  their lives either through treatments for their disease or cure
  for their illness, and then we have our employees and communities
  that benefit when we do well by the other two constituents.

Bobkoff: So would you call yourself a more of a
  stakeholder-view person, versus the sort of shareholder-focused
  view?

Saunders: Well, I think they're actually very
  consistent. When we do well for patients, when we come up with
  innovation for an unmet need, when we can improve a patient's
  life by one of our treatments, our shareholders benefit. So I
  don't really view any disconnect between the two. If we do right
  by one, the other will do well.

Bobkoff: In 1952, George Merck — then the head
  of Merck & Co. — had this famous statement: "Medicine is for
  the patient, not for the profits. The profits follow." Do you
  also abide by that?

Saunders: I think that's fair. I think I would
  caveat that, though, and I'd say that doesn't mean you can spend
  money recklessly, right? and I think it's —

Bobkoff: What's recklessly?

Saunders: Well, I think that you have to make
  sure that you're investing the corporate resources in a
  significant way to support that goal for patients. You can get
  distracted and build a big skyscraper-type headquarters. A
  company I came from, Bausch & Lomb, did that in Rochester,
  and so I think that you have to always make sure that you think
  about the patient and the shareholder in the same context and if
  you do that, and you stay tight and focused, then they live in
  harmony, but they could easily diverge under the name of "we're
  doing right by patients."

Bobkoff: I get the sense that there's almost
  nostalgia from some people for the days of the big old companies
  with massive research labs that would discover drugs, and then
  one organization would bring it all the way to market through the
  FDA. Are those days over?

Saunders: I do think they're over, but I think
  that's, frankly, a good thing given the time we're in. The
  science of human health has exploded, in part because of the
  human genome, in part because of biology and chemistry and how
  they play together, and it is too expensive and too complicated
  for any one company to corner all the great ideas that lead to
  drug discovery.


  And so the ecosystem, if you will, of inventors, of scientists,
  of academia, and the like, is far larger than one company could
  ever recreate. We'd rather support that ecosystem, and encourage
  that ecosystem to take on the higher-risk, early, tough science
  and let us step in where we can really bring expertise as a
  pharmaceutical company. And that can be in clinical development,
  that could be in pharmaceutical science, that could be in
  regulatory affairs, and certainly commercial capabilities, and
  really have a specialization of best interest, to really make
  sure that those investments pay off so that more people want to
  go into science and invest in taking on those high-risk projects.

Botox

Bobkoff: Now, before the mergers, there was this
  idea that Botox is your pipeline in a vial. There are so many
  uses, and more in development. Is that still the case?

Saunders: Well, yeah, I do think Botox is still
  a pipeline in a product, is what I like to call it, and if you
  think about it, Botox has been around for about 10 years — we
  have 11 approved indications. We sell more Botox for therapeutic
  indications like migraine or spasticity or OAB [overactive
  bladder] than we do for wrinkles, and we're studying it for many
  other potential therapeutic benefits ... potentially depression,
  
  AFIB, and a whole host of other ones. And so we're probably
  not even halfway through understanding the role that Botox can
  play in therapeutic health as well as aesthetic medicine.

Bobkoff: How do you prepare for the day when at
  some point you will run out of uses for it?

Saunders: I'm not worried about it until we
  probably get to somewhere closer to 2030, so we have plenty of
  time and I don't spend a ton of time worrying about that risk.
  Many other risks, but not that one.


Icahn's influence?

Bobkoff: I was a little bit surprised to hear
  that you view your role as more of a stakeholder CEO. You have
  the shareholders, you have the workers, you have the community.
  Now you have Carl Icahn as a big investor, and if you look at
  what happened with 
  Apple, he really pushed buybacks and then got out pretty
  quickly. So how can you maintain that strategy, that view, when
  you have any kind of activist investor on board like that?

Saunders: Yeah, look, I view Carl as just one of
  many important shareholders at Allergan. We listen to all of our
  shareholders, activist and passive and long-term and short-term
  shareholders, because again we don't have a monopoly on all the
  best thinking. It's always good to hear different points of view.
  I think Carl's intention here is constructive. He is an investor.
  He is not looking to be an activist at Allergan, and so I welcome
  him and obviously he saw something I also saw, which is that our
  stock was undervalued, and that's why we have committed to a $10
  billion share buyback at the close of our Teva transaction,
  because our stock is an overwhelmingly great investment, in my
  humble opinion, and Carl, I guess, agrees.

  Business Network show in New York.

Bobkoff: What is your relationship with Icahn?

Saunders: Well, you know, I met Carl by being in
  a slate of directors at first that were in opposition to his
  slate. We met in a bit of a professional conflict, but ultimately
  I became CEO of that company. I worked very closely with him. I
  think he was very constructive in advocating for succession
  planning and a few issues at Forest Labs, and I think it worked
  out well for all stakeholders.


  Shareholders certainly did well — we were able to fund our
  pipeline. In fact today we got one of the drugs approved from
  back in those days, so I think patients ultimately won, and
  employees are in a much stronger, more vibrant company today than
  they've ever been. So I welcome Carl, and I think he'll be a good
  long-term investor.

Bobkoff: Icahn's being friendly now, things are
  good, the stock is supposedly undervalued, but if anything goes
  wrong, can't you imagine a day when he becomes an activist? Isn't
  that who he is?

Saunders: Well, I think that's always something
  you worry about, and certainly at the flip of a switch he could
  change his mind and become an activist — and so could many other
  shareholders. Or he could just enter or any other activist could
  enter the stock if something went wrong, so I don't spend a lot
  of time worrying about that. Rather I stay focused on executing
  our strategy and making sure we operate our business to the best
  of our ability and from there, you know, good things generally do
  happen.

Bobkoff: So if in six months or a year Carl
  Icahn or somebody else comes to you and says, you know what,
  you're spending too much on R&D, give more to shareholders,
  do a huge buyback, will you say no?

Saunders: Well, I'd have to understand the
  facts. The one thing I'll say is that I would listen to them, and
  I'll listen to any shareholder, not just Carl, but it's unlikely
  that we would do that, given where we sit today. But if the
  circumstances were different, I'd want to understand why they
  think that, and I'd be open-minded about it, but we're going to
  continue to invest in R&D, we're going to continue to invest
  for innovation, unless the system changes dramatically, then
  we'll react to that.

Bobkoff: One of the refrains I hear is that
  investors have become increasingly short-term focused. Pharma,
  biotech are by their very nature a long-term play. It takes
  roughly 12 years to develop a drug from start to finish. So how
  do you as CEO balance those two things?

Saunders: Yeah, it's an excellent point. I think
  that one of the biggest changes in business since I started in
  this industry 20 years ago has been a change in view from
  shareholders around shorter-term performance. And I think the way
  I reconciled it is you really can't focus on one versus the
  other; you have to provide a little bit of something for
  everybody. So you need to have good short-term performance, you
  have to have sound mid-term strategy and performance, and
  ultimately, because of the product cycle and the way we innovate
  over the long term, really have conviction around your long-term
  strategy.


  And so I try to do it all. It sounds complicated, but it's quite
  simple: You need to execute against your business today and
  maximize all the opportunities that are available to you and your
  company, you need to invest appropriately for the midterm, and
  again really have a strong strategic vision where do you want to
  take your company long term so you can execute against that, and
  if you do that, you know frankly, then you don't worry about the
  activism.

Bobkoff: Have you made any decisions lately
  where you've had to make a tough call between something that
  might hurt the share price short term but you know might pay off
  in, say, 2018?

Saunders: Yeah, absolutely. We made a huge
  decision. We decided to divest our global generics business to
  Teva for $40.5 billion, a highly dilutive transaction. We really
  cut our earnings per share, in a time when everyone was doing
  accretive transactions, and I knew that that would create
  short-term pain for our shareholders, but I also realized that it
  was the right deal, incredibly sound strategic and industrial
  logic, and would allow Allergan mid and long term to flourish. So
  we did the deal, I led the deal, and we're close to closing it,
  and it should be a win-win. Teva should get a very strong
  strategic asset, and we'll become a very strong strategic branded
  innovative pharmaceutical company.


Why buybacks?

Bobkoff: Stock 
  buybacks are fascinating to me. They're very different than
  dividends, but those are often lumped in together. I believe you
  said that you are not a buyback CEO. Is that still what you
  believe?

Saunders: Yeah, it's a little unnatural for me.
  I think a lot of companies use buybacks to manage their earnings
  per share to essentially make the denominator smaller, to thereby
  grow earnings.


  We are a growth-oriented company; that's how we started the
  conversation. We tend to really focus on driving sales growth,
  which leads to earnings growth, but in this case, I think there
  are special circumstances where buybacks are appropriate, and in
  this instance where there's, in my belief, a fundamental
  disconnect between our share price and our performance, where we
  can take advantage of that and return some capital to our
  shareholders.


  Now, we get roughly $40 billion (from the Teva deal). We're
  spending 10 of it on share repurchases. I would not have been
  comfortable spending all 40, as a way of example. So I think we
  did it in a balanced and smart and prudent way, but it's not a
  natural move for me to make.

Bobkoff: Why not put that $10 billion into
  R&D, into paying more staff or hiring more people?

Saunders: Well, we will. We're going to take
  about $20 billion of, or half of the proceeds and invest for
  growth. It's not easy finding quality investments to deploy
  capital against. We happen to be quite good at it, I believe.
  We'll do it very carefully and thoughtfully, but we have plenty
  of firepower to invest for innovation and growth.

Bobkoff: Now, the criticism I hear of buybacks
  in general is that, as you said, they are, in some sense, a sort
  of financial engineering. A company is measured on earnings per
  share [EPS], and if you can make the number of S go down, then
  EPS goes up. And when you actually think about that at a very
  basic level, it just seems like, how is that a thing? How is that
  something investors put up with?

Saunders: Yeah, I think that's right. I don't
  think it should be a matter-of-fact move that just becomes part
  of the normal capital deployment of the company. I think it has
  to be a special situation or a special event where you deploy a
  share buyback, and that's what we're doing here at Allergan, and
  that's what got me comfortable with doing something that frankly
  was a little uncomfortable for me. But I think deploying it as
  just a de facto way of returning capital to shareholders I do
  think can damage long-term strategy.


How to price a drug

Bobkoff: There are many companies that say: We
  have to price drugs a certain amount to recoup R&D and
  regulatory expenses, and then they pay more than that to do a
  buyback. So is that a little disingenuous, do you think?

Saunders: Well, I don't know if it's
  disingenuous. You have to look at each situation and understand
  exactly what's happening and why, but look, I do think that drug
  discovery and drug development is an incredibly risky endeavor,
  and I think what gets lost sometimes is that we look at the cost
  of developing a particular drug and try to then understand how it
  was priced rather than looking at all the drug development and
  trying to figure out if the company itself get a return for
  its investment. Remember, as awful as it sounds to say, the
  winners pay for the losers in drug development, and there are
  more losers than winners. And we want to, as a society, I think,
  encourage companies to look for true opportunities to help people
  live their lives better, whether that be a treatment or a cure,
  and I think, to be fair we should be incentivizing our industry
  to do more to find cures and not just treatments, and really have
  a profound impact on people's lives.

Bobkoff: If you have a drug that went all the
  way through the process, went through regulatory, it's approved,
  how then do you decide what to charge?

Saunders: Well, you tend to look at a variety of
  different factors, and to be fair, we don't just pick a price to
  set a drug; we look at the impact it has on patients and the
  value of that impact to society. We then go out and talk to
  customers, namely managed-care and pharmacy benefit managers, and
  try to understand what they believe that value equation is and
  how much would they be willing to spend on a drug for their
  members, and we survey doctors and patient groups as well. And
  when you look at all those inputs you then decide how to price a
  drug where you feel like you can earn a return for the investment
  you've made in R&D but also honor the societal contract we
  have, which is to price our drugs in-line with the value they
  provide to society. ....


  Ultimately at the end of the day we as a society should be
  figuring out ways to incentivize industry to come up with more
  cures for unmet need and really help patients.

Bobkoff: Do we have those incentives?

Saunders: Well, I think they are questionable. I
  think a lot of the incentives in the industry today are, through
  no fault of anyone, they are the way the system was designed, is
  to really incentivize (treating) chronic treatment. And so, I
  think we're going to have to wrestle with this issue as the
  science has really started to advance and we can start talking
  about cures.


  We're at the cusp of a lot of gene therapy, moving into cures or
  potential cures. How do we price those things? And if we do it
  wrong, we will disincentivize future scientists and investors
  from supporting early high-risk research to get the next one. And
  so we have to be very sensitive to that.

Bobkoff: On average, how much would you say your
  drug prices go up each year?

Saunders: I would say ... mid to high single
  digits. That's the gross price, not the net price so, you know,
  it's very complicated.


  We tend to be very cautious about raising drug prices, but people
  should also remember that we continue to invest in the drugs
  after their approval. For example, we have a new drug for
  schizophrenia and bipolar mania that was just approved. We are
  now studying it for bipolar depression or major depressive
  disorder and negative symptoms, which is the holy grail of unmet
  need in the condition. Those studies are hundreds and hundreds of
  millions of dollars each, so if successful, we will need to raise
  the price of the drug to accommodate or pay for the cost of
  continuing to study it and invest in it.

Bobkoff: Now, I'm pretty sure it was 1992, Bill
  Clinton was just elected, and Merck made this decision that they
  were only going to increase their drug prices as much as the
  consumer price index. And then, I believe, most of the other
  major pharma companies followed suit a few years later. We have
  the prospect of another Clinton in the White House, and while
  there are a lot of reasons why Merck did that, one of them was, I
  presume, to avoid a crackdown on prices, and I wonder, what do
  you think about that strategy and whether it makes sense now?

Saunders: I understand why you would do it. To
  be fair, not all drugs are created equal. Some of these great
  immuno-oncology drugs that were just approved that are really
  changing the way cancer is treated — Jimmy Carter for example is
  alive in large part because of these developments. When they were
  launched, they were launched for very narrow indications because
  they were studied very narrowly. Should we not want them to
  continue investing to study those drugs in different cancers and
  in different combinations and therapies against different
  cancers? That's an incredibly expensive thing to do, so my fear
  would be we would agree to not increase price and therefore
  potentially chill the study of these drugs after they were
  priced. And that could be a mistake. So I think we need to be
  always mindful of how we price drugs and make sure that we make
  them available for all patients with means or without, with
  insurance or without, but I think just taking a blanket approach
  like they did in the old days could stifle innovation and
  therefore potentially be dangerous.

  before a hearing in Washington.

Bobkoff: When the news about Martin 
  Shkreli and Turing came out, what was your first reaction?

Saunders: I didn't have much of a reaction,
  other than, you know, it was an egregious behavior, and for me I
  think if there's a silver lining of this whole debacle, it's that
  the PBNs and the insurance industry have closed perhaps a
  loophole where some of these smaller drugs could be priced
  without review. And I think today it's almost impossible for that
  to repeat itself, not because of legislation or regulation but
  because the private market was so embarrassed by it, and
  rightfully so, basically clamped down on the ability for anybody
  to do that type of thing.


Inversion

Bobkoff: I want to talk about 
  inversions. For people who hear all the rhetoric about this,
  for the company, what are the advantages of being an Irish
  company for tax purposes?

Saunders: I think the perverse nature of
  one of the issues with inversions is we can more freely invest in
  the United States as a foreign company than we can as a US
  company. And what most people don't realize when they hear the
  sound bites that we're "avoiding paying taxes" is it's true:
  We're avoiding one particular tax, which no one pays, and that is
  repatriation and foreign earnings into the United States. That's
  the tax that's being avoided. However, no one repatriates cash
  into the United States, so that's why there's almost $3 trillion
  in US company cash sitting offshore. Why would you repatriate
  your cash at a 35% tax rate when you can borrow against it at 2
  to 3%? And so that's what's happening, whether it be Apple or it
  be Pfizer or the like — that's the way the system moves because
  capital will always move efficiently. And so the tax that's being
  avoided has not been paid and never will be paid.


  That being said, as a foreign-domiciled company, we can use the
  profits we generate outside the US to invest in the US without
  borrowing, which gives us much greater freedom and flexibility to
  invest wherever we see fit, and the United States happens to be
  one of the best places to invest that capital, so my sense is
  that if we ever as a country could solve that issue and do true
  corporate tax reform, that $3 trillion would far and away come
  screaming back to invest in the United States, and that would be
  a great thing for the economy.

Bobkoff: You actually had a little spat with
  your father about this?

Saunders: Well, it wasn't a spat. He was arguing
  that, much like the administration says, inversions could be
  unpatriotic or, I think the president called us unpatriotic
  capitalists, and I was arguing that taxes aren't a question of
  patriotism, that even the most American companies have tax
  departments that do everything they possibly can to minimize
  their tax burden, that most individuals will look and try to
  lower their tax burden to the lowest amount legally possible. And
  it's basically, you pay what you're legally required to pay: no
  more, no less.


  If you're patriotic, why weren't people just doubling their taxes
  and sending them in? You can pay more. The IRS would be happy to
  have more than you owe. But he kept insisting, and ultimately I
  said he had moved to Florida because it had zero state income tax
  and zero estate tax, and I said, look, you did a personal
  inversion, essentially left the Northeast for Florida as people
  have left California for Texas or Nevada to lower their tax
  burden, and the unfortunate part of all this is that people will
  always move to minimize their tax burden.


  However, the more resourced, wealthier an individual or company
  can do it better, because some people can't afford to move, and
  some companies can't accomplish an inversion. And so it really is
  a system that's screaming for reform, and I think corporate tax
  reform would be a huge boom to the US economy.

Bobkoff: For a company like yours, what does it
  actually mean to be based in Ireland? Do you visit often? Is
  there a big office there?

Saunders: Yeah, we do. We actually have a
  meaningful presence there. We have a few thousand employees in
  Ireland. We make many of our drugs in Ireland, I visit Ireland
  quite regularly, we hold every board of directors meeting in
  Ireland, we make all of our strategic decision in Ireland, so
  it's not just a P.O. Box or a mailbox but a meaningful presence
  for Allergan in Ireland.


A moral obligation?

Bobkoff: Do you think that pharma companies
  and biotech companies are different than those in other
  industries? Is there a moral obligation that's not there for
  companies that make, say, cellphones?

Saunders: I do think that there is. When you
  really look at the essence of our mission, it's to create a
  return for shareholders and to improve patients' lives, and both
  of those are important, but what other industry can you work in
  where you come to work every day trying to solve really big,
  important questions that have such a profound and meaningful
  impact on the people you're solving them for?

Bobkoff: What attracted you to healthcare?
  Because you don't have a background in it.

Saunders: No, my first job while I was working
  through law school and in business school was in a hospital in
  Philadelphia, and the point I was just making about this
  correlation between being able to do interesting work and make a
  good living and, you know, in a leadership position return
  capital to shareholders or return to shareholders and doing
  really good things in the world, I thought was just compelling.
  And that's what attracted me to healthcare and kept me in
  healthcare.

Bobkoff: Our series, The Price of
  Profits, chronicles a 40-plus-year shift. Decades ago, IBM
  and Merck executives would talk about taking care of their
  communities and the workers. Then there was this shift where the
  only stakeholders who mattered were shareholders. It was
  especially true in the 1980s and '90s. And I wonder, what do you
  think about that, and do you think things are changing?

Saunders: Frankly, things are changing. I think
  they change for the better, which is you can't worry about
  patients and the communities and employees unless you've done
  well by shareholders. And so, you know, doing well by
  shareholders is kind of a ticket to play the game, to do all the
  other great things you want to do. And so that has caused us to
  operate our businesses sharper, to make sure that we're staying
  on our toes and being competitive and understanding the
  environment and making sure we make great decisions, but it also
  then allows us to do the other things with greater confidence, so
  you know, I think there is no nirvana, there is no perfect
  situation, but overall we sit in a very enviable position in the
  business community to be able to do the things we do and still do
  great things.

Bobkoff: I would argue, actually, that the CEOs
  of the '50s and '60s would have had it the other way around. They
  would say that by taking care of your employees and treating them
  well and making great products, having great customer service,
  the profits come from that. Do you agree?

Saunders: Well I think in part it does — they're
  all connected in some way — but I do think we live in a different
  time where information flows so readily and so rapidly and all
  decisions are evaluated and second- and triple-guessed and the
  like, and so shareholders then react differently, and there's
  money in hedge funds and shorter-term funds, and that's just the
  reality, so you have to manage your business given the reality
  that exists today, and it's not good or bad, it just is what it
  is, and I think it's completely manageable. You just have to have
  the right mindset and attitude to get through it.


Deals and surprises

Bobkoff: It's a tough deal environment right
  now. Obviously the Pfizer deal fell through. What is your focus
  going forward? Are you going to do smaller deals and maybe skip
  some of the cross-border ones?

Saunders: We're not focused on transformational
  M&A; we're focused on investing for growth to really support
  our current business, and that's both R&D and intellectual
  property assets as well as growth concerns. The one caveat is
  that whatever it is we buy has to support our agenda for growth
  and therapeutic area leadership, and if they satisfy that
  strategically, then it's interesting.

Bobkoff: On a personal level, what was the
  biggest surprise in your business career?

Saunders: The fact that we [Actavis] could
  actually buy Allergan. I mean, the old Allergan was such a
  well-run company with some best-in-class programs, great R&D
  capabilities, and great people and expertise. The fact that that
  would become available because of a hostile attack [from Valeant]
  and we could step in as a white knight – I pinch myself, and
  saying I can't believe that actually happened to such a great
  company, but we are where we are, and I think we've made it
  stronger and we're very excited about our future.
