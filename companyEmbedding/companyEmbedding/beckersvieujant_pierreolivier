Pierre-Olivier Beckers, Didier Smits to Leave Delhaize Board
Terms expire at the end of May

March 6, 2015, 02:36 pm



 



Baron Pierre-Olivier Beckers-Vieujant and Didier Smits will not seek re-election as Delhaize Group board directors when their current terms expire in late May.
A director since 1995, Beckers was the retail conglomerate’s president and CEO from 1999 until 2013. Under Beckers’ leadership, Delhaize Group grew its international presence and evolved into an integrated group and leading food retailer, as evidenced by its recent quarterly financials reporting strong fourth-quarter comparable-store sales at its Food Lion and Hannaford banners in the U.S.
"He has shown tremendous leadership in running the business during challenging times and has always displayed very strong values and great respect for people," said Mats Jansson, the board's chairman. "A number of significant initiatives started under his leadership are beginning to bear fruit today and position us well for sustainable growth."
Of Smits, managing director of Papeteries Aubry SPRL since 1991 and a member of Delhaize's board since 1996, Jansson noted: "I have appreciated his loyalty, his thoughtful comments, and his integrity. His contribution to the board was valued and will be missed."
Brussels-based Delhaize is an international food retailer present in seven countries on three continents. It currently operates 3,402 stores and employs about 150,000 people.
