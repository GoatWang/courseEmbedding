Gregory P. Ho






President and COO, Spring Mountain Capital, LP
Greg is a founding partner of Spring Mountain Capital, which was established in 2001 and focuses on alternative asset investing, including hedge funds, private equity, and special situations. SMC’s preference is to invest “away from the crowd” and “in the gaps,” which means it seeks opportunities which many investors avoid because of their complexity, illiquidity, uncertainty, mis-staging, or other disfavored factor. Greg was born in Hawaii, left the islands for Yale in 1970, and received a B.S. in Administrative Science in 1974. He received a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1977, was admitted to the New York and California bars, and practiced tax law at a major NYC law firm. He joined McKinsey & Company, Inc. in 1982, was elected a Principal in 1987, and became Chief Financial Officer in 1992. During his 16 years at McKinsey, Greg redesigned and internationalized its global partner sharing structure, co-founded the McKinsey Investment Office, and participated in the opening of new offices in over 30 countries.
Greg is a member of the Advisory Board of Columbia Law School’s Center for Public Research and Leadership; the Investor Board of Venture for America; the Advisory Board of SheWorx, a global collective of female entrepreneurs; and the Board of Trustees for the Museum of Chinese in America. He also serves on the Board of Directors of IsoPlexis Corporation, a YEI startup in which SMC was the lead investor; is an Advisor to Lemma, Inc., an EdTech company whose mission is to reconceptualize what is possible in online education and deliver self-contained STEM courses through a uniquely interactive and responsive platform; and is an investor in, and advisor to, three popular bar/restaurants in Paris. Greg started running marathons for various charitable causes in 2008, and expects to complete his 21st marathon later this year as member of the Fisher House team.
Greg and his wife Linda Sanchez live in the Upper West Side of Manhattan and have one daughter who attends Boston College.

President and COO, Spring Mountain Capital, LP
Greg is a founding partner of Spring Mountain Capital, which was established in 2001 and focuses on alternative asset investing, including hedge funds, private equity, and special situations. SMC’s preference is to invest “away from the crowd” and “in the gaps,” which means it seeks opportunities which many investors avoid because of their complexity, illiquidity, uncertainty, mis-staging, or other disfavored factor. Greg was born in Hawaii, left the islands for Yale in 1970, and received a B.S. in Administrative Science in 1974.
