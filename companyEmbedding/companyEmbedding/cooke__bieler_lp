Toggle Menu







One Team
One Philosophy
One Process






                Through a disciplined, bottom-up process refined over Cooke & Bieler’s long history, our investment team uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to identify attractive opportunities. Individual decision making and small group dynamics are central features.
            









Identify




                            Step One
                        

                            Analysts identify potential investments through ongoing research within an industry/sector, industry-specific screens, and our internal database of normalized earnings. They also do so through conversations with company management, attending conferences, reading industry publications, and sharing research across the team. Research responsibilities are organized by industry/sector coverage.
                        










Analyze




                            Step Two
                        

                            The analyst verifies and analyzes quantifiable factors (financial history, industry dynamics) and evaluates subjective factors (management strategy, industry structure, management stewardship). Management visits are performed, as are discussions with key competitors and constituents throughout the supply chain. The analysis of these factors provides inputs for Cooke & Bieler’s proprietary financial model.
                        










Decide




                            Step Three
                        

                            The analyst presents new ideas to the investment team and, following an active dialogue with the team, will decide whether to initiate a position. The decision process is not consensus-driven, and the judgment of the analyst is key.
                        










Collaborate




                            Step Four
                        

                            Our team discusses how new ideas fit into the portfolio, as well as any top-down considerations and macro-related risks.
                        










Monitor




                            Step Five
                        

                            Cooke & Bieler analysts continually monitor portfolio holdings by meeting with management and reviewing new developments. Analysts produce quarterly accountability statements on their positions, and the investment team meets on a weekly basis to formally monitor the portfolio and review specific positions.

What are analysts saying about Illinois Tool Works stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Illinois Tool Works stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "In the last three months, Illinois Tool's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery-General Industrial market. Over the long run, the company’s organic and inorganic growth tactics, its long-term Enterprise Strategy and sound capital allocation schemes will prove beneficial. For 2017, it increased its earnings guidance to $6.20-$6.40 per share. Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2-4%, an improvement over the prior forecast of 1.5-3.5%. Total revenue is anticipated to come within $13.9-$14.1 billion range. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates on the stock increased for 2018. " (7/12/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "ITW hosted an Investor Day in New York this morning and provided initial guidance for 2017. Organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% and 100bps of EBIT expansion from Enterprise Initiatives are projected to yield EPS in the range of $6.00-$6.20 (Consensus at $6.14 on revenue growth of 3%). With a strong history of execution and low drama, we continue to view ITW as a core holding. Bottom Line: 2017 another year of stable growth. ITW’s preliminary forecast for organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% for 2017 compares to current consensus forecast of ~3% but assumes no improvement in end market trends. The guidance includes roughly 50bps of headwind from Product Line Simplification (PLS) actions, lower than the 100bps headwind since 2014-16. ITW’s targeted EPS range of $6.00-$6.20 compares to current consensus of $6.14. Of note: ITW’s 2017 EBIT margin target is 23.5%, 100bps above the 2016 target, and indeed management noted the target could be conservative." (12/5/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Unilever NV (NYSE:UN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.71)Consensus Price Target: N/A
