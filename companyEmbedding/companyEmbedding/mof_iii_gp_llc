	with the result that no person will continue to rely on the Prior Order if the Order is granted.


	 


	The relief requested in
	this application for an Order (the “


	Application


	”) would allow a Regulated Entity and one or
	more other Regulated Entities and/or one or more Affiliated Funds to participate in the same investment opportunities through
	a proposed co-investment program where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) and
	Rule 17d-1 (the “


	Co-Investment Program


	”).

	8



	 


	A Regulated Entity may, from time
	to time, form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subs. Such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a
	Co-Investment Transaction with any Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Entity because it would be a company controlled by
	the Regulated Entity for purposes of Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) and Rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned
	Investment Sub be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of the Regulated Entity that owns it and
	that the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the Regulated Entity were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified
	because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated
	Entity’s investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Entity and the
	Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Entity’s Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions
	with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated
	Entity’s Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in
	the Regulated Entity’s place. If the Regulated Entity proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction
	with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board of the Regulated Entity will also be informed of, and take into
	consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.

	I. 

	APPLICANTS




	 







	A.




	Medley Capital Corporation





	 


	MCC is an externally managed, closed-end,
	non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC. MCC filed a registration statement
	on Form N-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “


	1933 Act


	”) in connection with its initial
	public offering, which became effective on January 20, 2011. In addition, MCC has elected to be treated as a regulated investment
	company (“


	RIC


	”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “


	Code


	”)
	and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC in the future. MCC’s principal place of business is 280 Park Avenue, 6

	th

	Floor East, New York, New York 10017.


	 


	MCC’s investment objective is to
	generate current income and capital appreciation by lending directly to privately-held middle market companies. MCC’s investments
	are made directly through MCC, and may in the future be made through one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subs that MCC may establish
	from time to time. Such Wholly-Owned Investment Subs will have Objectives and Strategies (as defined below) that are substantially
	the same as, or a subset of, those of MCC, although the Wholly-Owned Investment Subs will be subject to different regulatory regimes.
	MCC’s portfolio will generally consist of secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, subordinate loans and equity positions
	in situations where they are also a secured lender. MCC seeks to provide customized financing solutions, typically in the form
	of secured loans to corporate and asset-based borrowers, and may utilize structures such as sale leaseback transactions, direct
	asset purchases or other hybrid structures that it believes replicate the economics and risk profile of secured loans. MCC may
	also selectively make subordinated debt and equity investments in borrowers to which they have extended secured debt financing.
	MCC believes that its proposed investment strategy will allow it to generate cash available for distribution to its stockholders
	and to provide competitive total returns to its stockholders.


	 


	MCC’s business and affairs
	are managed under the direction of MCC’s board of directors (the “


	MCC Board


	”). The MCC
	Board currently consists of seven members, four of whom are Independent Directors.


	 


	Each of Brook Taube and
	Seth Taube

	 

	(the


	 “Principals”


	) and Jeff Tonkel serves as a director on
	the MCC Board. The MCC Board delegates daily management and investment authority to MCC Advisors pursuant to
	an investment management agreement (the


	 “Investment




	Management
	Agreement


	”). MCC Advisors also serves as MCC’s administrator pursuant to an administration agreement (the
	“


	Medley Administration Agreement


	”). Seth Taube is not an officer of MCC. Brook Taube serves as
	MCC’s Chief Executive Officer. Jeff Tonkel serves as Medley Management Inc.’s President. None of the Principals
	nor any members of Medley LLC’s senior management team will benefit directly or indirectly from any Co-Investment
	Transaction, other than by virtue of the ownership of securities of MCC and the Affiliated Investment Advisers, and none will
	participate individually in any Co-Investment Transaction.

	Medley SBIC, LP and Medley SBIC GP, LLC





	 


	Medley SBIC was organized as a limited
	partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on February 8, 2012, and submitted an application for a license to operate
	as an SBIC under the SBA Act with the SBA on December 9, 2011 (the “


	SBIC Application


	”). Medley SBIC
	has the same investment objective and strategies as MCC, as summarized above.


	 


	On March 26, 2013, Medley SBIC received an
	SBIC license from the SBA. As a result, MCC now has the ability to issue, through Medley SBIC, debentures guaranteed by the SBA
	at favorable interest rates. Medley SBIC will not be registered under the Act based on the exclusion from the definition of investment
	company contained in Section 3(c)(7). MCC directly owns a 100% limited partnership interest in Medley SBIC.


	 


	The SBIC General Partner was organized
	as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of Delaware on February 8, 2012, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of MCC, which is the sole member of the SBIC General Partner. Each of the Principals are managers of the SBIC General Partner.
	MCC may remove the managers of the SBIC General Partner at any time, with or without cause, subject to the approval of the SBA.


	 


	Medley SBIC is functionally a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of MCC because MCC and the SBIC General Partner (which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCC) own all of the equity and
	voting interests in Medley SBIC.


	 


	MCC effectively controls Medley SBIC because
	SBIC General Partner is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCC. MCC’s Board may remove the managers of SBIC General Partner with
	or without cause, subject to SBA approval. Moreover, MCC owns all of the limited partnership interests of Medley SBIC, and believes
	that its oversight of Medley SBIC is appropriate to protect MCC’s interests. Accordingly, the MCC Board effectively has the
	power to exercise authority and provides oversight with respect to Medley SBIC and will in fact exercise such authority and provide
	such oversight.


	 


	Subject to the overall supervision of the
	MCC Board, MCC Advisors will serve as the investment adviser to Medley SBIC pursuant to a management services agreement dated as
	of March 23, 2012 (as amended and re-approved from time to time by the MCC Board, the “


	Management Services Agreement


	”).


	 


	On March 27, 2012, MCC, Medley SBIC, the
	SBIC General Partner and MCC Advisors filed an application with the Commission for an order pursuant to Section 6(c) granting
	exemptions from Sections 18(a) and 61(a). On November 14, 2012, the Commission issued an order (the “


	SBIC Order


	”)

	9

	 
	permitting MCC to adhere to a modified asset coverage requirement under Section 61 with respect to any direct or indirect
	wholly owned subsidiary of MCC that is an SBIC and relies on section 3(c)(7) for an exemption from the definition of an “investment
	company” under the Act.

	Sierra Income Corporation





	 


	Sierra is an externally managed, non-diversified
	closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Act. Sierra filed a registration statement
	on Form N-2 (File No. 333-175624) under the 1933 Act in connection with its initial public offering, which became effective
	on April 16, 2012. Sierra is offering on a best efforts, continuous basis 150,000,000 shares of its common stock. In addition, Sierra intends to make an election to be treated for federal
	income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code, and intends to continue to make such election in the future. Sierra’s principal
	place of business is 280 Park Avenue, 6

	th

	 Floor East, New York, New York 10017.


	 


	Sierra’s investment objective is
	to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in the debt of privately-held U.S. companies with a
	focus on senior secured debt, second lien debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt. Sierra’s investments are made
	directly through Sierra, and may in the future be made through one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subs that Sierra may establish
	from time to time. Such Wholly-Owned Investment Subs will have Objectives and Strategies (as defined below) that are substantially
	the same as, or a subset of, those of Sierra, although the Wholly-Owned Investment Subs will be subject to different regulatory
	regimes. Sierra intends to originate transactions sourced through the existing network of its advisor, SIC Advisors, and expects
	to acquire debt securities through the secondary market. Sierra may make equity investments in companies but does not expect this
	to be a substantial portion of its portfolio.


	 


	Sierra’s business and
	affairs are managed under the direction of a board of directors (the 


	“Sierra Board


	”). The
	Sierra Board currently consists of five members, three of whom are Independent Directors.


	Each of the




	Principals serves as an interested director on the Sierra Board. Seth Taube also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of
	Sierra. Jeff Tonkel serves as the President of Sierra. The Sierra Board delegates daily management and investment authority
	to the SIC Advisors pursuant to an investment management agreement (the “


	Sierra Investment Management
	Agreement


	”). Medley Capital LLC serves as Sierra’s administrator pursuant to an administration
	agreement (the 


	“Sierra Administration Agreement


	”). The responsibilities of Medley Capital LLC
	under the Sierra Administration Agreement include overseeing Sierra’s financial records, preparing reports to Sierra
	stockholders and reports filed with the Commission, and generally monitoring the payment of Sierra’s expenses and the
	performance of administrative and professional services rendered to Sierra by others.

	Sierra Total Return Fund






	 



	STRF is
	an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. STRF will
	be operated as an interval fund. STRF filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No.s 811-23137 and 333-209496) under
	the 1940 Act and the 1933 Act in connection with its initial public offering. STRF is offering on a best efforts,
	continuous basis 100,000,000 shares of beneficial interest of STRF. In addition, STRF intends
	to make an election to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code, and intends to continue to make
	such election in the future. STRF’s principal place of business is 280 Park Avenue, 6th Floor East, New York, New York
	10017.


	 




	STRF’s Objectives
	and Strategies are similar to the Objectives and Strategies of each of the other Regulated Entities. STRF’s investment objective
	is to generate total return through a combination of current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio
	of debt securities and equities. STRF intends to meet its investment objectives by investing in the debt of U.S. companies with
	a focus on transactions sourced for STRF by STRF Advisors, including in fixed-income oriented funds. STRF anticipates that a substantial
	portion of its portfolio will consist of senior and subordinated debt. STRF’s debt investments may take the form of corporate
	loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by warrants, options or other forms of equity
	participation. STRF may also allocate capital for investment in any part of the capital structure, including distressed and more
	subordinated positions, where the STRF Advisors believes the borrower and the potential investment present an opportunity for
	risk-adjusted income and returns. STRF may separately purchase common or preferred equity interests in transactions. STRF’s
	portfolio is expected to include fixed-rate investments that generate absolute returns as well as floating-rate investments that
	allow coupons to rise in rising interest rate and inflationary environments. STRF may also invest in non-controlling interests
	in equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized debt obligations, which include collateralized bond
	obligations, collateralized loan obligations and other securitized products, that invest
	principally in loans and fixed-income instruments (or other instruments, including derivative instruments, with similar economic
	characteristics).


	 


	STRF’s business and affairs are
	managed under the direction of a board of trustees (the


	“STRF Board


	”). The STRF Board currently
	consists of five members, three of whom are Independent Directors. Each of the Principals serves as an interested trustee
	on the STRF Board. Seth Taube also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of STRF. Jeff Tonkel serves as the President of
	STRF. The STRF Board delegates daily management and investment authority to the STRF Advisors pursuant to an investment
	management agreement (the “


	STRF Investment Management Agreement

	II. 

	RELIEF FOR PROPOSED CO-INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS




	 







	A.




	Co-Investment in Portfolio Companies by the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds





	 


	It is anticipated that each Regulated Entity
	may co-invest in portfolio companies with one or more Affiliated Funds advised by the Affiliated Investment Advisers and/or one
	or more other Regulated Entities.


	 


	The Regulated Entity Advisers and the Regulated
	Entities believe that determining the allocation of a co-investment opportunity based on a 

	pro rata 

	share of the
	capital available for investment by the applicable Regulated Entities and the Participating Funds provides for the equitable allocation
	of co-investments and takes into account the current capacity of such Regulated Entities and Participating Funds to make the type
	of investment presented by the co-investment opportunity.


	 






	1.


	Reasons for Co-Investing




	 


	It is anticipated that co-investment in
	portfolio companies by the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds should increase the number of favorable investment opportunities
	for the Regulated Entities. The Co-Investment Program will be implemented if it is approved by a Required Majority (as defined
	below) of the applicable Regulated Entity.


	 


	The Regulated Entity Advisers expect that
	co-investment by the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, or among the Regulated Entities themselves, will provide the
	Regulated Entities with the ability to achieve greater diversification and, together with the Affiliated Funds, the opportunity
	to exercise greater influence on the portfolio companies in which the Regulated Entities and the Participating Funds co-invest.


	 


	A BDC that makes investments of the type
	contemplated by the Regulated Entities typically limits its participation in any one transaction to a specific dollar amount,
	which may be determined by legal or internally imposed limits on exposure in a single investment. In addition, the Code imposes
	diversification requirements on companies, such as the Regulated Entities, which seek certain favorable tax treatment under Subchapter
	M of the Code.

	10

	 In view of the foregoing, in cases when a Regulated Entity Adviser identifies investment opportunities
	requiring larger capital commitments it must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles. The availability
	of the Affiliated Funds and/or other Regulated Entities as investing partners of a Regulated Entity may alleviate the necessity
	in certain circumstances.


	 


	Without the opportunity for co-investment,
	each Regulated Entity, acting alone, might have to forego some investment opportunities if the respective Regulated Entity cannot
	provide all of the financing required by a potential portfolio company. Portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged
	by A Regulated Entity Adviser as a result of the Regulated Entity’s inability to commit the entire amount of financing required
	by the portfolio company in a timely manner. By reducing the number of instances in which a Regulated Entity’s individual
	or aggregate investment limits require the Regulated Entity Adviser to arrange a syndicated financing with unaffiliated entities,
	the Regulated Entities likely will be required to forego fewer attractive investment opportunities. With the assets of the Affiliated
	Funds along with the assets of the other Regulated Entities available for co-investment, there should be an increase in the number
	of opportunities accessible to each Regulated Entity.


	 






	 





	10


	See I.R.C. Section 851(b)(3).



	 









	10

	 







	 




	 


	The Regulated Entity Advisers and the Board
	of each of the Regulated Entities believe that it would be desirable for the Regulated Entities to co-invest with other Regulated
	Entities and with the Affiliated Funds, and that such investments would be consistent with the investment objective, investment
	policies, investment positions, investment strategies, investment restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other pertinent factors
	applicable to the Regulated Entities.


	 


	At least quarterly, the Board of each of
	the Regulated Entities will review the rationale for the Co-Investment Program and evaluate whether the program remains important
	to the Regulated Entities.


	 






	2.


	Mechanics of the Co-Investment Program




	 


	In selecting investments for each Regulated
	Entity, the Regulated Entity Advisers will consider the investment objective, investment policies, investment position, capital
	available for investment, and other factors relevant to the respective Regulated Entities they advise. Similarly, in selecting
	investments for the Affiliated Funds, the Affiliated Investment Adviser will choose investments separately for each entity, considering,
	in each case, the investment objective, investment policies, investment position, capital available for investment, and other factors
	relevant to that particular investing entity. The Regulated Entity Advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate
	investment for a Regulated Entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Entities and/or one
	or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification. The Regulated Entities, however,
	will not be obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to them.


	 


	The Regulated Entity Adviser, as applicable,
	will present each Proposed Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation of each investment opportunity to the directors
	of the relevant Regulated Entity’s Board that are eligible to vote under Section 57(o) (the “


	Eligible Directors


	”).
	The “required majority,” as defined in Section 57(o) (“


	Required Majority


	”) of a Regulated
	Entity will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the Regulated Entity. No Independent Director will
	have any direct or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction or any interest in any portfolio company, other
	than through an interest (if any) in the securities of the Regulated Entity.


	 


	All subsequent activity (i.e., exits or
	Follow-On Investments) in a Co-Investment Transaction will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
	Application.


	 









	11

	 







	 




	 



	A Regulated
	Entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority
	if, among other things: (i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and Affiliated Fund is proportionate to its outstanding
	investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the board
	of directors of the Regulated Entity has approved that Regulated Entity’s participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On
	Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity. If the Board has not given such approval in advance, any such
	disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Entity’s Eligible Directors.

	The Board of a
	Regulated Entity may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with
	the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.


	 


	The Co-Investment Program stipulates that
	the terms, conditions, price, class of securities, settlement date, and registration rights applicable to the applicable Regulated
	Entity’s purchase be the same as those applicable to the purchase by the other Regulated Entities and/or Participating Funds.


	 


	The amount of each Regulated Entity’s
	capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, if
	any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by the
	Board of the applicable Regulated Entity or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations. Likewise, an Affiliated
	Fund’s capital available for investment is determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves,
	if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the Affiliated Fund’s
	directors, general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.


	 







	B.




	Applicable Law





	 






	1.


	Sections 17(d), 57(a)(4) and 57(i), and Rule 17d-1




	 


	Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of
	the 1940 Act), or an affiliated person of such affiliated person, of a registered closed-end investment company acting as principal,
	from effecting any transaction in which the registered closed-end investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant,
	in contravention of such rules as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by
	the registered closed-end investment company on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participant.
	Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person
	(as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated
	person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing
	plan,” as defined in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application.


	 


	Similarly, with regard
	to BDCs, Section 57(a)(4) makes it unlawful for any person who is related to a BDC in a manner described in
	Section 57(b), acting as principal, knowingly to effect any transaction in which the BDC or a company controlled by such
	BDC is a joint or a joint and several participant with that person in contravention of rules and regulations as the
	Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by the BDC or controlled company on a basis
	less advantageous than that of the other participant. Although the Commission has not adopted any rules expressly under
	Section 57(a)(4), Section 57(i) provides that the rules under Section 17(d) applicable to registered
	closed-end investment companies (

	e.g.

	, Rule 17d-1) are, in the interim, deemed to apply to transactions subject
	to Section 57(a). Rule 17d-1, as made applicable to BDCs by Section 57(i), prohibits any person who is related
	to a BDC in a manner described in Section 57(b), as modified by Rule 57b-1, acting as principal, from participating
	in, or effecting any transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan
	in which the BDC or a company controlled by such BDC is a participant, unless an application regarding the joint enterprise,
	arrangement, or profit-sharing plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted by an order entered prior to the
	submission of the plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval, or prior to its adoption or modification
	if not so submitted.


	 









	12

	 







	 




	 


	In passing upon applications under Rule 17d-1,
	the Commission will consider whether the participation by the BDC or controlled company in such joint transaction is consistent
	with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from
	or less advantageous than that of other participants.


	 






	2.


	Section 57(b) and Rule 57b-1




	 


	Section 57(b), as modified by Rule 57b-1,
	specifies the persons to whom the prohibitions of Section 57(a)(4) apply. These persons include the following: (1) any
	director, officer, employee, or member of an advisory board of a BDC or any person (other than the BDC itself) who is, within the
	meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C), an affiliated person of any such person; or (2) any investment adviser or promoter of,
	general partner in, principal underwriter for, or person directly or indirectly either controlling, controlled by, or under common
	control with a BDC (except the BDC itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the BDC, would
	not be directly or indirectly under the control of a person who controls the BDC), or any person who is, within the meaning of
	Section 2(a)(3)(C) or (D), an affiliated person of such person.


	 


	Rule 57b-1 exempts certain persons
	otherwise related to a BDC in a manner described in Section 57(b)(2) from being subject to the prohibitions of Section 57(a). Specifically,
	this rule states that the provisions of Section 57(a) shall not apply to any person: (a) solely because that person
	is directly or indirectly controlled by a BDC; or (b) solely because that person is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled
	by, or under common control with, a person described in (a) of the rule or is an officer, director, partner, copartner, or
	employee of a person described in (a) of the rule.


	 


	Section 2(a)(9) defines “control”
	as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the
	result of an official position with such company. The statute also sets forth the interpretation that any person who owns
	beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25 percent of the voting securities of a company
	shall be presumed to control such company; any person who does not so own more than 25 percent of the voting securities of a company
	shall be presumed not to control such company; and a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person.


	 


	Sections 2(a)(3)(C) and (D) define
	an “affiliated person” of another person as: (C) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled
	by, or under common control with, such other person; and (D) any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such
	other person.


	 









	13

	 







	 




	 







	C.




	Need for Relief





	 


	Co-Investment Transactions may
	be prohibited by Sections 17(d) and/or 57(a)(4) and Rule 17d-1 without a prior order of the Commission to the extent
	that the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Entities fall within the category of persons described by
	Section 17(d) and Section 57(b), as modified by Rule 57b-1 thereunder, vis-à-vis each Regulated Entity.


	 


	First, the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated
	Funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3). An Existing Affiliated Investment Adviser
	is the investment adviser to each of the Affiliated Funds. A Regulated Entity Investment Adviser is the investment adviser to each
	of the Regulated Entities. The Existing Affiliated Investment Advisers and the Regulated Entity Advisers are each under the common
	control of Medley LLC. To the extent that the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds may be deemed to be controlled by or
	under the common control with the Regulated Entity Advisers, the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds may be deemed affiliated
	persons within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3).


	 


	Second, each Regulated Entity may be deemed
	to be affiliated persons of each other Regulated Entity within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3). A Regulated Entity Adviser
	is the investment adviser to each of the Regulated Entities. To the extent that a Regulated Entity may be deemed to be controlled
	by or under common control with each of the Regulated Entity Advisers, each Regulated Entity may be deemed affiliated persons of
	each other Regulated Entity within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3).


	 







	D.




	Requested Relief





	 


	Accordingly, Applicants respectfully request
	an Order of the Commission, pursuant to Sections 17(d) and 57(i) and Rule 17d-1, permitting (a) the Existing
	Affiliated Funds, and any Future Affiliated Funds, to participate with one or more Regulated Entities in Co-Investment Transactions,
	and (b) the Regulated Entities to participate in Co-Investment Transactions with each other.


	 







	E.




	Precedents





	 


	The Commission has granted co-investment
	relief on numerous occasions in recent years.

	11

	 Applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth as conditions
	for the relief requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited orders. We note,
	in particular, that the co-investment protocol to be followed by the Applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol
	followed by Medley Capital Corporation and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on November 25, 2013.

	12

	 We also note that
	the Commission has granted co-investment relief to permit a BDC and its SBIC subsidiary to co-invest with another fund.

	F.




	Applicants’ Legal Arguments





	 


	Rule 17d-1 was promulgated by the
	Commission pursuant to Section 17(d) and made applicable to BDCs by Section 57(i). Paragraph (a) of Rule 17d-1
	permits an otherwise prohibited person, acting as principal, to participate in, or effect a transaction in connection with, a joint
	enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which a BDC is a participant if an application regarding the joint
	enterprise, arrangement, or profit-sharing plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted by an order issued prior
	to the submission of such plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval, or prior to its adoption or modification
	if not so submitted. Paragraph (b) of Rule 17d-1 states that in passing upon applications under that rule, the Commission
	will consider whether the participation by the investment company in such joint enterprise, joint arrangement, or profit-sharing
	plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation
	is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.


	 


	Applicants submit that the fact that the
	Required Majority of each Regulated Entity will approve each Co-Investment Transaction before the investment is made, and other
	protective conditions set forth in this Application will ensure that the Regulated Entities will be treated fairly. Each Regulated
	Entity would have the ability to engage in Follow-On Investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other
	conditions.


	 


	If the Regulated Entity Advisers or
	the Principals, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Regulated Entity Advisers or the
	Principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “


	Holders


	”) own in the aggregate more than
	25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the “


	Shares


	”), then the Holders
	will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election of
	directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any other matter under either the Act or applicable
	state law affecting the Board’s composition, size or manner of election.


	 


	Applicants believe that this condition
	will ensure that the Independent Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability
	of the Regulated Entity Advisers or the Principals to influence the Independent Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied,
	that the Independent Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. The Independent Directors shall evaluate and approve
	any independent third party, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the shareholders,
	and other factors that they deem relevant.


	 









	15

	 







	 




	 


	The conditions to which the
	requested relief will be subject are designed to ensure that the Regulated Entity Advisers, the Affiliated Investment
	Advisers or the Principals would not be able to favor the Affiliated Funds over the Regulated Entities (or one Regulated
	Entity over another) through the allocation of investment opportunities among them. 

	To
	the extent there is an investment that falls within the Objectives and Strategies of a Regulated Entity and one or more other
	Regulated Entities and/or the investment objectives and strategies of one or more Affiliated Funds, it is expected that a
	Regulated Entity will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain
	exceptions based on available capital or diversification. The Regulated Entities, however, will not be obligated to invest,
	or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to them.

	Applicants submit that the Co-Investment Program
	presents an attractive alternative to the institution of some form of equitable allocation protocol for the allocation of
	100% of individual investment opportunities to either one Regulated Entity or the Affiliated Funds as opportunities
	arise.


	 


	Applicants submit that the Regulated Entities’
	participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and on
	a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. Applicants believe that the conditions
	will ensure that the Regulated Entity Advisers, the Affiliated Investment Advisers and the Principals would not be able to favor
	the Affiliated Funds over the Regulated Entities (or one Regulated Entity over another) through the allocation of investment opportunities
	among them because, as a guiding principle, the conditions permit a co-investment transaction only if the Eligible Directors have
	made a determination that the proposed investment would not benefit an affiliated person other than the fund participating in the
	transaction and then only to the extent strictly permitted by the conditions.


	 




	After making the determinations required
	in conditions 1 and 2(a), other than in the case of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided for in conditions
	7 and 8, the applicable Regulated Entity Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation
	to the Eligible Directors, and the Required Majority will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the
	Regulated Entity.


	 



	Applicants
	believe that participation by the Regulated Entities in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, as provided in conditions
	7 and 8, is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and will not be made on a basis different from or
	less advantageous than that of other participants. A formulaic approach, such as pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments,
	eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations, and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching
	and promotes fairness. 



	 







	G.




	Conditions





	 


	Applicants agree that any order of the
	Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:


	 


	1. Each time a Regulated Entity Adviser
	or an Affiliated Investment Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated
	Entity that falls within the then-current Objectives and Strategies of a Regulated Entity,

	13

	 the appropriate Regulated
	Entity Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the Regulated Entity in light
	of the Regulated Entity’s then-current circumstances.


	 


	2. (a) If a Regulated Entity Adviser deems
	a Regulated Entity’s participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for such Regulated Entity,
	it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for such Regulated Entity.



	 



	(b) If the aggregate amount recommended
	by Regulated Entity Advisers to be invested by the Regulated Entities in such Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with
	the amount proposed to be invested by each Participating Fund, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the
	investment opportunity, the amount proposed to be invested by each such party will be allocated among them 

	pro rata

	 based
	on each participating party’s capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed
	to be invested by each. The Regulated Entity Advisers will provide the respective Eligible Directors with information concerning
	each party’s available capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of such Regulated Entity’s investments
	for compliance with these allocation procedures.


	 






	 





	13


	“


	Objectives and Strategies


	” means the Regulated Entity’s investment objectives and strategies,
	as described in the Regulated Entity’s registration statement on Form N-2, other filings the Regulated Entity has made with
	the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or under the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, as amended, and the Regulated Entity’s reports to stockholders.



	 









	16

	 







	 




	 


	(c) After making the determinations required
	in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Regulated Entity Advisers will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment
	Transaction, including the amount proposed to be invested by each Regulated Entity and any Participating Fund, to the Eligible
	Directors of the each participating Regulated Entity for their consideration. A Regulated Entity will co-invest with another Regulated
	Entity and/or any Participating Fund only if, prior to participating in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority
	of the Regulated Entity concludes that:


	 


	(i)

	the terms
	of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Entity and its stockholders
	and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Entity or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned

	;


	 


	(ii)
	the transaction is consistent with


	 


	(A)
	the interests of the Regulated Entity’s stockholders; and


	 


	(B) the Regulated Entity’s
	then-current Objectives and Strategies.


	 


	(iii) the investment by another Regulated
	Entity or one or more Participating Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Entity, and participation by such Regulated Entity
	is not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of any Participating Fund or other Regulated Entity; 

	provided

	that, if any Participating Fund or other Regulated Entity, but not the Regulated Entity itself, gains the right to nominate
	a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar
	right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit
	the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if


	 


	(A) the Eligible Directors shall
	have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;


	 


	(B) the Regulated Entity Adviser
	agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Board of the applicable Regulated Entity with respect to the actions of such
	director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate
	in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and


	 


	(C) any fees or other compensation
	that any other Regulated Entity or any Participating Fund or any affiliated person of either receives in connection with the right
	of a Participating Fund or other Regulated Entity to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate
	in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among any Participating Funds (who may,
	in turn, share their portion with their affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Entities in accordance with the amount
	of each party’s investment; and


	 









	17

	 







	 




	 


	(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated
	Entity will not benefit the Regulated Entity Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or other Regulated Entities, or any affiliated person
	of any of them (other than the other parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (a) to the extent permitted by condition
	13; (b) to the extent permitted by Sections 17(e) or 57(k), as applicable; (c) indirectly, as a result of an interest
	in securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction; or (d) in the case of fees or other compensation
	described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).


	 


	3. Each Regulated Entity has the right
	to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.


	 


	4. The Regulated Entity Advisers will present
	to the Board of each Regulated Entity, as applicable, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment
	Transactions made by the Affiliated Funds and other Regulated Entities during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated
	Entity’s then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the respective Regulated Entity, and an explanation
	of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Entity. All information presented to the Board pursuant
	to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Entity and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination
	by the Commission and its staff.


	 


	5. Except for Follow-On Investments made
	pursuant to condition 8 below

	14

	, a Regulated Entity will not invest in reliance on the Order in any portfolio company
	in which any other Regulated Entity, any Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person of any other Regulated Entity or Affiliated
	Fund is an existing investor.


	 


	6. A Regulated Entity will not participate
	in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement
	date and registration rights will be the same for such Regulated Entity as for the Participating Funds and/or other Regulated Entities.
	The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Entity, but not such Regulated Entity, of the right to nominate a director
	for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar
	rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition
	6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.


	 


	7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or Participating
	Fund elects to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction,
	then:


	 


	(i) the investment adviser to such Regulated
	Entity or Participating Fund will notify each other Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the
	proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and


	 






	 







	14

	This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments
	by a Regulated Entity in issuers in which that Regulated Entity already holds investments. 


	 









	18

	 







	 




	 


	(ii) the investment adviser to each other
	Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction will formulate a recommendation as to participation by such
	Regulated Entity in the disposition.


	 


	(b) Each Regulated Entity will have the
	right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those
	applicable to any Participating Funds and any other Regulated Entities.


	 


	(c) A Regulated Entity
	may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the
	proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and the Participating Funds in such disposition is proportionate to its
	outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the applicable Regulated
	Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the applicable Regulated Entity the ability to participate in such
	dispositions on a 

	pro rata

	 basis (as described in greater detail in this Application); and (iii) the
	Board of the applicable Regulated Entity is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all Follow-On Investments made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the applicable Regulated Entity Adviser will provide
	its written recommendation as to such Regulated Entity’s participation to the Eligible Directors, and such Regulated
	Entity will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in such
	Regulated Entity’s best interests.


	 


	(d) Each Regulated Entity and each of the
	Participating Funds will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.


	 


	8. (a) If any Regulated Entity or Participating
	Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction,
	then:


	 


	(i) the investment adviser to such Regulated
	Entity or Participating Fund will notify each other Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the
	proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and


	 


	(ii) the investment adviser to each other
	Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction will formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation,
	including the amount of the proposed investment, by such Regulated Entity.


	 


	(b) A Regulated Entity may
	participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed
	participation of each Regulated Entity and Participating Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding
	investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; (ii) the Board of the applicable Regulated
	Entity has approved as being in the best interests of such Regulated Entity the ability to participate in Follow-On
	Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this Application); and (iii) the Board of the applicable Regulated Entity is provided on a quarterly
	basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the
	applicable Regulated Entity Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to such Regulated Entity’s participation
	to the Eligible Directors, and such Regulated Entity will participate in such follow-on investment solely to the extent that
	a Required Majority determines that it is in such Regulated Entity’s best interests.


	 









	19

	 







	 




	 


	(c) If, with respect to any follow-on
	investment:


	 


	(i) the amount of the opportunity is not
	based on the Regulated Entities’ and the Participating Funds’ outstanding investments immediately preceding the follow-on
	investment; and


	 


	(ii) the aggregate amount recommended
	by the applicable Regulated Entity Adviser to be invested by each Regulated Entity in such Co-Investment Transaction, together
	with the amount proposed to be invested by the Participating Funds and/or other Regulated Entity, collectively, in the same transaction,
	exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, then the amount to be invested by each such party will be allocated among them 

	pro
	rata

	 based on each party’s capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount
	proposed to be invested by each.


	 


	(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered
	a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and be subject to the other conditions set forth in the Application.


	 


	9. The Independent Directors of each Regulated
	Entity will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment
	Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Entity considered
	but declined to participate in, so that the Independent Directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding
	quarter, including those investments that the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions
	of the Order. In addition, the Independent Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for
	the Regulated Entities of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.


	 


	10.

	Each Regulated
	Entity will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) as if each of the Regulated Entities were a BDC and each of the
	investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f).




	 




	11. No Independent
	Director of a Regulated Entity will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated
	person” (as defined in the Act) of, any of the Affiliated Funds.




	 




	12. The expenses,
	if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including,
	without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the 1933 Act) shall, to
	the extent not payable by the Regulated Entity Advisers or the Affiliated Investment Advisers under their respective investment
	advisory agreements with the Regulated Entities and the Participating Funds, be shared by the applicable Regulated Entities and
	the Participating Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of their securities held or being acquired or disposed of, as the
	case may be.




	 










	20

	 







	 




	 



	13. Any
	transaction fee (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding brokers’ fees contemplated by
	Section 57(k)(2) or 17(e)(2), as applicable) received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed
	to the applicable Regulated Entities and the Participating Funds on a 

	pro rata

	 basis based on the amounts
	each invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by a
	Regulated Entity Adviser or an Affiliated Investment Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be
	deposited into an account maintained by the Regulated Entity Adviser or such other adviser, as the case may be, at a bank or
	banks having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1), and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest
	that will also be divided 

	pro rata 

	among each applicable Regulated Entity and each Participating Fund based
	on the amount each invests in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, Regulated Entity Advisers,
	Affiliated Investment Advisers, or any affiliated person of any of the Regulated Entities will receive additional
	compensation or remuneration of any kind (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Entities and the Participating
	Funds, the 

	pro rata

	transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in
	condition 2(c)(iii)(C) and (b) in the case of the Regulated Entity Advisers and the Affiliated Advisers, investment
	advisory fees paid in accordance with the Regulated Entities’ and Affiliated Funds’ governing agreements) as a
	result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction.



	 


	14. If the Regulated Entity Advisers,
	the Principals, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Regulated Entity Advisers or the Principals,
	and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “


	Holders


	”) own in the aggregate more than 25% of the outstanding
	voting securities of a Regulated Entity (“


	Shares


	”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed
	by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election
	of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any other matter under either the Act or applicable state
	law affecting the Board’s composition, size or manner of election.


	 


	15.

	The Regulated
	Entity Advisers and the Affiliated Investment Advisers will maintain written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
	compliance with the foregoing conditions. These policies and procedures will require, among other things, that each Regulated
	Entity Adviser will be notified of all Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within the then-current Objectives and Strategies
	of any Regulated Entity it advises and will be given sufficient information to make its independent determination and recommendations
	under conditions 1, 2(a), 7 and 8.

	EXHIBIT A



	Resolution of the Board of Directors
	of




	MEDLEY CAPITAL CORPORATION



	 





	WHEREAS

	, the U.S. Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the “


	SEC


	”) granted the Company an exemptive order on November 25, 2013 (the “


	Prior
	Order


	”) pursuant to Sections 57(a)(4) and 57(i) and Rule 17d-1 permitting certain joint transactions that otherwise
	may be prohibited by Section 57(a)(4);


	 



	WHEREAS

	, management
	of the Company believes that it would be in the Company’s best interest to expand the scope of the Prior Order to allow the
	Company to enter into co-investment transactions with investment companies that are registered under the Investment Company Act
	of 1940, as amended (the “


	1940 Act


	”) and whose investment adviser is MCC Advisors, (ii) SIC Advisors,
	or (iii) any future investment adviser that Medley LLC controls, in addition to the existing and future business development companies
	and private funds currently covered by the Prior Order, and had such an expanded application prepared by counsel (the


	“New
	Exemptive Application”


	);


	 



	WHEREAS

	, the
	Board has reviewed the New Exemptive Application, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, for an order of the SEC (the


	“New Order”


	) pursuant to Sections 17(d) and 57(i) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 17d-1 promulgated under the
	1940 Act, permitting certain joint transactions that otherwise may be prohibited by either or both of Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4);


	 



	WHEREAS,

	the Board deems it advisable
	and in the best interest of the Company that the Company file the New Exemptive Application; and


	 



	WHEREAS

	, the
	Company will continue to rely on the Prior Order until the SEC issues the New Order, at which point the Company will cease relying
	on the Prior Order;


	 



	NOW, THEREFORE,
	BE IT RESOLVED

	, that the officers, shall be, and each of them individually hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed, in
	the name and on behalf of the Company, to cause to be executed, delivered and filed with the SEC the New Exemptive Application,
	in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A;



	 




	FURTHER RESOLVED

	,
	that the officers shall be, and each of them individually hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed, in the name and on behalf
	of the Company, to cause to be made, executed, delivered and filed with the SEC any amendments to the New Exemptive Application
	and any additional applications for exemptive relief as are determined necessary, advisable or appropriate by any of the officers
	in order to effectuate the foregoing resolutions, such determination to be conclusively evidenced by the taking of any such action;



	 




	FURTHER RESOLVED

	,
	that all acts and things previously done by any of the officers, on or prior to the date hereof, in the name and on behalf of the
	Company in connection with the foregoing resolutions are in all respects authorized, ratified, approved, confirmed and adopted
	as the acts and deeds by and on behalf of the Company; and


	 



	FURTHER RESOLVED

	,
	that the officers be, and each of them hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed to certify and deliver copies of these resolutions
	to such governmental bodies, agencies, persons, firms or corporations as the officers may deem necessary and to identify by his
	or her signature or certificate, or in such form as may be required, the documents and instruments presented to and approved herein

	EXHIBIT B



	Resolution of the Board of Directors
	of




	SIERRA INCOME CORPORATION



	 





	WHEREAS

	, the U.S. Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the “


	SEC


	”) granted the Company an exemptive order on November 25, 2013 (the “


	Prior
	Order


	”) pursuant to Sections 57(a)(4) and 57(i) and Rule 17d-1 permitting certain joint transactions that otherwise
	may be prohibited by Section 57(a)(4);


	 



	WHEREAS

	, management
	of the Company believes that it would be in the Company’s best interest to expand the scope of the Prior Order to allow the
	Company to enter into co-investment transactions with investment companies that are registered under the Investment Company Act
	of 1940, as amended (the “


	1940 Act


	”) and whose investment adviser is MCC Advisors, (ii) SIC Advisors,
	or (iii) any future investment adviser that Medley LLC controls, in addition to the existing and future business development companies
	and private funds currently covered by the Prior Order, and had such an expanded application prepared by counsel (the


	“New
	Exemptive Application”


	);


	 



	WHEREAS

	, the
	Board has reviewed the New Exemptive Application, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, for an order of the SEC (the


	“New Order”


	) pursuant to Sections 17(d) and 57(i) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 17d-1 promulgated under the
	1940 Act, permitting certain joint transactions that otherwise may be prohibited by either or both of Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4);


	 



	WHEREAS,

	the Board deems it advisable
	and in the best interest of the Company that the Company file the New Exemptive Application; and


	 



	WHEREAS

	, the
	Company will continue to rely on the Prior Order until the SEC issues the New Order, at which point the Company will cease relying
	on the Prior Order;


	 



	NOW, THEREFORE,
	BE IT RESOLVED

	, that the officers, shall be, and each of them individually hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed, in
	the name and on behalf of the Company, to cause to be executed, delivered and filed with the SEC the New Exemptive Application,
	in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A;



	 




	FURTHER RESOLVED

	,
	that the officers shall be, and each of them individually hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed, in the name and on behalf
	of the Company, to cause to be made, executed, delivered and filed with the SEC any amendments to the New Exemptive Application
	and any additional applications for exemptive relief as are determined necessary, advisable or appropriate by any of the officers
	in order to effectuate the foregoing resolutions, such determination to be conclusively evidenced by the taking of any such action;



	 




	FURTHER RESOLVED

	,
	that all acts and things previously done by any of the officers, on or prior to the date hereof, in the name and on behalf of the
	Company in connection with the foregoing resolutions are in all respects authorized, ratified, approved, confirmed and adopted

	FURTHER RESOLVED

	,
	that the officers be, and each of them hereby is, authorized, empowered and directed to certify and deliver copies of these resolutions
	to such governmental bodies, agencies, persons, firms or corporations as the officers may deem necessary and to identify by his
	or her signature or certificate, or in such form as may be required, the documents and instruments presented to and approved herein
	and to furnish evidence of the approval, by an officer authorized to give such approval, of any document, instrument or provision
	or any addition, deletion or change in any document or instrument.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
