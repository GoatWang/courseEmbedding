					Full Description



Egalet Corporation, incorporated on August 21, 2013, is a specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing, manufacturing and commercializing treatments for pain and other conditions. The Company's products include OXAYDO and SPRIX Nasal Spray. The Company is developing two late-stage product candidates, ARYMO ER and Egalet-002 using Guardian Technology. Its Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet technology that utilizes a manufacturing process, injection molding, which results in tablets with controlled-release properties, as well as physical and chemical features that have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of manipulation. Its Guardian Technology can be used to create tablets. Its Guardian Technology platform, which combines abuse-deterrent features and precision delivery, is applied across various classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with similar or different release profiles.SPRIX Nasal SprayThe Company's product SPRIX Nasal Spray, which contains ketorolac tromethamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated in adult patients for the short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. SPRIX is absorbed through the nasal mucosa.OXAYDOThe Company's product OXAYDO is an approved immediate-release (IR) oxycodone product formulated to deter abuse through snorting. OXAYDO is indicated for the management of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.ARYMO ERThe Company's product candidate, ARYMO ER is an abuse-deterrent (AD), extended-release (ER), oral morphine formulation. ARYMO ER is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.Egalet-002The Company's product candidate, Egalet-002, is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation. Its Egalet-002 product candidate is in Phase III development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Using its Guardian Technology, the Company has developed Egalet 002 to address common methods of abuse and misuse, including crushing in order to swallow, snort or smoke, or dissolving in order to inject. Egalet-002 tablets are designed with an inner matrix, composed of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and polyethylene oxide (PEO), which is surrounded by an outer inert shell, composed of Polylactic acid (PLA).The Company competes with Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Mallinckrodt Inc., Pfizer, Purdue Pharma L.P., Purdue Pharmaceuticals L.P., The P.F. Laboratories, Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, Actavis, Inc., Acura, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hospira, Inc., Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, Intellipharmaceutics International Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Rhoades Pharmaceuticals, Mylan, Pain Therapeutic, Zogenix and QRxPharma Ltd.

Egalet's stock plunges toward record low after stock offering plan
Shares of Egalet Corp.  plunged 27% toward a record low in premarket trade Thursday, after the developer of pain treatment drugs announced a public offering of common stock. The company said late Wednesday the size of the offering was subject to market conditions. The company had 25.6 million shares outstanding as of May 10. Egalet said it plans to use the proceeds of the offering to support commercial sales and marketing with respect to Arymo ER (morphine sulfate) extended-release tablets for oral use, Sprix (ketorolac tromethamine) nasal spray and Oxaydo (oxycodone HCI) tables and for general corporate purposes. The stock was trading at $1.85, below the previous record close of $2.14 on June 1. The stock has plummeted 67% year to date through Wednesday, while the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has climbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Egalet's stock plunges toward record low after stock offering plan
Shares of Egalet Corp.  plunged 27% toward a record low in premarket trade Thursday, after the developer of pain treatment drugs announced a public offering of common stock. The company said late Wednesday the size of the offering was subject to market conditions. The company had 25.6 million shares outstanding as of May 10. Egalet said it plans to use the proceeds of the offering to support commercial sales and marketing with respect to Arymo ER (morphine sulfate) extended-release tablets for oral use, Sprix (ketorolac tromethamine) nasal spray and Oxaydo (oxycodone HCI) tables and for general corporate purposes. The stock was trading at $1.85, below the previous record close of $2.14 on June 1. The stock has plummeted 67% year to date through Wednesday, while the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has climbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Egalet Corporation is a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on the commercialization and development of abuse resistant formulations of opioids and other pain care drugs. It was founded as a private company in 1995 in Værløse, Denmark, and now operates as a publicly traded American company headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania, a suburb west of the city of Philadelphia. The consolidated company has offices in the UK, the United, and Denmark. All research, development, and manufacturing is carried out in the Denmark offices. Egalet trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the trading symbol EGLT.[4]

Mechanism of action[edit]
Egalet has developed one of the world’s first erosion based pill that allows for the controlled release of drugs. The unconventionally shaped pill is made up of an inner matrix which contains the active ingredient and an outer coating shell made up of specific polymers.
The matrix, or inner portion of the pill, contains the dispersed drug. The matrix is designed to erode when it comes into contact with water but not until the desired point of release in order to avoid hydrolysis and the reduction of enzymatic activity.[5][6] The active substance is then released with a zero order release which ensures that a steady amount of the drug is released over time.[5] This minimizes fluctuations while maximizing the amount of time the drug remains within the therapeutic window.
The matrix is protected by the outer shell coating made of polymers similar to those used in plastic. More specifically, the shell is made up of a cellulose derivative with thermoplastic properties.[6] This derivative is basically insoluble in an aqueous solution.[6] The shell also contains a second cellulose derivative which is soluble in an aqueous solution, a plasticizer which promotes plasticity and reduces brittleness, and a filler which increases volume.[6] The outer shell protects the inner matrix making it an ideal system for chemically unstable substances, those with low melting and boiling points, and water-insoluble compounds.[6] Also, this protective shell significantly increases the shelf life of the substance.[6] The shell composition allows for controlled release of the matrix in both the stomach and the intestines despite the varying pH, agitation, etc.[6]
Once ingested the shell is separated from the matrix through water diffusion, polymer hydration, disentanglement, and dissolution, and the matrix can then carry out its intended function.[5]
By altering the composition of the shell and matrix, many drug formulations and ways of release can be achieved. The altering of the shape and surface area of the pill can also affect release times.[5] The pills are made with injection molding, similar to plastic molding, in order to complete the creation process in one fluid step.[5] They are the first company to manufacture pharmaceuticals using this technology. Injection molding is accurate, easy to reproduce (for manufacturing large quantities), has a low cost of production, and allows for simple technology transfer. The process is actually quite simple. First, the cavity starts off empty. Then, the piston moves forward, creating the shape for the shell, and the coating material is injected.[5] Next, the material hardens, and the matrix material that contains the drug is injected while the piston is recedes.[5] Finally, the matrix hardens while the piston ejects the finished tablet.[5]
The matrix[edit]
Egalet has perfected the formation of an amorphous state of the active ingredient. An amorphous state requires the formation of a higher energy solid state form.[5] Creating an amorphous form of dispersion is important in order to be able to use poorly water-soluble drugs as well as to improve oral bioavailability. The current pill enables the control of this amorphous phase as well as the controlled release of the active substance from the coated matrix system.[5]
The inner matrix has been designed for improved bioavailability, for specific situations where an insoluble active substance is needed, and to prevent abuse or misuse of the matrix.
The matrix composition is made up of the following: 1. a mixture of a first (polyethylene glycols and/or polyethylene oxides) and second polymers (block co-polymer of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide) that have plasticizing characteristics.[5] The melting points of the polymers are at the most 200 °C.[5] The combination of the polyethylene oxides and the blocking co-polymer enable the control of the amorphous state.[5] Some examples of the second block polymers used include poly(ethylene-glycol-b-(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-b-ethylene glycol (PEG-PLGA PEG), poly((DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-g-ethylene glycol) (PLGA-g-PEG), poloxamers and polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide (PEO-PPO).[5] 2. a therapeutically, and/or diagnostically active substance.[5]
Polymer coating[edit]
The first polymer is a polyethylene glycol and/or a polyethylene oxide.[5] Polyethylene glycols (which are denoted as polyethylene oxides when the molecular weight is above about 100,000) are mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene glycol.[5] In preferable conditions, the first polymer has a molecular weight of about 35,000 daltons.[5] Mixtures of PEG’s may be used to get the ideal molecular weight for specific formulations.[5]

More specifically, the shell is made up of a cellulose derivative with thermoplastic properties.[6] This derivative is basically insoluble in an aqueous solution.[6] The shell also contains a second cellulose derivative which is soluble in an aqueous solution, a plasticizer which promotes plasticity and reduces brittleness, and a filler which increases volume.[6] The outer shell protects the inner matrix making it an ideal system for chemically unstable substances, those with low melting and boiling points, and water-insoluble compounds.[6] Also, this protective shell significantly increases the shelf life of the substance.[6] The shell composition allows for controlled release of the matrix in both the stomach and the intestines despite the varying pH, agitation, etc.[6]
Once ingested the shell is separated from the matrix through water diffusion, polymer hydration, disentanglement, and dissolution, and the matrix can then carry out its intended function.[5]
By altering the composition of the shell and matrix, many drug formulations and ways of release can be achieved. The altering of the shape and surface area of the pill can also affect release times.[5] The pills are made with injection molding, similar to plastic molding, in order to complete the creation process in one fluid step.[5] They are the first company to manufacture pharmaceuticals using this technology. Injection molding is accurate, easy to reproduce (for manufacturing large quantities), has a low cost of production, and allows for simple technology transfer. The process is actually quite simple. First, the cavity starts off empty. Then, the piston moves forward, creating the shape for the shell, and the coating material is injected.[5] Next, the material hardens, and the matrix material that contains the drug is injected while the piston is recedes.[5] Finally, the matrix hardens while the piston ejects the finished tablet.[5]
The matrix[edit]
Egalet has perfected the formation of an amorphous state of the active ingredient. An amorphous state requires the formation of a higher energy solid state form.[5] Creating an amorphous form of dispersion is important in order to be able to use poorly water-soluble drugs as well as to improve oral bioavailability. The current pill enables the control of this amorphous phase as well as the controlled release of the active substance from the coated matrix system.[5]
The inner matrix has been designed for improved bioavailability, for specific situations where an insoluble active substance is needed, and to prevent abuse or misuse of the matrix.
The matrix composition is made up of the following: 1. a mixture of a first (polyethylene glycols and/or polyethylene oxides) and second polymers (block co-polymer of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide) that have plasticizing characteristics.[5] The melting points of the polymers are at the most 200 °C.[5] The combination of the polyethylene oxides and the blocking co-polymer enable the control of the amorphous state.[5] Some examples of the second block polymers used include poly(ethylene-glycol-b-(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-b-ethylene glycol (PEG-PLGA PEG), poly((DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-g-ethylene glycol) (PLGA-g-PEG), poloxamers and polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide (PEO-PPO).[5] 2. a therapeutically, and/or diagnostically active substance.[5]
Polymer coating[edit]
The first polymer is a polyethylene glycol and/or a polyethylene oxide.[5] Polyethylene glycols (which are denoted as polyethylene oxides when the molecular weight is above about 100,000) are mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene glycol.[5] In preferable conditions, the first polymer has a molecular weight of about 35,000 daltons.[5] Mixtures of PEG’s may be used to get the ideal molecular weight for specific formulations.[5]

Egalet acquires pain products Oxaydo and Sprix


January 14, 2015 


‌​











	WAYNE, Penn. — Egalet Corp. last week announced the licensing and acquisition of two pain products. Egalet has agreed to license worldwide rights to Oxaydo (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only -CII, the first and only approved immediate-release oxycodone product formulated to deter abuse via snorting from Acura Pharmaceuticals, the company stated. The drug is approved in the United States for the management of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain. 

	 

	Additionally, Egalet acquired Sprix (ketorolac tromethamine) nasal spray from Luitpold Pharmaceuticals. The spray is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used as a short-term treatment for moderate to moderately severe pain that requires anaglesia at the opioid level. 

	 

	“The license and acquisition of Oxaydo and Sprix, two approved innovative pain treatments, helps transform Egalet into a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company in advance of the approval of our highly differentiated, late-stage pipeline of abuse-deterrent, extended-release products,” said Bob Radie, president and CEO of Egalet. “These products, an immediate-release opioid formulated to deter abuse and a nasal spray NSAID delivering pain relief at an opioid level, are natural fits given our focus on providing patients treatment options for pain that may help deter abuse and misuse, as well as accelerate our path to revenue generation and profitability.”

	 

	Egalet will assume responsibility of Sprix and begin promotional efforts in the first quarter of 2015, the company stated. Egalet is set to launch Oxaydo in the third quarter of 2015.
