SelectQuote Review: An Easy Way to Buy Life Insurance

						Posted on October 4, 2016 by John Schmoll in

This post may contain affiliate links. Please read my disclosure page for more info.


This article was sponsored by SelectQuote, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.
Buying life insurance is right up there with going to the dentist. We know we need it, but we can think of a million things that are more fun. Should this hold us back from buying life insurance? In a word, no! Having worked in the life insurance industry myself I’ve seen first hand what happens to families when an earner passes unexpectedly.
They’re left on their own to figure out how to meet their day-to-day needs, not to mention their future needs. As a small business owner, husband and father, I believe buying life insurance is one of the most important and loving things I can do. If you’re in the market for life insurance, this overview of SelectQuote will show you how many of the preconceived notions you may have about life insurance are worth rethinking.
How Does SelectQuote Work?
 
Years ago it was a time intensive process to buy life insurance. You had to meet with a salesperson, fill out a lengthy paper application and then wait to get your quote. Technology has greatly reduced the pain of applying for life insurance. SelectQuote harnesses that technology to simplify the entire life insurance purchase process so you can have your quote in a matter of minutes.
This is how SelectQuote is able to provide actionable information in such a short time period. SelectQuote does not sell their own product; rather they act as a kind of automated life insurance broker. SelectQuote works with over 20 reputable life insurance companies to find you the best rate possible, which is great for someone who wants to pay the lowest price.
I went through the process of applying for life insurance myself through SelectQuote. You go to the SelectQuote site and answer ten simple questions. They ask for things like age, weight, medical background information and the level of coverage you want. The process took me maybe five minutes total. SelectQuote gives you a case number and assigns a representative to reach out to you within 24 hours.
I was called within 8-10 hours by a representative who asked a few more follow-up questions. In total, our phone conversation was roughly ten minutes and he was able to provide me quotes from A+ rated providers at the end of our call. The lowest quote was $29.44 per month for a 20-year $250,000 term life insurance policy, which is in line with quotes I’ve received from other providers.
Within 15 minutes of getting off the phone, my SelectQuote representative emailed me three other quotes representing a variety of other coverage options. I loved this as it gave me the information I needed to compare different options and decide what solution is best for my family.
You may wonder what type of coverage SelectQuote offers. They offer only term life coverage. I’ve covered in-depth the value of term life insurance in the past and SelectQuote holds to the same solid principles, which may be part of the reason they are the top term life insurance agency in the country. SelectQuote offers 10, 15, 20 and 30-year plan options and over $5 million in coverage so you have plenty of flexibility through SelectQuote.
Going Beyond Life Insurance
 
It’s easy to think that life insurance is the main type of coverage you need for your needs. That’s not the case as you may need anything from auto insurance, homeowner’s/renters insurance or disability insurance, to name a few. SelectQuote knows this and doesn’t stop at just life insurance.
SelectQuote offers three additional types of insurance coverage. Those are:

Auto Insurance
Homeowner’s Insurance
Medicare Supplement Insurance

I don’t currently have need for any of those coverage options though they operate similar to life insurance through SelectQuote. They work with only A- to A+ carriers and find the best rates possible to help you save money.

The Importance of Life Insurance
 
We think we’re invincible; we’re not. It’s easy to put off buying life insurance because we think it’s not needed or that it’s too expensive. However, our financial responsibility does not end when we die. As a parent or spouse you have many obligations to continue to care for with your family after your passing, such as:

Paying off your house
Paying off any other outstanding debt
College for your children
Retirement needs

There are other needs you may need to provide for, but these are among the most important. Life insurance helps care for those needs and provide peace of mind that your loved ones won’t have to suffer. A 2015 LIMRA study shows that half of families would feel the financial impact of losing a primary income earner within the first year. Life insurance helps lessen that sting.
What if you’re young or single? Do you still need life insurance? I would argue that in most cases, you do. Not all debt dies with you and you may have other outstanding obligations. Then there’s the funeral. The average funeral costs over $7,200. Without life insurance your family is on the hook for those expenses.
You may think life insurance is too expensive to buy. The aforementioned LIMRA study reveals that 65 percent of people think life insurance is too expensive. In many cases that simply isn’t true. Taking a look at my quote, I could have $250,000 in coverage for less than $30 per month. That’s less than a tank of gas. If you’re younger than I am, you can get coverage for significantly cheaper because you lock in lower rates due to your age.
You may think life insurance isn’t important, but in many cases it’s a vital part of financial health. Go to SelectQuote today to see what kind of rates you can get.
 
Do you think life insurance is important to have? Why do you think so many believe life insurance is too expensive? Would your family be in need upon your untimely passing?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
