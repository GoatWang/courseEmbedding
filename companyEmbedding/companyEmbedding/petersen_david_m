What does it mean when an attorney is Board Certified?In 1974 the Supreme Court of Texas, recognized that the practice of law had become so specialized, that the old fashioned Texas general practitioner could no longer keep themselves properly up to date with all the changes in the field of law, the Supreme Court appointed a committee to study its concerns. The objective was to help people needing legal representation for a specific problem to be able to find an attorney who possessed special competence in that area. The Court decided that Texas should recognize areas of specialization and that they should be regulated. It formed the Texas Board of Legal Specialization to set the standards for certification.We are all too familiar with seeing or hearing ads on television or radio, urging potential viewers to call the attorney to help you recover money for injuries or injustices you may have suffered. The attorney claims to have your best interest at heart – some even offer to visit you in the hospital or represent that the attorney does not get paid until you collect. The ads may include individuals singing praises over what is proclaimed to be generous awards. Often, in very small print or spoken impossibly fast, you will then hear, “Not certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.” This does not mean, as some may think, that the attorney is not licensed. The attorney may well be licensed to practice any type of law throughout the state. Other solicitations may identify that a particular attorney is Board Certified. Why is this so important?Board Certified is not mandatory in the state of Texas. Attorneys who have become Board Certified means they voluntarily decide to become specialized. Only a little more than ten percent of Texas attorneys are Board Certified. Because the Texas program is nationally recognized as one of the most outstanding legal specialization programs in the country, many states send representatives to Austin for help in setting up their own specialization programs.To become board certified in one of the eighteen recognized fields, an attorney must have been practicing law in Texas full-time for five years. In addition, that attorney must have practiced in the specialized area for at least three years and devote a certain percentage of his practice to that area.The candidate for certification must also provide the Board with the names of judges and attorneys who are familiar with the attorney and his actual experience in that area. The Board may also go to other judges and lawyers to obtain more information about the candidate. The attorney applying for Board Certification must have completed sixty hours of approved Continuing Legal Education courses in the area of specialization within a prescribed time period. And finally, and most important of all, the candidate must pass a rigorous six hour examination to demonstrate his knowledge of the law in that specialty. Successful candidates are certified for five years.Like Board Certified Medical Specialists, Board Certified Attorneys are not expected to be infallible. The Supreme Court only wants the attorney to demonstrate “special competence” in the selected area. The purpose of Board Certification is to help the public find an attorney who is experienced in tax matters, bankruptcy, personal injury, or any of the other recognized areas of specialization.Even after an attorney receives a certificate of special competence, he must reapply every five years for recertification. While no exam is required, the attorney must attend at least 100 hours of Continuing Legal Education in that particular field and submit the names of judges and attorneys who are familiar with him in his field of specialization. The applicant for recertification must attest that he devoted a minimum percentage of his total practice to the specialty in each of the past five years. The disclaimer in the ads is to prevent the public from assuming that a non-certified attorney is certified just because he practices a particular specialty. With the rigorous requirements to become certified, it is easy to see why the Texas program of specialization is so esteemed throughout the nation. Attorneys who fulfill the requirements have demonstrated an exceptionally high level of dedication and competence in their clients’ representation. 







Contingency versus hourly fee?Attorneys are usually paid either on a hourly fee arrangement or on contingency. When an attorney is paid hourly, the client is usually expected to pay a certain amount of money up front, called a retainer, which is held in trust by the attorney who bills against the retainer trust account. The client may be required to deposit additional funds as the case proceeds. If the attorney is operating under a contingency agreement, then there is usually not a retainer and the client normally is not required to come up with any monetary funds. The attorney is paid based upon the amount recovered, which fees usually vary between 25 - 50 % of the gross recovery based upon several different factors. Most personal injury cases are handled on a contingency theory and there can also be hybrids of both arrangements. Remember however, there are certain types of cases which the State of Texas does not allow the lawyer to be compensated on a contingency basis such as in family law and criminal cases. At The Law Offices of David P. Petersen, P.C. in Houston, Texas, cases are accepted on both types of arrangements. 




What will the attorney do for me?By hiring an attorney to represent your legal rights, you receive more than just simply representation of your case. At The Law Offices of David P. Petersen, P.C., we have learned that our clients receive satisfaction simply being able to lateral off the unknown aspects of their claim. Lack of knowledge and understanding causes uncertainly, anxiety and fear. By having a competent attorney handle your case, you are able to spend your time as you please without the constant stress of dealing with the insurance companies antics or trying to figure out what to do before your next deadline.




How long will my case take to finish?A civil case requiring litigation take approximately 2-3 years to complete while non-litigation cases are usually resolved within 1-2 years. There is no precise formula to determine with any certainty the amount of time a case will take as there are many factors outside the attorney’s control. Some cases take longer than other similar cases simply due to matters beyond the attorney’s control such as the court’s trial docket, potential for appeals or by actions of the opposing parties. Although the amount of time necessary to properly and thoroughly resolve a particular civil matter does not lend itself to a precise formula, based upon experience we can provide some parameters.Many cases are resolved without any necessity of filing a lawsuit. In such cases, clients can expect their cases to be resolved in a timely manner, usually within a few months after being released from their medical providers after reaching MMI, maximum medical improvement. It has always been our policy when time allows, to provide the opposing side the opportunity to resolve our client’s losses prior to filing a lawsuit. In the event the opposing interests are not willing to negotiate in good faith or attempt to reach a fair and impartial settlement prior to a lawsuit being filed, your only remedy is by filing your complaint with the court having jurisdiction over your case. In those cases which require litigation, there are several factors which effect the final resolution of a case, including the level of discovery, number of parties, court’s trial docket, however, most cases are usually resolved within 2 years from the date of original filing.

I interviewed at Peterson David M PC.InterviewApplied for legal assistant position, came at the scheduled time and no one was in the office. After about half an hour, finally an accountant came down to "interview." It was barely an interview, he just asked if I could start the next day. There was no information regarding the firm, nor further explanation on the scope of job responsibility. The whole process does not leave room for you to think over whether it is a good fit for you, but a lot like they just want to get the interview over with. When confronted with specific questions about the firm, the interviewer carried such an unprofessionally dismissive attitude that immediately put the firm into a shady light. Well in the end it turned out to be an absolutely correct assumption. Easily the WORST interview experience in the legal field one could ever have.Interview Questions Can you start the next day   Answer Question Peterson David M PC 2017-07-01 18:38 PDTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Peterson David M PC Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Oct 4, 2016    Peterson David M PC LogoLegal Assistant Interview Anonymous EmployeeAccepted OfferNeutral ExperienceEasy InterviewApplicationI applied online.

MISSION STATEMENT
To explore and present the history of the automobile and its impact on American life and culture using Los Angeles as a prime example.
ABOUT THE MUSEUM
Founded on June 11, 1994 by magazine publisher Robert E. Petersen, and his wife Margie, the Petersen Automotive Museum is owned and operated by the Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation. Previously located within the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the museum is permanently housed in a historic department store originally designed by Welton Becket. The building opened in 1962 as a short-lived U.S. branch of Seibu Department Stores, before operating as an Ohrbach’s department store from 1965 to 1986. Six years after Ohrbach’s closed, Robert Petersen selected the largely windowless site as an ideal space for a museum, where artifacts could be displayed without harmful exposure to the ultraviolet radiation of direct sunlight.
In 2015, the museum underwent an extensive $90 million renovation. The building’s façade was redesigned by the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, while designers at The Scenic Route configured interior spaces to accommodate changing exhibits that are intended to encourage repeated visits. The exterior features a stainless-steel ribbon assembly, made of 100 tons of 14-gauge type 304 steel in 308 sections, 25 supports and 140,000 custom stainless-steel screws. The remodeled museum opened to the public on December 7, 2015.

MUSEUM HISTORY
If there is one thing that we all have in common, especially in Southern California, it’s the automobile. To some the automobile is an appliance, but to us it is a passion. The Petersen Automotive Museum has been celebrating this passion since 1994 on the corner of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, the third most travelled intersection in the city of Los Angeles. It anchors one end of the famed “Miracle Mile” created by real estate developer A.W. Ross in 1936. Created in a time before shopping malls, the Miracle Mile centralized shopping in the area and was “The” place to go for high end shopping. Wilshire was also home to various “firsts” including dedicated left-turn lanes and the first timed traffic lights in the United States. Ross also required merchants to provide automobile parking lots behind their stores, all to aid traffic flow.
The Museum’s unforgettable architecture by world renowned architect, Welton Becket was cutting edge when the building was opened in 1962 as Seibu, a Japanese department store. When Seibu left the United States in 1965, Ohrbach’s moved into the building and it became a popular local shopping spot until its closing in 1986. The building stood vacant for approximately 6 years until inspiration struck the late Robert E. Petersen, who was looking for a consolidated headquarters for Petersen Publishing. Upon further investigation, he decided that the near-windowless structure would not be the best choice for an office building, but it would make an excellent museum. To preserve the Museum’s artifacts inside, they need to keep away from the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays.
Seeing the building’s true potential as an automotive-inspired educational institution, Mr. and Mrs. Petersen put forth a large portion of the money necessary to create the Petersen Automotive Museum. The Museum was to be much more than a large room filled with cars parked in rows like an indoor parking lot. From the beginning, the vehicles chosen for exhibition had to be displayed in context to give them real meaning and a better experience for all who would come to visit. The “Streetscape” was full of architectural elements that were period correct for the vehicles that surrounded them, immersing visitors deep into the stories that were told. The second floor featured rotating exhibit areas and the third floor featured the Discovery Center which taught art and science through the automobile to children of all ages.
The Museum was developed in a mere three years and opened on June 11th, 1994.







KOHN PEDERSON FOX
Because the Petersen Automotive Museum is the western gateway to Museum Row in Los Angeles, its second-generation iteration needed to be a beacon. The Petersen is the first project in a revitalization movement that includes the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum directly across the street, a major overhaul of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) a block to the east, and a new subway station next door.
Architect Gene Kohn saw the project as a signature opportunity for his firm, Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF). Having designed high-profile buildings throughout the world, the KPF thumbprint was on most major urban areas with one notable exception: Los Angeles. Following a tour of the old museum, Gene Kohn began sending sketches to Petersen Vice Chairman David Sydorick. KPF eventually compiled these in a stunning 78-page book with a hand-engraved cover. Instead of providing budget breakdowns and engineering data, the KPF presentation offered ideas about how an existing building could communicate speed and motion. Then KPF took a leap of faith: The architectural firm created a 3-D model of the daring design. A 120-page “proposal” book of sketches and renderings soon followed. The KPF model and book inspired community leader Peter Mullin to return to the Petersen in January 2013 as Chairman of the Board to steer the museum’s re-birth.
 


A 21ST CENTURY TRANSFORMATION
After the project was approved, The Petersen’s board took a field trip to view mock-ups of the metal-ribbon façade at the A. Zahner Company in Kansas City. “As we watched the sun go around, the ribbons glowed,” said museum Vice Chairman David Sydorick. “It really was spectacular.” Only minor refinements were made to KPF lead architect Trent Tesch’s original design. On the eastern side of the building, the ribbons were flattened to stay within the property line. City requirements mandated elevating some of the ribbons on the Fairfax side. Also necessary for compliance, lower ribbons on the Wilshire side were “bubbled” around the main entrance. MATT Construction was the obvious choice for realizing KPF’s vision with Zahner’s architectural steel. The builder specializes in museums. Its portfolio includes LACMA’s Resnick Pavilion, the California Science Center’s Space Shuttle display, the Armand Hammer Museum, The Broad Museum, the Skirball Cultural Center, and the Pacific Asia Museum.







 





 





 





 





 








PETER W. MULLIN
PETER MULLIN’S REPUTATION as someone who makes things happen is well established. He sits on the boards of several organizations and foundations, including Art Center College of Design, the Guggenheim Foundation, Occidental College, Saint John’s Hospital, and the UCLA Foundation Board of Trustees. Peter is also Chairman of the Music Center Foundation, a current member of the Board of Visitors of the John E. Anderson School of Management at UCLA, Chairman of the Mullin Automotive Museum Foundation, and President of the American Bugatti Club. Like many Petersen directors, he has an extensive background with museums. A deep and abiding love of automobiles makes Peter Mullin the ideal Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Petersen Automotive Museum. In this position he is able to use his civic relationships and experience to help steer the Petersen toward a future as one of the world’s great automotive museums.
Peter and Merle Mullin are generally considered the foremost collectors of prewar Art Deco French cars: Bugattis, Delahayes, Delages, Talbot-Lagos, Voisins, Hispano-Suizas, Peugeots, and Citroëns, among others. “For me, the French automobiles of the 1920s and 1930s represent the pinnacle of 20th-century art and design,” he says. The Mullin Collection
also has a number of brass-era Art Nouveau French cars. The collection’s “Mona Lisa” is a 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, Jean Bugatti’s masterpiece. Other stunning cars that are often on display at the Mullin Automotive Museum when they aren’t at the Petersen include the “tear drop” 1937 Talbot-Lago Type 150-C-S (“Goutte d’Eau”) and “The Million Franc” 1937 Delahaye Type 145 V12 Grand Prix, driven by René Dreyfus and still arguably France’s most storied racecar. One of the Mullins’ most colorful cars is the “Lady of the Lake,” a 1925 Bugatti Brescia Type 22 Roadster. Formerly owned by the great racer/restauranteur René Dreyfus, the car was “disposed of” in 1937 by Swiss customs agents for non-payment of duties tax. Intending to retrieve the car later, the agents lowered the Bugatti into Lake Maggiore, attached to chains. However, when the chains subsequently broke, the Bugatti sank to a depth of 173 feet. Divers could not exhume the car until 2009, and Peter Mullin bought it at auction in 2010. The preserved car remains in as-recovered condition. He also has an impressive collection of automotive hood mascots made by French glass master René Lalique.
Peter Mullin is committed to functional aesthetics: how aerodynamics shape a raindrop, how surface tension forms a teardrop. A manifestation of this is his major donation to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, the institution’s largest individual gift ever. Automobile magazine named Peter Mullin its 2015 Man of the Year based in part on this gift. Professionally, he is co-founder and Chairman of the Board of M Financial Holdings Incorporated (M Financial), a national reinsurance company and network of independent firms that serve the financial and life insurance needs of Fortune 500 corporations, executives, and affluent individuals. He is also Chairman of Mullin | Barens | Sanford Financial, an independent executive benefits and solutions provider and a member of M Financial Group. Peter has consulted on executive compensation and benefits issues for more than 40 years for public and privately held firms across a variety of industries. Sustainability and environmental stewardship is another area where Peter leads. His buildings are solar-powered and feed excess energy into the grid. Peter is also pioneering biological waste-water treatment technologies and hydroponic gardening. Never content with business as usual, Peter Mullin is the ideal person to lead the Petersen’s transition from a static museum to a futuristic automotive entertainment experience.
DAVID SYDORICK
David Sydorick has built a reputation as one of the world’s greatest enthusiasts for the works of Carrozzeria Zagato. His knowledge and love for the Milanese coachbuilder is well-documented. What is less well-documented is his longtime commitment to the Petersen Automotive Museum. David Sydorick is the only board member to serve continuously from the museum’s opening in 1994 to the present. During his time on the board, David has served in several positions, including Secretary and Vice Chairman. He was also one of the first ten members of the Checkered Flag 200 group, headed by fellow board member Bruce Meyer. These original Checkered Flag members were instrumental in launching the museum in 1994. One of David’s greatest contributions to the Petersen Automotive Museum has been his zeal for the grand redesign of the building at 6060 Wilshire Blvd. He reached out to several architects, from downtown Los Angeles to Europe, for proposals. Ideas ranged from razing the building to making it a multi-purpose museum/high-rise residential complex. Car-enthusiast architect A. Eugene “Gene” Kohn, Chairman of New York-based Kohn Pedersen Fox, was a longtime acquaintance of David. During one of Gene’s visits to Los Angeles, David proposed the idea of doing a wrap on the original Welton Becket-designed structure. This would bring the museum into the 21st century more cost-effectively than knocking the building down and starting over from scratch. David suggested using colors and materials that would speak to automotive enthusiasts. This idea is now evident in the museum’s use of “hot rod” red and brushed steel, assembled with rivet-like fasteners. The overall effect evokes both the feel of early 20th century rivet-bodied coachbuilt cars and stripped-down hot rods and racecars from the 1950s or 1960s. David’s vision has been instrumental in the success of the Petersen’s new aesthetic, but he also has labored tirelessly to attract some of the most capable, influential, and enthusiastic figures in Los Angeles to the Petersen’s Board of Directors. Perhaps most notably, Bruce Meyer and David convinced renowned car-collector, museum visionary, and philanthropist Peter W. Mullin to return to the Petersen after a long hiatus to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors.


To say that David has been absolutely crucial to the continued success of the Petersen Automotive Museum would be a gross understatement. His generosity, love of automobiles, drive, and determination have been critical to the organization since its inception. A retired Wall Street investment banker, David and his wife, Ginny, have participated in automotive events around the world. Highlights include a 1998 drive across China with Louis Vuitton and competing in seven Mille Miglias (including one with Phil Hill). The Petersen Automotive Museum’s collection has benefitted from David’s philanthropy. He has donated many significant cars to the museum over the years, including Boyd Coddington’s famous Aluma Coupe.
BRUCE MEYER
BRUCE MEYER HAS BEEN CALLED “THE CAR GUY’S CAR GUY.” Given his dedication to the hobby and his desire to share and promote it tirelessly, this appellation seems perfectly accurate. The Petersen is fortunate to have such an enthusiastic supporter, one who has honorably served as the “face” of museum for much of its existence. Bruce Meyer is known throughout automotive circles for having one of the most discriminating vehicle collections anywhere. He tends to cherry-pick the very best example of each car he likes; many have storied owners and race-winning provenances. Although his cars are museum-quality, Bruce has driven them all and frequently takes them on rallies, tracks, and to car shows. Bruce’s automotive enthusiasm is infectious and a pillar of the Petersen Automotive Museum. A noted civic leader in Los Angeles, Bruce has been involved with many nonprofits, including the California Highway Patrol 11-99 Foundation and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, which has a small collection of vehicles among its various other historical artifacts. As a car guy, Bruce saw the value of having a dedicated automotive museum in Los Angeles, the spiritual home of American car culture.


Bruce was also close friends with the Petersens. He knew that Robert E. Petersen had the perfect combination of attributes to help Los Angeles County launch a stand-alone automotive museum: prior experience at his Motorama Museum, Los Angeles real estate, a burgeoning car collection, and a flourishing legacy. Conceived as a partnership between the Petersens and Los Angeles County, the Petersen Automotive Museum opened in 1994 with Bruce Meyer as its Founding Chairman. Bruce also launched the Checkered Flag 200, the museum’s premium membership level, and continues to serve as its Chairman. A Beverly Hills-based real estate investor and president of Meyer Pacific, he has been the recipient of multiple prestigious awards. These include the Meguiar’s Award for the Car Hobby’s Person of the Year, the Automotive Icon Award from the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Lee Iacocca Award, and the City of Hope Car Collector of the Year.
He also serves on the board of the Nethercutt Collection, the Mullin Automotive Museum, and the LeMay Museum. Bruce’s cachet among the automotive cognoscenti comes from his boundless enthusiasm for the automobile not only as art, something to be appreciated statically, but his willingness to drive some of the world’s best cars on the street. Bruce has cultivated this undeniable charm over the years as his collection has grown. One of the more spectacular examples involved Bruce driving his Le Mans-winning Porsche Kremer 935 across town to a car event. This roaring monster makes no pretense of being a street car. And nobody consistently makes a grander entrance than Bruce Meyer. Bruce’s focus sets him apart from other collectors. Not content to own “one of,” he searches for “the” car. For example, Bruce doesn’t just have an original Shelby Cobra, he has the first production one ever built. Porsche made dozens of 935s, but Bruce owns the only one to ever win Le Mans outright. This approach has allowed Bruce to build arguably one of the finest private collections in the world, one that he generously shares with car lovers: The Petersen has had a Bruce Meyer Gallery since its inception. Cars from Bruce’s personal collection and incredible ones on loan from others consistently make the Meyer Gallery one of the museum’s top attractions.
RICHARD VARNER
Richard Varner, a native of Wichita, Kansas, graduated from the University of Nebraska. He received his MBA from the University of Kansas in 1978. Richard’s early career included positions in crude oil logistics, trading, and refining in U.S. and Europe with the Coastal Corporation, Questor Petroleum, and Mitsui & Co. USA. In 1991 he formed Newport Petroleum, building a fleet of ocean-going petroleum barges and tugs. Since the sale of Newport Petroleum in 2003, Richard has actively been involved in the acquisition of LDC and pipeline assets in the natural gas industry through Navitas Utilities and Warrior Petroleum. His passion for collecting and restoring automobiles and motorcycles turned an avocation into a business building complete motorcycles and producing performance parts, and now extends to an ownership in the professional motorcycle road-racing series MotoAmerica. Richard also serves on the board of the CHP 11-99 Foundation.
He is a Trustee of the University of Nebraska Foundation and serves on the advisory board of the University of Nebraska School of Business. Richard is a member and former Chairman of the Southern California Chapter of the World Presidents Organization and Young Presidents Organization. He has three children and two grandchildren.

Charlie also drove the late Walter Payton’s Indy car in the 1997 CART/FedEx Championship. In recent years, he has focused on setting records at the Bonneville Salt Flats with the “Spirit of Rett” streamliner. In September 2010, Charlie set a 414-MPH FIA record, breaking the 45-year-old record of the Summers Brothers’ “Goldenrod,” and making the “Spirit of Rett” the fastest normally aspirated car in history, as well as the 3rd fastest internal combustion engine car in history. A graduate of Dartmouth College, Charlie received AB, BE, and ME degrees at Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, where he has been an Overseer for 24 years. He is also a Trustee of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Foundation, the Maryland Institute College of Art, the Art Center College of Design, and he is a Life Trustee of the St. Mark’s School of Texas.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. David Petersen has the following 1 area of expertise and  1 specialty.                     General Practice
