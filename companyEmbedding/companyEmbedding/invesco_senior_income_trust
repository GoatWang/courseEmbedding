Invesco Senior Income Trust (NYSE:VVR) to Issue $0.02 Monthly Dividend
Paterniano Del Favero
Luglio 18, 2017



Condividere













A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. When the price is below the Balance Step, this generally spells a bearish trend.For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator.Pioneer Municipal High (NYSE MAV) traded down 0.34% during trading on Monday, reaching $11.56. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI can help show whether the bulls or the bears are now strongest in the market. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Invesco Senior Income Trust has a one year low of $4.21 and a one year high of $4.77. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. Currently, the 14-day ADX is 10.73. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. Invesco Van Kampen High Income Trust II (VLT) now has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -5.03. Blackrock International Growth and Income Trust (BGY)'s Williams %R presently stands at -13.33. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. The firm's 50-day moving average is $14.86 and its 200-day moving average is $14.70. Crunching the numbers and doing full analysis of stocks that have been trending down may help lead to some discoveries that could turn out to be highly valuable if and when the momentum shifts to the upside. CCI may also be used to help discover divergences that could possibly signal reversal moves. The Balance Step formula is based on near-term moving averages to predict which direction a trend is heading. A certain stock may be considered to be on an uptrend if trading above a moving average and the average is sloping upward.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.
