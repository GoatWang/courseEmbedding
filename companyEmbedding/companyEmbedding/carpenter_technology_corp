History[edit]
The company was founded by James Henry Carpenter and a small group of New York City investors on June 1, 1889 as the Carpenter Steel Company.[2] He envisioned methods to improve the process of steel manufacturing.[2]
In May 1890, the company received a contract from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to develop armor-piercing projectiles.[2] James Carpenter had received a patent for an "air-hardening steel" manufacturing process.[2] In November 1896, the Navy referred to the company's projectiles as "the first made that would pierce improved armor plate."[2] In the Spanish–American War of 1898, the routing of the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay was credited in part to projectiles made by Carpenter.[2]
The burgeoning automobile industry of the early 20th century led to several advancements at the company. In 1905, the company developed a prime grade chrome-nickel steel and by 1908 it had created ten other steels that were used to make automobile chassis.[2] Most of the "runabout" vehicles of the day ran on Carpenter steel, and "Old 16," the race car that won the Vanderbilt Cup in 1908, comprised front and rear axles, crankshaft, gears, and other parts fabricated from Carpenter steel.[2]
In 1903, Carpenter's "special" steels were used in the engine of the Wright brothers' maiden flight.[2]
After the United States entered World War I, munitions and supplies became the company's top product.[2] The Reading plant operated on 24-hour shifts, producing everything from tool steels to soldiers' safety razor blades.[2] During the war, the company put into operation 4 new electric-arc furnaces, which allowed greater control over the melting process than the old crucible furnaces. In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.[2]
In December 1920, Carpenter unveiled its "rustless steel," an alloy of 0.3% carbon, 20% chromium, and 1% copper.[2] In 1927, Carpenter's Welded Alloy Tube Division became the earliest commercial supplier of stainless tubing, with applications in chemical processing, oil refining, generation of electricity, and food and beverage processing.[2] In 1928, it introduced the first free-machining, "antifriction" stainless steel, due to use of sulfur.[2] In 1929, the company produced 24 pounds of automotive trim on each Pierce Arrow car.[2]
The gears, shafts, and fasteners of the engine of the "Spirit of St. Louis," Charles Lindbergh's legendary plane that flew across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, were all made from Carpenter steel.[2] An identical engine had powered Richard Byrd's flight to the North Pole in 1926.[2]
Although the company operated at a loss during the Great Depression, the company introduced new stainless steels with additives of selenium, tellurium, and chrome and nickel and began licensing other manufacturers to produce some of its stainless steels.[2]
In June 1937, Carpenter Steel Company went public.[2]
In March 1941, with U.S. entrance into World War II looking increasingly probable, the U.S. Office of Production Management summoned Carpenter's president to Washington, D.C., to discuss expanding the company's production capacity on an urgent basis.[2] Carpenter's board of directors voted to immediately implement a capital investment program of nearly $1 million.[2] During the war, the company's stainless steel was used in engine parts, steel fasteners, and cockpit instruments for fighter planes and bombers; components of Sherman tanks and submarines; radio masts for PT boats and radio equipment for battle fronts; and medical supplies such as hypodermic needles and surgical implements.[2]
During the 1950s, Carpenter introduced "Stainless 20," an alloy which by virtue of rare earth element additives could withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals.[2] In 1951, Carpenter bought a wire redrawing plant in New Jersey, which produced fine wire for applications such as surgical sutures and knitting machines.[2] In 1954, the company added a new mill in Reading which allowed Carpenter to become extremely competitive in the manufacture of specialty alloy wire.[2] After the company had to turn down orders due to not having enough capacity, Carpenter acquired Northeastern Steel Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enabling a 100 percent increase in the production of ingots.[2]
The company made the following acquisitions in the 1960s: NTH Products, Inc., of El Cajon, California, in 1961; a 50 percent share in Gardner Cryogenics Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1969; and a 50 percent share in Titanium Technology Corporation, Pomona, California, also in 1969.[2] In 1967, the company opened a new research and development center.[2] In 1968, the company changed its name to Carpenter Technology Corporation to reflect its research and development initiatives.[2]
In the 1970s, Carpenter sold the New Jersey wire redrawing plant, Titanium Technology Corporation, Gardner Cryogenics, and affiliates in Brazil and Mexico.[2] According to Howard O. Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Henry Carpenter and a small group of New York City investors on June 1, 1889 as the Carpenter Steel Company.[2] He envisioned methods to improve the process of steel manufacturing.[2]
In May 1890, the company received a contract from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to develop armor-piercing projectiles.[2] James Carpenter had received a patent for an "air-hardening steel" manufacturing process.[2] In November 1896, the Navy referred to the company's projectiles as "the first made that would pierce improved armor plate."[2] In the Spanish–American War of 1898, the routing of the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay was credited in part to projectiles made by Carpenter.[2]
The burgeoning automobile industry of the early 20th century led to several advancements at the company. In 1905, the company developed a prime grade chrome-nickel steel and by 1908 it had created ten other steels that were used to make automobile chassis.[2] Most of the "runabout" vehicles of the day ran on Carpenter steel, and "Old 16," the race car that won the Vanderbilt Cup in 1908, comprised front and rear axles, crankshaft, gears, and other parts fabricated from Carpenter steel.[2]
In 1903, Carpenter's "special" steels were used in the engine of the Wright brothers' maiden flight.[2]
After the United States entered World War I, munitions and supplies became the company's top product.[2] The Reading plant operated on 24-hour shifts, producing everything from tool steels to soldiers' safety razor blades.[2] During the war, the company put into operation 4 new electric-arc furnaces, which allowed greater control over the melting process than the old crucible furnaces. In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.[2]
In December 1920, Carpenter unveiled its "rustless steel," an alloy of 0.3% carbon, 20% chromium, and 1% copper.[2] In 1927, Carpenter's Welded Alloy Tube Division became the earliest commercial supplier of stainless tubing, with applications in chemical processing, oil refining, generation of electricity, and food and beverage processing.[2] In 1928, it introduced the first free-machining, "antifriction" stainless steel, due to use of sulfur.[2] In 1929, the company produced 24 pounds of automotive trim on each Pierce Arrow car.[2]
The gears, shafts, and fasteners of the engine of the "Spirit of St. Louis," Charles Lindbergh's legendary plane that flew across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, were all made from Carpenter steel.[2] An identical engine had powered Richard Byrd's flight to the North Pole in 1926.[2]
Although the company operated at a loss during the Great Depression, the company introduced new stainless steels with additives of selenium, tellurium, and chrome and nickel and began licensing other manufacturers to produce some of its stainless steels.[2]
In June 1937, Carpenter Steel Company went public.[2]
In March 1941, with U.S. entrance into World War II looking increasingly probable, the U.S. Office of Production Management summoned Carpenter's president to Washington, D.C., to discuss expanding the company's production capacity on an urgent basis.[2] Carpenter's board of directors voted to immediately implement a capital investment program of nearly $1 million.[2] During the war, the company's stainless steel was used in engine parts, steel fasteners, and cockpit instruments for fighter planes and bombers; components of Sherman tanks and submarines; radio masts for PT boats and radio equipment for battle fronts; and medical supplies such as hypodermic needles and surgical implements.[2]
During the 1950s, Carpenter introduced "Stainless 20," an alloy which by virtue of rare earth element additives could withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals.[2] In 1951, Carpenter bought a wire redrawing plant in New Jersey, which produced fine wire for applications such as surgical sutures and knitting machines.[2] In 1954, the company added a new mill in Reading which allowed Carpenter to become extremely competitive in the manufacture of specialty alloy wire.[2] After the company had to turn down orders due to not having enough capacity, Carpenter acquired Northeastern Steel Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enabling a 100 percent increase in the production of ingots.[2]
The company made the following acquisitions in the 1960s: NTH Products, Inc., of El Cajon, California, in 1961; a 50 percent share in Gardner Cryogenics Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1969; and a 50 percent share in Titanium Technology Corporation, Pomona, California, also in 1969.[2] In 1967, the company opened a new research and development center.[2] In 1968, the company changed its name to Carpenter Technology Corporation to reflect its research and development initiatives.[2]
In the 1970s, Carpenter sold the New Jersey wire redrawing plant, Titanium Technology Corporation, Gardner Cryogenics, and affiliates in Brazil and Mexico.[2] According to Howard O. Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Henry Carpenter and a small group of New York City investors on June 1, 1889 as the Carpenter Steel Company.[2] He envisioned methods to improve the process of steel manufacturing.[2]
In May 1890, the company received a contract from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to develop armor-piercing projectiles.[2] James Carpenter had received a patent for an "air-hardening steel" manufacturing process.[2] In November 1896, the Navy referred to the company's projectiles as "the first made that would pierce improved armor plate."[2] In the Spanish–American War of 1898, the routing of the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay was credited in part to projectiles made by Carpenter.[2]
The burgeoning automobile industry of the early 20th century led to several advancements at the company. In 1905, the company developed a prime grade chrome-nickel steel and by 1908 it had created ten other steels that were used to make automobile chassis.[2] Most of the "runabout" vehicles of the day ran on Carpenter steel, and "Old 16," the race car that won the Vanderbilt Cup in 1908, comprised front and rear axles, crankshaft, gears, and other parts fabricated from Carpenter steel.[2]
In 1903, Carpenter's "special" steels were used in the engine of the Wright brothers' maiden flight.[2]
After the United States entered World War I, munitions and supplies became the company's top product.[2] The Reading plant operated on 24-hour shifts, producing everything from tool steels to soldiers' safety razor blades.[2] During the war, the company put into operation 4 new electric-arc furnaces, which allowed greater control over the melting process than the old crucible furnaces. In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.[2]
In December 1920, Carpenter unveiled its "rustless steel," an alloy of 0.3% carbon, 20% chromium, and 1% copper.[2] In 1927, Carpenter's Welded Alloy Tube Division became the earliest commercial supplier of stainless tubing, with applications in chemical processing, oil refining, generation of electricity, and food and beverage processing.[2] In 1928, it introduced the first free-machining, "antifriction" stainless steel, due to use of sulfur.[2] In 1929, the company produced 24 pounds of automotive trim on each Pierce Arrow car.[2]
The gears, shafts, and fasteners of the engine of the "Spirit of St. Louis," Charles Lindbergh's legendary plane that flew across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, were all made from Carpenter steel.[2] An identical engine had powered Richard Byrd's flight to the North Pole in 1926.[2]
Although the company operated at a loss during the Great Depression, the company introduced new stainless steels with additives of selenium, tellurium, and chrome and nickel and began licensing other manufacturers to produce some of its stainless steels.[2]
In June 1937, Carpenter Steel Company went public.[2]
In March 1941, with U.S. entrance into World War II looking increasingly probable, the U.S. Office of Production Management summoned Carpenter's president to Washington, D.C., to discuss expanding the company's production capacity on an urgent basis.[2] Carpenter's board of directors voted to immediately implement a capital investment program of nearly $1 million.[2] During the war, the company's stainless steel was used in engine parts, steel fasteners, and cockpit instruments for fighter planes and bombers; components of Sherman tanks and submarines; radio masts for PT boats and radio equipment for battle fronts; and medical supplies such as hypodermic needles and surgical implements.[2]
During the 1950s, Carpenter introduced "Stainless 20," an alloy which by virtue of rare earth element additives could withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals.[2] In 1951, Carpenter bought a wire redrawing plant in New Jersey, which produced fine wire for applications such as surgical sutures and knitting machines.[2] In 1954, the company added a new mill in Reading which allowed Carpenter to become extremely competitive in the manufacture of specialty alloy wire.[2] After the company had to turn down orders due to not having enough capacity, Carpenter acquired Northeastern Steel Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enabling a 100 percent increase in the production of ingots.[2]
The company made the following acquisitions in the 1960s: NTH Products, Inc., of El Cajon, California, in 1961; a 50 percent share in Gardner Cryogenics Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1969; and a 50 percent share in Titanium Technology Corporation, Pomona, California, also in 1969.[2] In 1967, the company opened a new research and development center.[2] In 1968, the company changed its name to Carpenter Technology Corporation to reflect its research and development initiatives.[2]
In the 1970s, Carpenter sold the New Jersey wire redrawing plant, Titanium Technology Corporation, Gardner Cryogenics, and affiliates in Brazil and Mexico.[2] According to Howard O. Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.[2]
In December 1920, Carpenter unveiled its "rustless steel," an alloy of 0.3% carbon, 20% chromium, and 1% copper.[2] In 1927, Carpenter's Welded Alloy Tube Division became the earliest commercial supplier of stainless tubing, with applications in chemical processing, oil refining, generation of electricity, and food and beverage processing.[2] In 1928, it introduced the first free-machining, "antifriction" stainless steel, due to use of sulfur.[2] In 1929, the company produced 24 pounds of automotive trim on each Pierce Arrow car.[2]
The gears, shafts, and fasteners of the engine of the "Spirit of St. Louis," Charles Lindbergh's legendary plane that flew across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, were all made from Carpenter steel.[2] An identical engine had powered Richard Byrd's flight to the North Pole in 1926.[2]
Although the company operated at a loss during the Great Depression, the company introduced new stainless steels with additives of selenium, tellurium, and chrome and nickel and began licensing other manufacturers to produce some of its stainless steels.[2]
In June 1937, Carpenter Steel Company went public.[2]
In March 1941, with U.S. entrance into World War II looking increasingly probable, the U.S. Office of Production Management summoned Carpenter's president to Washington, D.C., to discuss expanding the company's production capacity on an urgent basis.[2] Carpenter's board of directors voted to immediately implement a capital investment program of nearly $1 million.[2] During the war, the company's stainless steel was used in engine parts, steel fasteners, and cockpit instruments for fighter planes and bombers; components of Sherman tanks and submarines; radio masts for PT boats and radio equipment for battle fronts; and medical supplies such as hypodermic needles and surgical implements.[2]
During the 1950s, Carpenter introduced "Stainless 20," an alloy which by virtue of rare earth element additives could withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals.[2] In 1951, Carpenter bought a wire redrawing plant in New Jersey, which produced fine wire for applications such as surgical sutures and knitting machines.[2] In 1954, the company added a new mill in Reading which allowed Carpenter to become extremely competitive in the manufacture of specialty alloy wire.[2] After the company had to turn down orders due to not having enough capacity, Carpenter acquired Northeastern Steel Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enabling a 100 percent increase in the production of ingots.[2]
The company made the following acquisitions in the 1960s: NTH Products, Inc., of El Cajon, California, in 1961; a 50 percent share in Gardner Cryogenics Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1969; and a 50 percent share in Titanium Technology Corporation, Pomona, California, also in 1969.[2] In 1967, the company opened a new research and development center.[2] In 1968, the company changed its name to Carpenter Technology Corporation to reflect its research and development initiatives.[2]
In the 1970s, Carpenter sold the New Jersey wire redrawing plant, Titanium Technology Corporation, Gardner Cryogenics, and affiliates in Brazil and Mexico.[2] According to Howard O. Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

Carpenter Technology Begins Production of Industry’s  First High-Strength, Low-Oxygen Titanium Powder




















June 20, 2017 01:00 ET

 | Source: Carpenter Technology Corp.






PARIS, June  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carpenter Technology Corporation (NYSE:CRS) announced today the production of CARTECH® PURIS 5+™, the market’s first high-strength, low-oxygen titanium powder solution. A custom composition of Ti-6AI-4V that meets all Grade 5 specifications, CARTECH PURIS 5+ signals a breakthrough in additive manufacturers’ ability to better control oxygen content inherent to their processes without compromising powder strength. “Balancing oxygen levels with desired strength properties is a challenge in additive manufacturing.  CARTECH PURIS 5+ provides the simultaneous optimization of powder recyclability and strength, alleviating concerns about using low oxygen powder (to maximize powder reuse) while still exceeding standard strength requirements,” explained Michael Murtagh, Carpenter’s Chief Technology Officer. “CARTECH PURIS 5+ makes this balance easier, more efficient, and more effective from the start and throughout the titanium powder lifecycle.” CARTECH PURIS 5+ is Carpenter Technology’s first major powder product introduction since its acquisition of Puris, LLC earlier this year. Carpenter experts in powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing will be available at the International Paris Air Show Le Bourget 2017, held Monday, June 19 through Sunday, June 25, Hall 5, Stand E232. “The future of aerospace hinges on advancing additive manufacturing technology,” added Tony R. Thene, Carpenter’s Chief Executive Officer. “It’s an exciting, yet complex process with enormous potential, and it requires extensive metallurgical expertise, in addition to quality powder products. Carpenter Technology is well-positioned to provide these value-added solutions to customers.”           About Carpenter Technology Carpenter Technology Corporation is a leading producer and distributor of premium specialty alloys, including titanium alloys, nickel and cobalt based superalloys, stainless steels, alloy steels and tool steels.  Carpenter’s high-performance materials and advanced process solutions are an integral part of critical applications used within the aerospace, transportation, medical and energy markets, among other markets.  Building on its history of innovation, Carpenter’s powder technology capabilities support a range of next-generation products and manufacturing techniques, including additive manufacturing or 3D Printing.  Information about Carpenter can be found at www.cartech.com.

TANNER, Alabama – Carpenter Technology Corporation
hosted a ribbon cutting this afternoon at its new $518 million premium metals
plant that will eventually employ up to 200 workers in rural Limestone County.
The 500,000-square-foot facility, located on
230 acres on Thomas Hammons Road in Tanner, will manufacture
alloy steel products for the aerospace, medical and energy markets. At full
capacity, the plant will produce roughly 27,000 tons of ultra-premium alloy
materials each year for critical energy applications, aerospace engines and
medical devices. 
Carpenter President and Chief Executive
Officer Bill Wulfsohn said it took 2,750 truckloads of concrete to form the building and its foundation. The plant's hydraulic press – the
centerpiece of the facility and the largest of its kind in the world – weighs the
equivalent of 17 space shuttles or 137 Boeing 787 planes, Wulfsohn said.
The massive plant, which will be
responsible for remelting, forging, finishing and testing steel alloys, was
also on budget and a few weeks ahead of schedule, Wulfsohn said.
"When you think of a facility of this
type and magnitude, that's not a common event," he said. 
The ribbon cutting event came less than
a week after officials announced that Chicago-based Alliance Steel LLC will invest
nearly $5.4 million in the former Delphi Building 22 near Carpenter's new
plant. After Nexus AG Holdings purchases the land and property, the steel coil
processor will create 45 new jobs at the site within three years.
Gov. Robert Bentley, Carpenter
officials, plant employees, and leaders from Limestone and Morgan counties
attended the Carpenter grand opening, which also included a live demonstration
of the multi-million dollar radial press, which shapes materials using four hammers
at a temperature hotter than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Built in
response to strong customer demand for premium alloy products in the aerospace
and energy industries, the Carpenter
plant, also known as Athens Operations, currently has 150 workers. 
With the addition of a new $20 million
superalloy powder facility across the street, company spokesman
William Rudolph, Jr., said Carpenter will employ about 250 workers in Tanner by
2017.
Bernie Mara, vice president of global
advanced engineering for Carpenter, said the state of Alabama and city and county governments offered tax incentives of $95 million over 20 years to attract the
Pennsylvania-based company.
"I led the team on the initial site
selection process, so I've been on the project since its inception," he said. "It
really feels great to be standing here in the building competed the way we
envisioned."
Founded 125 years ago, Carpenter Technology maintains operations throughout
the world. The company develops, manufactures and distributes cast/wrought and
powder metal stainless steels and specialty alloys. 
"Carpenter is an old company, but it's a
great company producing very high-quality products that are used in so many
different industries," Bentley said. "Industries that are now fitting into what
we do here in Alabama: aerospace, automotive, medical."

Carpenter Technology Corporation (NYSE:CRS) is a leading international manufacturer and distributor of specialty alloys, powder alloys, titanium, and ceramic materials serving the automotive, aerospace, energy, industrial, medical, defense, and consumer products industries. 
Carpenter’s materials have been used in hundreds of applications – from industrial tools to jet engines to fuel injectors and medical implants. Carpenter produces materials in long product form, including bar, wire, strip, plate, fine wire and billet. 
Since the 1990s, Carpenter has expanded its product line and geographic reach and emerged stronger through economic downturns. Much of this expansion has been customer-driven. Unlike most companies in the steel industry, Carpenter not only manufactures its products but also distributes them through its own worldwide system of service centers. This network, with its staff of metallurgists and engineers on the front lines, enables the company to work closely with its specialty alloys customers to find solutions for their product requirements, as well as to learn first hand which materials need to be upgraded, acquired or created. Carpenter’s direct contact with its customers has given the company a unique marketing edge.

Your personalized new promotional products will do more than offer people an item that they can use constantly; they will promote your business and remind people that you are just a phone call away.

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition. 

We always offer high quality and low prices on customized new promotional products. For your advertising needs, choose National Pen.

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Henry Carpenter and a small group of New York City investors on June 1, 1889 as the Carpenter Steel Company.[2] He envisioned methods to improve the process of steel manufacturing.[2]
In May 1890, the company received a contract from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to develop armor-piercing projectiles.[2] James Carpenter had received a patent for an "air-hardening steel" manufacturing process.[2] In November 1896, the Navy referred to the company's projectiles as "the first made that would pierce improved armor plate."[2] In the Spanish–American War of 1898, the routing of the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay was credited in part to projectiles made by Carpenter.[2]
The burgeoning automobile industry of the early 20th century led to several advancements at the company. In 1905, the company developed a prime grade chrome-nickel steel and by 1908 it had created ten other steels that were used to make automobile chassis.[2] Most of the "runabout" vehicles of the day ran on Carpenter steel, and "Old 16," the race car that won the Vanderbilt Cup in 1908, comprised front and rear axles, crankshaft, gears, and other parts fabricated from Carpenter steel.[2]
In 1903, Carpenter's "special" steels were used in the engine of the Wright brothers' maiden flight.[2]
After the United States entered World War I, munitions and supplies became the company's top product.[2] The Reading plant operated on 24-hour shifts, producing everything from tool steels to soldiers' safety razor blades.[2] During the war, the company put into operation 4 new electric-arc furnaces, which allowed greater control over the melting process than the old crucible furnaces. In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.[2]
In December 1920, Carpenter unveiled its "rustless steel," an alloy of 0.3% carbon, 20% chromium, and 1% copper.[2] In 1927, Carpenter's Welded Alloy Tube Division became the earliest commercial supplier of stainless tubing, with applications in chemical processing, oil refining, generation of electricity, and food and beverage processing.[2] In 1928, it introduced the first free-machining, "antifriction" stainless steel, due to use of sulfur.[2] In 1929, the company produced 24 pounds of automotive trim on each Pierce Arrow car.[2]
The gears, shafts, and fasteners of the engine of the "Spirit of St. Louis," Charles Lindbergh's legendary plane that flew across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, were all made from Carpenter steel.[2] An identical engine had powered Richard Byrd's flight to the North Pole in 1926.[2]
Although the company operated at a loss during the Great Depression, the company introduced new stainless steels with additives of selenium, tellurium, and chrome and nickel and began licensing other manufacturers to produce some of its stainless steels.[2]
In June 1937, Carpenter Steel Company went public.[2]
In March 1941, with U.S. entrance into World War II looking increasingly probable, the U.S. Office of Production Management summoned Carpenter's president to Washington, D.C., to discuss expanding the company's production capacity on an urgent basis.[2] Carpenter's board of directors voted to immediately implement a capital investment program of nearly $1 million.[2] During the war, the company's stainless steel was used in engine parts, steel fasteners, and cockpit instruments for fighter planes and bombers; components of Sherman tanks and submarines; radio masts for PT boats and radio equipment for battle fronts; and medical supplies such as hypodermic needles and surgical implements.[2]
During the 1950s, Carpenter introduced "Stainless 20," an alloy which by virtue of rare earth element additives could withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals.[2] In 1951, Carpenter bought a wire redrawing plant in New Jersey, which produced fine wire for applications such as surgical sutures and knitting machines.[2] In 1954, the company added a new mill in Reading which allowed Carpenter to become extremely competitive in the manufacture of specialty alloy wire.[2] After the company had to turn down orders due to not having enough capacity, Carpenter acquired Northeastern Steel Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enabling a 100 percent increase in the production of ingots.[2]
The company made the following acquisitions in the 1960s: NTH Products, Inc., of El Cajon, California, in 1961; a 50 percent share in Gardner Cryogenics Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1969; and a 50 percent share in Titanium Technology Corporation, Pomona, California, also in 1969.[2] In 1967, the company opened a new research and development center.[2] In 1968, the company changed its name to Carpenter Technology Corporation to reflect its research and development initiatives.[2]
In the 1970s, Carpenter sold the New Jersey wire redrawing plant, Titanium Technology Corporation, Gardner Cryogenics, and affiliates in Brazil and Mexico.[2] According to Howard O. Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

In May 1890, the company received a contract from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to develop armor-piercing projectiles.[2] James Carpenter had received a patent for an "air-hardening steel" manufacturing process.[2] In November 1896, the Navy referred to the company's projectiles as "the first made that would pierce improved armor plate."[2] In the Spanish–American War of 1898, the routing of the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay was credited in part to projectiles made by Carpenter.[2]
The burgeoning automobile industry of the early 20th century led to several advancements at the company. In 1905, the company developed a prime grade chrome-nickel steel and by 1908 it had created ten other steels that were used to make automobile chassis.[2] Most of the "runabout" vehicles of the day ran on Carpenter steel, and "Old 16," the race car that won the Vanderbilt Cup in 1908, comprised front and rear axles, crankshaft, gears, and other parts fabricated from Carpenter steel.[2]
In 1903, Carpenter's "special" steels were used in the engine of the Wright brothers' maiden flight.[2]
After the United States entered World War I, munitions and supplies became the company's top product.[2] The Reading plant operated on 24-hour shifts, producing everything from tool steels to soldiers' safety razor blades.[2] During the war, the company put into operation 4 new electric-arc furnaces, which allowed greater control over the melting process than the old crucible furnaces. In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.[2]
In December 1920, Carpenter unveiled its "rustless steel," an alloy of 0.3% carbon, 20% chromium, and 1% copper.[2] In 1927, Carpenter's Welded Alloy Tube Division became the earliest commercial supplier of stainless tubing, with applications in chemical processing, oil refining, generation of electricity, and food and beverage processing.[2] In 1928, it introduced the first free-machining, "antifriction" stainless steel, due to use of sulfur.[2] In 1929, the company produced 24 pounds of automotive trim on each Pierce Arrow car.[2]
The gears, shafts, and fasteners of the engine of the "Spirit of St. Louis," Charles Lindbergh's legendary plane that flew across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, were all made from Carpenter steel.[2] An identical engine had powered Richard Byrd's flight to the North Pole in 1926.[2]
Although the company operated at a loss during the Great Depression, the company introduced new stainless steels with additives of selenium, tellurium, and chrome and nickel and began licensing other manufacturers to produce some of its stainless steels.[2]
In June 1937, Carpenter Steel Company went public.[2]
In March 1941, with U.S. entrance into World War II looking increasingly probable, the U.S. Office of Production Management summoned Carpenter's president to Washington, D.C., to discuss expanding the company's production capacity on an urgent basis.[2] Carpenter's board of directors voted to immediately implement a capital investment program of nearly $1 million.[2] During the war, the company's stainless steel was used in engine parts, steel fasteners, and cockpit instruments for fighter planes and bombers; components of Sherman tanks and submarines; radio masts for PT boats and radio equipment for battle fronts; and medical supplies such as hypodermic needles and surgical implements.[2]
During the 1950s, Carpenter introduced "Stainless 20," an alloy which by virtue of rare earth element additives could withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals.[2] In 1951, Carpenter bought a wire redrawing plant in New Jersey, which produced fine wire for applications such as surgical sutures and knitting machines.[2] In 1954, the company added a new mill in Reading which allowed Carpenter to become extremely competitive in the manufacture of specialty alloy wire.[2] After the company had to turn down orders due to not having enough capacity, Carpenter acquired Northeastern Steel Corporation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enabling a 100 percent increase in the production of ingots.[2]
The company made the following acquisitions in the 1960s: NTH Products, Inc., of El Cajon, California, in 1961; a 50 percent share in Gardner Cryogenics Corporation, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1969; and a 50 percent share in Titanium Technology Corporation, Pomona, California, also in 1969.[2] In 1967, the company opened a new research and development center.[2] In 1968, the company changed its name to Carpenter Technology Corporation to reflect its research and development initiatives.[2]
In the 1970s, Carpenter sold the New Jersey wire redrawing plant, Titanium Technology Corporation, Gardner Cryogenics, and affiliates in Brazil and Mexico.[2] According to Howard O. Beaver, Jr., who was then president, the divested enterprises "did not fit Carpenter's long-range goals and objectives".[2]
In the 1980s, Carpenter acquired Eagle Precision Metals Corporation of Fryeburg, Maine, a precision drilling facility that produced high quality hollow steel bars, and AMAX Specialty Metals Corporation of Orangeburg, South Carolina, a wire-finishing plant, capable of redrawing steel wire to extremely fine sizes.[2]
Carpenter received a patent in 1992 for super-strong Aermet alloy, first used for the landing gear on aircraft carrier-based jet fighters. AerMet 100 was named one of the top material advances of the decade by the National Association for Science, Technology and Society.
In 1993, Carpenter developed the Carpenter CTS family of 14 alloys to assist knife blade designers in alloy selection.[3]
In 1997, Carpenter acquired Dynamet a titanium alloy producer based in Washington, Pennsylvania, for $161 million.[4]
In 2009, Carpenter began supplying its cobalt-based BioBlu 27 alloy into the jewelry industry.[5] In 2010, Carpenter developed ACUBE 100 alloy, a beryllium-free material for bushings and bearings. Also in 2010, Carpenter launched PremoMet alloy to consider for high demand diesel engine components.
In 2011, the company acquired Houston-based Amega West Services for $54 million, which expanded Carpenter's business in the oil and gas drilling market.[6]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
On June 18, 2002, five plaintiffs filed a suit against Carpenter Technology to recover costs that had been paid to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cleanup the Boarhead Farms Superfund Site in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement of $21,800,000 was reached in 2011.
According to a 2009 article in the Philadelphia Business Journal, "Carpenter Technology Corp. near Reading released more than 1.2 million pounds of toxic chemical waste into the Schuylkill River and was the fourth-largest polluter of toxic chemicals in Pennsylvania in 2007"; however, it is not clear whether the discharge amounts were within the allowed federal permit limits.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
