	Forward-looking
	Statements






	 






	This
	press release contains “forward-looking statements.” Such statements may be preceded by the words “intends,”
	“may,” “will,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,”
	“predicts,” “estimates,” “aims,” “believes,” “hopes,” “potential”
	or similar words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, are based on certain assumptions and are
	subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, and cannot
	be predicted or quantified and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
	statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with (i) market acceptance
	of our existing and new products, (ii) negative clinical trial results or lengthy product delays in key markets, (iii) an inability
	to secure regulatory approvals for the sale of our products, (iv) intense competition in the medical device industry from much
	larger, multinational companies, (v) product liability claims, (vi) product malfunctions, (vii) our limited manufacturing capabilities
	and reliance on subcontractors for assistance, (viii) insufficient or inadequate reimbursement by governmental and other third
	party payers for our products, (ix) our efforts to successfully obtain and maintain intellectual property protection covering
	our products, which may not be successful, (x) legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in both the U.S. and
	foreign jurisdictions, (xi) our reliance on single suppliers for certain product components, (xii) the fact that we will need
	to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and that such capital raising may be costly, dilutive
	or difficult to obtain and (xiii) the fact that we conduct business in multiple foreign jurisdictions, exposing us to foreign
	currency exchange rate fluctuations, logistical and communications challenges, burdens and costs of compliance with foreign laws
	and political and economic instability in each jurisdiction. More detailed information about the Company and the risk factors
	that may affect the realization of forward looking statements is set forth in the Company’s filings with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
	Investors and security holders are urged to read these documents free of charge on the SEC’s web site at http://www.sec.gov.
	The Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information,
	future events or otherwise.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

					Full Description



InspireMD, Inc., incorporated on February 29, 2008, is a medical device company. The Company is focusing on the development and commercialization of its MicroNet stent platform technology for the treatment of vascular and coronary disease. Its MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is wrapped over a stent to provide embolic protection in stenting procedures. Its CGuard carotid embolic prevention system (CGuard EPS) combines its MicroNet and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Its MGuard Prime Embolic Protection System (MGuard Prime EPS) is marketed for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions (bypass surgery). It markets and sells MGuard Prime EPS, a bare-metal cobalt-chromium based stent, for the treatment of coronary disease in the European Union.The Company is also developing a neurovascular flow diverter (NGuard), which is an endovascular device that directs blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms in order to seal the aneurysms. It is also focusing on developing a pipeline of other products and additional applications by leveraging its MicroNet technology to applications to develop peripheral vascular and neurovascular procedures, such as the treatment of the superficial femoral artery disease, vascular disease below the knee and neurovascular stenting to open diseased vessels in the brain. The Company's MGuard Prime EPS coronary product comprises MicroNet wrapped around a cobalt-chromium based bare-metal stent. The MGuard Prime EPS is integrated with an engineered micro net mesh that is designed to prevent the unstable arterial plaque and thrombus that caused the heart attack blockage from breaking off.The Company competes with Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Medtronic plc, Cardinal Health, Inc., Gore Medical, Terumo Corporation, Stryker Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Penumbra, Inc., Merit Medical Systems, Inc., W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Microport Scientific Corporation and Medikit Co., Ltd.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A



Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
