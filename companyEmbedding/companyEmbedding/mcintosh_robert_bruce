Robert Bruce McIntoshTeacher, Repertory High School of Theatre Arts1993 AlumniBiographyTheater Studies
 1993 B.A.
 M.F.A Acting, Brandeis University
 M.S., Education, Long Island University
 Brooklyn, NY
Since Emory
As the artistic director of City Lights Youth Theatre, I developed and ran programs providing youth from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to participate in Theater experiences to develop confidence, responsibility, teamwork, and a greater sense of self and community. With The Children’s Aid Society, I founded and directed the award-winning, nationally recognized Advantage Theatre and Film Program, a comprehensive after-school performing arts program for New York City Junior High School students. As a senior teaching artist with ENACT, I designed curriculum and trained teaching artists and educators to use improvisation, theater games and drama therapy techniques to teach conflict resolution in New York City classrooms.
Directing credits include: Next Year in Jerusalem, Liberty the Musical (WorkShop Theatre), Women and Guns (Castillo Theatre), Scrooge and Marley, Captains and Courage (Barefoot Theatre Company), Fairytale (NYMF), The Grapes of Wrath, The Laramie Project, The Crucible, Metamorphoses, Somebody in America (City Lights), Lady of Copper, The Road to Freedom, Enough for All, First Lady, Romeo and Juliet (Theater Garden), The Laramie Project, Twelfth Night, Eurydice (Brooklyn High School of the Arts).
Acting credits include lead roles in Hamlet, Manly Men Doing Manly Things, The Suicide, Kingdom of the Sun and The Angry Young Man, a Modern Misanthrope.  Rob is a member of Actors Equity (AEA), the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society (SDC) and The WorkShop Theatre Company. He also juggles knives and flaming torches and rides a unicycle.
Current activities
I am currently the theatre teacher at Repertory High School of Theatre Arts.  I am an actor, director, teacher and the artistic director of Theater Garden, a non-profit theater company based in Brooklyn.
Highlights at Emory

Puck in A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Theatre Emory)
Fool in The Lear Project (Theater Emory)
Treplev in The Seagull (Theater Emory)
Wong the Water-seller in The Good Person of Setzuan
Brodin in Red Noses (a Theatre Emory / Starving Artists / Rathskeller co-production)
The Man in Scheherezade  (Starving Artists)
Directing Cymbeline (Starving Artists)
Emperor and High Priest of Rathskeller – especially fond recollections of The Mime Hunt and The King and the Queen, a 3 Act play in 3 Acts
Working with Tim McDonough, Vincent Murphy, Brenda Bynum, Michael Evenden, Leslie Taylor, Robert Schultz, Eugene Lazarev & Athol Fugard

In retrospect
I have been lucky enough to spend my whole life (so far) making and teaching theater and most of what I know and do I trace back to my work at Emory.  The faculty’s spirit of collaboration, professionalism and passion for authentic theatrical inquiry taught me what it means to be a theater artist and a teacher of theater.   The community of students and student theater groups taught me what it means to be part of an ensemble and a theater community and prepared me to run my own theater company and produce my own work. The professional and academic connections I made at Emory set me directly on the path to who and where I am today, and I couldn’t be happier about it.
