The Gabelli Global Utility & Income Trust
			Important Notice Regarding Change in Investment Policy








 



Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.  You can obtain more information about the Fund by calling 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554). The Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Stocks are subject to market, economic, and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investors acquire shares of the Fund on a securities exchange at market value, which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand.  Industry Concentration Risks. The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in foreign and domestic companies in the Utility Industry and, as a result, the value of the Fund’s shares will be more susceptible to the factors affecting those particular types of companies, including government regulation, inflation cost increases in fuel and other operating expenses, technological innovations that may render existing products and equipment obsolete, and increasing interest rates resulting in high interest costs on borrowings needed for capital construction programs, including costs associated with compliance with environmental and other regulations. As a consequence of its concentration policy, the Fund’s investments may be subject to greater risk and market fluctuation than a fund that has securities representing a broader range of alternatives.  Foreign Securities Risk. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign securities in which the Fund may invest. Investing in securities of foreign companies (or foreign governments), which are generally denominated in foreign currencies, may involve certain risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in domestic companies and could cause the Fund to be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates and revaluation of currencies.  Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.

Closed-end fund historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains, and return of capital.  For more detailed information on the distributions of a specific fund, please visit the sponsor's website.
NOTES:
† Distribution type sourced from Morningstar. For specific information about a fund's distribution sources, visit the fund sponsor's website.

				The following information applies to closed-end funds in general: Fund shares are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Shares of closed-end funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. There can be no assurance that fund objectives will be achieved. Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value. NAV returns are net of fund expenses, and assume reinvestment of distributions.
