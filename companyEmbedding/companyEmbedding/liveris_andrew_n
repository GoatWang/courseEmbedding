Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management.

The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]

Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Liveris: Why & How to Participate in China’s Transformation







Columbia Business School China Business Conference
Columbia University, New York
April 1, 2016
Remarks as prepared for delivery.
Thank you, Professor [Barry] Salzberg, for that introduction. And thank you all for welcoming me to this beautiful campus.
It is a privilege to be with so many future business leaders – including Kevin Wu and the Columbia Business School Greater China Society, who invited me here today.
I am honored to join you in discussing the next wave of surprises that China has in store.
And I am especially glad to be with you at such a pivotal moment in world history: because I believe that, far more than any political agreement or economic treaty, you – and your peers at similar schools in China – are the key to our political and economic future.
Your generation of leaders will decide whether China’s rise will lead to conflict, as some – like Henry Kissinger – conjecture may be inevitable: as an emergent power supplants an established power.
Or whether a powerful United States and a prosperous China can grow, succeed, and thrive together… peacefully sharing the world stage, avoiding the rhythms of history.
Experts like Henry Kissinger have argued for decades that competition is “embedded in human nature.” As students of competition, in a sense, I cannot imagine that you disagree!
But – with due respect to the experts – what shape that competition might take… and whether this crucial relationship between the world’s chief economic powers will be defined by dialogue, or by discord… is very much up to you.
CHINA: RISEN, AND RISING STILL
As you may know, I am Australian by birth, Greek by heritage, and I now live here in the United States.
But of all the places where I have lived and worked over the course of my career, none has commanded more of my attention, or fascination, than China.
I first traveled there 40 years ago – for one of my first jobs at The Dow Chemical Company. Since then, I have been back multiple times each year. I was in Beijing just last week, where I had the opportunity to speak with a group very much like this one at Tsinghua University. I am not exaggerating when I say that China surprises me every time I return!
I was lucky to have a front-row seat thirty years ago when Deng Xiaoping opened China to the world. And in the decades since, I have had the privilege of watching – and even better, participating – as China’s rise has transformed not only China, but the rest of the global economy.
These days, it seems China is at the center of every global conversation – from this forum… to last year’s U.N. conference on climate change… to the G20, which will convene in Hangzhou this September.
We are all China-watchers, and many of us are China students. And this has made many people quite sensitive to every fluctuation in China’s economic and policy environments: whether the latest news out of Beijing or the latest numbers out of Shanghai and Shenzhen.
DUAL HORIZONS
Many have been alarmed by the stock market turmoil we have seen in recent months. Some economists predict that China’s economy is in for a “hard landing.” They suggest a “severe adjustment period” is just around the corner.
We cannot be blithe about this volatility. But the fact is that China’s economy is in the midst of a once-in-a-generation transition: President Xi Jinping’s pivot away from the hazards of commodity exports… and toward the economic strength and stability that flow from higher levels of domestic consumption and tradable value.
This transformation began in 2012. It will continue for another five years – at least. But I believe it will prove even more critical than the Deng Xiaoping opening of thirty years ago, positioning the world’s second-largest economy for more sustainable growth and success.
That is why, despite the growing pains we will see in the short term, I disagree with the conventional wisdom.
I am not merely optimistic about China’s economy.
I am confident in China. I am bullish about China!
I am not suggesting that growth and prosperity will be automatic. That you can just throw a dart and hit a bulls-eye, so to speak, as you might have been able to do in China a decade ago.
On the contrary: we have real volatility to contend with. We will have to brave global headwinds and slowing growth… navigating short-term challenges in order to take advantage of long-term opportunities.
We will need to act like pilots do – keeping one eye on the instruments in front of us and the other on the distant horizon. I call this a “dual horizons” mindset. And it is the only way to weather this turbulence and keep moving toward our destination.
Positioning ourselves for success in China – today, tomorrow, and ten years from now – will not be easy.
But it is a matter of choice.
We can choose to participate. We can choose to be partners in this new phase of the Chinese economy.
If we do, I am confident this choice will be rewarded.
TWIN TRANSFORMATIONS
With the 13th Five Year Plan that President Xi unveiled last week, China’s government is accelerating its pivot to the domestic sector… transitioning from being an exporter of basic materials to a creator and consumer of high-tech goods and products.
At Dow, we have chosen to be part of this transformation. To help teach China how to build the demand side.
Even though we have been in the country for decades, we have not made the mistake of thinking we are owed anything. Because Dow does not want to be merely present for China’s transformation – or Saudi Arabia’s… or India’s… or Europe’s and America’s, for that matter.
We want to power these transformations. We want to help drive them.
This is why, ten years ago, we began a historic transformation of our own.
Ten years ago, Dow’s success depended on the commodities cycle. We rode it up and down like a roller coaster. But we had come to recognize that the path we were on was unsustainable. We saw that, at a time of increasing volatility, in a world where change moves at the “speed of live,” many industrial conglomerates were too big, complex, and unwieldy to survive.
So we chose a different path.
We transformed into an engine of innovation – a close partner to customers in solving their challenges. We adopted a philosophy I like to call “smart scale”: maintaining our industry leadership while honing our organizational agility.
As a result, our success is no longer driven by the cycle. It is driven by innovation and integration. And today’s Dow provides not just products, but solutions, to our customers. Because today’s Dow is nimble enough to go where the growth is.
SERVE THE RIGHT MARKETS
We transformed, in part, in order to serve the right markets.
In China today, that means helping the middle class grow.
By 2022, China’s middle class will grow to 630 million – twice the present U.S. population. This will create enormous demand for the high-value solutions our transformation has left us uniquely positioned to provide.
But again, this did not happen by accident. We chose this path. It has taken years to prepare ourselves for this opportunity.
Over a decade, Dow has positioned our product mix in China to be technology-driven, waiting for the country to shift its economy toward one that values high quality products… not just a large quantity of products.
Rather than selling commodities and reprocessing them for export – the China engine of yesteryear – we worked to fulfill essential needs… to build goods no one else can build… and to serve China’s consumer engine of today and tomorrow.
In 2009, we launched a world-class business and innovation center in Shanghai, our largest outside of the U.S., including state-of-the-art R&D facilities where more than 500 scientists and engineers work in 80 different labs. We have opened one new business center in China each year since 2012. And we broke ground just two weeks ago on a brand-new Dow Agricultural Sciences plant, in northeastern China, that will manufacture industry-leading products for China, and for the world.
Our transformation is allowing us to drive and capture value in new places… and even to achieve 10 percent year over year volume growth in 2015, in spite of the broader slowdown we have seen.
COLLABORATE LOCALLY, INNOVATE GLOBALLY
This is possible only because of Dow’s deep roots in East Asia.
It is because our transformation has been fueled by local collaboration… in pursuit of life-changing innovation.
I often say that Dow is a company of communities. We are where we operate. And this means we increasingly are China.
Our employees and leadership teams do not just work in the markets they serve. They are of these markets. And they can forge the strategic relationships that companies like Dow need: close, collaborative connections with NGOs and governments.
A perfect example of strategic collaboration in action is the U.S.-China Building Energy Efficiency Fund – an ambitious new partnership in which Dow plays a pivotal role.
Today, buildings are the source of roughly 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Our Energy Efficiency Fund will address this by reducing the costs of sustainable American technologies… while accelerating their development in China.
The Fund will also serve a broader, global good – helping to usher in a brighter future for people around the world.
This, too, is at the heart of China’s transformation, and at the center of the 13th Five Year Plan: an ambitious strategy that will bring the government’s focus on environmental and social well-being to the fore.
The Five Year Plan will achieve this by prioritizing emissions reduction… addressing the root causes of air pollution… and rallying stakeholders throughout the country to enhance sustainability both from the “bottom-up” and from the “top-down.”
The Plan will also strengthen the government’s enforcement of environmental regulations. It will bolster China’s environmental justice system. It will encourage investment in sustainable technologies and incentivize “green” business practices. Most importantly, it will mobilize both the Chinese public and partners in private enterprise to meet the considerable challenges ahead.
SUSTAINABILITY
After all, this work cannot be completed by government alone!
Overcoming today’s sustainability challenges will require solutions that can only be delivered by government, business, and civil society in close collaboration.
Consider that air pollution contributes to the deaths of a staggering 1.6 million Chinese citizens each year. That is 4,400 lives every day. And the problem is only getting worse.
Consider that, by 2025, 1.8 billion people – in China and around the world – will live in regions where clean water is scarce.
Consider that, by 2050 – as the global population tops nine billion – worldwide demand for food will increase by 60 percent. And all of humanity will be counting on sustainable solutions to address these urgent needs.
Fortunately, sustainability is also a pillar of Dow’s transformation. We share with China a steadfast belief that doing well by doing good is not only possible, but essential – even in today’s volatile environment.
With our 2025 Sustainability Goals, Dow is integrating the value of nature into everything we do. And our scientists in Shanghai are leading the way when it comes to inventing and manufacturing sustainable solutions – solutions that directly address priorities laid out in the new Five Year Plan:

To keep the air clear, our scientists have pioneered a first-of-its-kind formaldehyde abatement technology that gives paint incredible air-cleaning functionality, converting formaldehyde in the air into harmless water vapor.
To address the water challenge, Dow has worked with the Haier Group to commercialize the world’s first eco-friendly washing machine, which reduces water consumption more than 30 percent… while removing as much as 99 percent of bacteria during washing.
And to provide better food safety and extended shelf life, we have developed technologies like PackXpertTM, which has won the China Sustainable Package Technology Award and the “R&D 100” Award for its reduction in raw materials use – and its ability to protect more product in a lighter package.

CONCLUSION
Of course, innovation does not happen in a vacuum. Our ability to continue developing differentiated, sustainable solutions will depend on the government’s willingness to create an atmosphere conducive to innovation… friendly to entrepreneurial spirit… and founded on mutual trust.
I have conveyed directly to President Xi that he can count on Dow’s partnership as China embraces regulatory reform… and develops clear, rational rules of the road. Because Dow, like China, is focused on the future we can build together.
The theme of this conference, “Unveiling China’s Next Wave of Surprises,” stimulated me to think about China’s last wave of surprises, from the great opening of Deng Xiaoping’s China, circa 1983-2013. How, toward the end of these 30 years, China had become an export engine par excellence… but had left many of its citizens behind.
I remembered a session with Premier Wen Jiabao where he teared up when he spoke about the great achievement of bringing 300 million people out of poverty… but how many had been left behind. How the issues of corruption, income inequality, and real estate bubbles were endemic to the new China – and the new China was not inclusive.
President Xi Jinping is sweeping in an era of fundamental new reforms to solve these issues and many more. So I thought, as an avid China-watcher and Sinophile, that I could conclude my remarks to you today by having a list of China’s next wave of surprises over the next decade.
Here you go. Some are already obvious:

China will move to a phase of SOe’s… with a little “e.” China’s entrepreneurial ecosystem will be unique to China.
China’s consumers will outspend their U.S. counterparts, on a run-rate basis, by 2025.
China will keep a large agrarian economy, but will be a fast adopter of new technologies.
“Made in China” will be matched by “Invented in China.” And IP enforcement will become stronger and stronger.
China’s geopolitics will be led by their geo-economics – which will define their relationships with other countries.
And last but not least: China’s environmental stewardship will become exponentially better, and will be an exemplar in enforceable regulatory standards. We will all be able to breathe in Beijing again!

My final thought for you: do not let the 6.5 percent GDP growth number fool you. At a $10 trillion GDP, every year China adds a G20 economy.
Go East! There is opportunity and unique experience in every sector and on every street corner.
Thank you.

Following is the transcript of a CNBC interview with Andrew N. Liveris, CEO, Dow Chemical Company. The interview was broadcast on CNBC on 20 March 2017.
All references must be sourced to a "CNBC Interview".
Interviewed by Geoff Cutmore, Anchor, CNBC at China Development Forum 2017.

Geoff Cutmore: So let's start Andrew by just asking you how good or otherwise you feel about the growth momentum that the Chinese economy has right now.
Andrew N. Liveris: Look, the growth momentum in China is based on their pivot of a few years ago almost as President Xi came into power that discusses domestic sector growth economy rather than an export reliant economy. I'd say a few years in, it's going as well as they wanted. And for Dow surpassing our expectations because the other pivot that's occurred here is the obvious one of the environment.
I mean when they hit the food safety issues a few years ago when they hit the, you know, the issues of water and clean water in their riverways, if you look at the air and the air pollution especially in places in the urban centres like Beijing, they've accelerated their notion in the 13th five year plan speaks to it of putting in place sustainable growth. So, sustainable growth, if you put the technologies and the products, these are domestic sector purchases, these are companies being born all over China. SMEs to reform state-owns that are needing these technologies and that will create new types of growth. They call it high quality growth. So instead of high volume only, high quantity that's high quality.
GC: The government has been trying to restructure and reform, part of that has been down to the environmental story. But some of it has also been about access capacity around the state owned enterprises. They've also been slowly opening the door in some sectors of the economy where there has been limited access. Are you concerned at all that under the pressure they feel now from the American administration some of those progressive moves get rolled back or suspended?
AL: So that's, that's a very big question, has several big bite sized chunks. Let's go one by one and I'll give you the Dow view. The reforms as it relates to excess capacity in.. let's call it me two product lines that the state owned enterprises have been primarily involved in. They used to call those pillar industries. In essence those cutbacks, those factory shut downs mostly for environmental reasons but really because of structural capacity reasons - oversupply, they're not low on the cost curve here they're higher on the cost curve. Very few of those commodities do they have some sort of competitive edge. Those are being welcomed. Those are being, in fact Dow never participated in building petrochemicals here. We've built in places like Saudi Arabia or the United States that are much lower on the cost curve. And so the pivot from restructuring the structure of the supply side to working the demand side and then really look at the demand side as I said earlier as a domestic sector quality demand side to change the skills they need for the digital age to put in place efficient transportation smart cities and better food supply. All those technologies are innovation driven so low cost integration commodity, as a base fine they've got enough building on top of that an innovation centric economy through investment here in China like Dow has done. We have a very large R&D center, our second largest in the world is right here in China.
We have got 750 Chinese scientists working towards all these environmental drivers but also domestic drivers working with Haier to give them a more efficient washing machine so it uses less water and takes out bacteria; working with Nippon paints and take out pollutants in indoor air quality; and many other building projects and materials projects that I can quote. Those sorts of growth drivers are right in the sweet spot of technology driven companies. Now as it relates to the US administration and the back and forth that's begun and I want to emphasize the word begun. It's begun because what? The inequity perceived in global distribution of wealth is not just unique to emerging countries it's very much in the centrepiece of developing countries and the United States. You know what President Trump got elected on was very simple and that is the income distribution of the US economy as it became more and more of a service sector economy, the factory workers, the displaced workers of America didn't have a job to look forward to. And the conundrum there is there's a half a million science based jobs open in the United States as we speak. So what the issue is isn't really China-centric. The issue really is US-centric. How do I rekindle manufacturing the United States? Not by taking it away from someway but rekindling it in the United States. Now will that manifest itself into a discussion on trade? Absolutely. What's fair trade look like? You said it in your question. Access. Are all US companies being able to access the Chinese market equitably according to whether they are important whether they are local. No. So what does fair trade look like? And is it in fact what we used to have in trade agreements? That's a discussion that's opening up. I call that healthy. I, as a global company want to access the Chinese market, the US market, the South American market, every market on the same standard.
GC: So you don't think you get that access in China?
AL: Well so over all the years that we've been operating here we could never do a petrochemical complex without making it a joint venture. Technology transfer had to occur in China's first manifestation of economic growth. Now that they've got their own technology they need it less. Service sector countries, companies can't access this market. The financial services insurance companies, health sector, sector companies. So those you know access issues on investment, not necessarily on trade of goods are importing. China has been pretty good under WTO standards. We can import pretty much everything here as a manufacturer from elsewhere but to invest here - we didn't have equal access.
GC: But do you not feel conflicted that you are now perceived to be part of Donald Trump's drive for "America first" when your business makes two thirds of its revenue from the rest of the world?
AL: The question is flawed because I am not part of anyone's drive to make America first. I'm part of President Trump's activity to rekindle manufacturing so it's not a zero sum game. And that is fundamental, is the answer to your question. This is not a zero sum game. We all know that. People who trade in the global system, we know what has to happen here and to satisfy a population's feeling of inequity, globalization hasn't been fair. Think about it this way, America pretty much since World War 2 has been a consumption economy. In essence you can import pretty much anything to America and sell it in America in any environment retail or in the channel you want. To invest in America, there hasn't been any incentive to invest other than the market. So whether you're an importer or an investor if you're a consumption economy, the American economy is the best in access. Every other economy is an investment economy. Even Europe has protections around investment. So I would say to you there is a recalibration going on globalization. Think of it as not consumption but investment. I want to be part of that conversation. So I get a better answer for the Dow chemical company.
GC: You have a very nuanced view on this strategy. The problem is that people read the headlines and they see the fact that Steve Mnuchin was unprepared to put an anti protectionist language in the G20 communique that sends a terrible message doesn't it? To anybody that believes that free trade lifts income levels for everybody?
AL: So people elect governments, governments do what they have to do to protect their people. We should not judge why the democratic process elects this or that. Dow is 120 years young. We work with every government. And I've been CEO for a dozen years. I work with every government in the United States, every government around the world. Including this one here. So I am not afraid of headlines. It's the body of work that goes below the headlines. That's more important behind every statement, there's a body of work that has to happen. And I would say very important to the US government is job creation in the manufacturing base of America. And if you look at the raw data, America has lost that battle the last three decades. It wants to regain footing. Now there are some advantages - entrepreneurial, best universities in the world, energy, low cost energy. The petrochemical chemical sector that I belong to, investing 180 billion dollars as we speak, Dow 7 billion dollars. So we are not starting from zero. So what businesses like ours have to do is help with the body of work together to get America what it needs investment and growth and job creation for the new age not yesterday's era the new era. And then grow from there off of a flat level playing field. I'm all for that in any country.
GC: But I mean not to get too theoretical about this but Ricardian comparative advantage is all about trade happening to the advantage of both parties. And if you can manufacture at a lower cost somewhere else trying to bring those jobs back to America is trying to reverse the rules of economics isn't it?
AL: Yeah, and we're not going to spend an awful lot of time at this point because it's a one or two hour interview probably. But please remember what's happened to the world based on technology the industrial age 4.0 the fourth industrial revolution is creating this another, another pressure it's enormous on job creation. It's in essence the digitization of industries not just digitization of communication or even digitization of e-Commerce which everyone in the in the world probably understands somewhat if you're an online shopper or for sure use a smartphone.
But the digitization of manufacturing has begun. And companies like Dow are digitizing. That means we're not creating the same sort of jobs we used to create. So the war on human capital and the war on job creation has moved and the governments that get that, when they rebuild their manufacturing sectors to this new economy have to look at skills, look at their education system and they have to look at many things that other countries might do and build them all together like Germany and apprenticeship programs. Many of us have become universities in our own right because the universities are not giving us what we need. So when you look at competitive advantage think of it in the context of the technology age. And what we haven't done to prepare our kids and frankly the displaced workers out there mostly in Western economies we can't protect them. We have to skill them, we have to help them get these new skills to deal with robotics and automation and the Internet of Things and the digitization of every factory floor and in by so doing we create an ecosystem of new jobs.
And I mentioned earlier half a million of these jobs are opened in the United States as we speak. Me? Yeah. We're not going to get there overnight but we can make that happen faster if (we) cooperate with governments and get them into the right programs.
GC: But let's just bring this back to a human level, look we understand the points that you're making and I'm sure as you've explained them to people that you've spoken to here as you've gone into some of the details perhaps their eyes widened and they've gone, now I start to see some of the reasons why you're involved. But you must also be getting some pressure here I would imagine. A little bit of blowback particularly from the Chinese who see you now as being a party to an administration that's had relatively harsh language towards this government.
AL: Look, I've been coming to China since the 70s. One thing I know about the Chinese culture in the Chinese people and Chinese leadership, they never overreact. They are patient and they seek to understand. The meetings I've had frankly have been nothing like you describe. They've been more... Well, now that you're inside discussing this and understanding it the way you're understanding it. Tell me a lot more about it and how does it apply to the relationship. And I'm getting that sort of question. And you know I won't push back on the label you're giving me. Remember I'm a global CEO. You said those statements earlier.
GC: And you're in a unique position of having helped both administrations. You were also involved with President Obama's administration. As you compare the approaches of the two, how do you feel what Trump is doing is more effective in terms of rolling back some of the red tape and the barriers to you doing business?
AL: Yeah the distinction is interesting because the three pillars of activity are almost the same. The work products on what are the technologies of the future? What are the policies to encourage them? How do we get the workforce skilled? The emphasis in this administration is the last two. The workforce skilling and training and finding national programs that make sense as recent as yesterday, two days ago in the United States. We had a meeting on that when the German chancellor visited. How did we learn from Germany and then most importantly the point you made? How do we take out these headwinds to enable manufacturing to invest in this country in the US again?
Just to give you one step. The average regulatory cost to a US manufacturer is a small medium and large, is roughly $19,500 per employee per year. The average cost to all other sectors is less than half of that at $9,900. So the manufacturing sector has his added burden at double the rate of every other sector. So just working on that alone. Forget everything else that gets done would immediately enable the policy environment to have an effect on investment. There are many other things I could talk about but those two areas, regulatory and training, those two areas our emphasis points on this administration.
GC: On the regulatory, and I am going to wrap it up here because I know you need to go off. Let me just ask you then about the process here to finally get this deal over the line with DuPont, because it's felt torturous I think to me looking from the outside. So it must have felt even tougher for you on the inside here. You're talking now about a second quarter closure of this. How frustrating though has this regulatory process been?
AL: So antitrust regulatory, regulators around the world whether they be the EU or China or in the US any time too big businesses get together, you know, we were expecting that there would be some of this. It's taken much longer in Europe than we imagine, because there was a very decent thesis put out by the regulator that we had to respond to that it had never been raised before. And also the context of the deal changed. The other deals that happened pretty much right after us, changed the context of our deal. No matter which way you want to say it you couldn't just look at our deal and say well I'm looking at those other two coming along. So that created a series of delays. You mentioned a second quarter. So first half is what we said. I'm very confident we're going to get there. In fact first half is what we're all planning on. We have put in place now all the programs to get us ready for day one. We're gearing up down DuPont are getting ready to create this new company that will then have three companies spun out of it. The regulatory remedies for sure have been frustrating. I've used a line which I'm going to use on you three months of delay in the context of $30 million of new value – fine.
GC: But couldn't Europe do with a little bit of Trump va va voom when it comes to getting these things to run a bit faster?
AL: There are plenty of people commenting on what the EU is like and what there isn't and including from the US right now. My experience with the EU is 27 nations trying to – the EU 27 – trying to make a decision on pretty much anything is dramatic, but its own bureaucracy rate. So yeah, could it have been easier and simpler? For sure. But look, I see a finish line. So you know what. Whatever it took to get from there to that finish line - fine. I'm a big boy. We know how to get this done. This deal is phenomenal, when it's day one I can look at it and say that's all memory, faded memory.

      We need the next President to start thinking about employing psychologists vs. economists. I would tell you the credit crisis, the financial crisis, that became almost tsunami-like in September; now that it's spilled over into the real economy, we have a crisis of confidence at the consumer end. I think people have anxieties, and are fearful, and I think arresting that fear and turning the tide will need some interventions and pretty quick address. I would tell you that the length of this recession both in the U.S. and beyond on the globe will be determined by how quickly the next President acts, and let's call it "put in place an FDR effect." I mean, get in place as fast as possible the transition teams, work with the Treasury Secretary and the outgoing Administration, and really start to frame economic stimuli that will create a sense of confidence in the American economy going forward.
      
      
      
      
Deficit and Stimulus

The deficits and how much we owe, as hard as it is for me to say this, almost have to be put to one side. I think we need to put some real money into the economy. Not only the fiscal tools such as cutting interest rates, but whether they be tax benefits and providing some checks to the American people, some help on mortgages, all the things that have to be done in ailing industries; for sure, the auto industry needs help. All these things are going to cost money, and they are going to cost money in the very short term. You know, I just came back in from China, and they are putting money into their economy through infrastructure spending, and spending on alternative energy. These sorts of programs both candidates have spoken about are putting money directly back into the economy now. Not waiting a year from now, but now.
And I think those sorts of interventions will not only impart new lifeblood into the economy but frankly create a sense of confidence that it's O.K. to borrow again, it's O.K. to spend again. Now, as you look at more medium- and long-term policies, you've got to get the words "efficient borrowing" and "efficient spending" in there. But for now we have to correct the downward slope that we're on. Because we're either going to make this a V-shaped recession, a U-shaped recession, or an L-shaped recession. An L-shaped recession, obviously I don't even need to speak about that. A U-shaped—if the bottom of that U is two years or more, we're going to get some real chronic hurt out there in terms of people who lose jobs, the American economy's competitiveness, and frankly the globe as a whole will suffer.









The Next Administration

Both campaigns, leading into the election and beyond the election, realize that the American economy needs to put in place some medium- and long-term fixes such as the ones I raised. I think it's the responsibility of CEOs, the responsibility of many industry sectors, such as the ones I've been talking about, to step up and be part of that solution space. To help our politicians—Administration, Congress—not approach things in a partisan way, but a bipartisan way, for America, really make them live up to their promise for why they got elected in the first place, which is to find solutions that matter for America. I believe we can't stay silent and stay on the sidelines and just beat the drum and say, "This is what you should do." We should come forward, really stick our necks out, and say, "This is what should happen, and in some of the cases frankly we'll have to give a little to get the right answers." An address to climate change is a great example. Every sector will have to give a little for the greater good, including my sector. And I think "For the Greater Good" needs to be the headline that we all operate under for the next couple of years to address this complex agenda that I just laid out.

Energy





I've been an active proponent of two policies that, if they are not put into place, then the American economy's competitiveness will continue to be hollowed out. One I believe is getting full address, and that's energy policy. Both candidates have now stepped forward and have articulated what their vision for energy policy is. We in the chemical industry and we at Dow Chemical are strong supporters of alternatives, and so whether it be green chemistry, biochemistry, or biofuels, wind, solar, all those tools that we have at our disposal are very necessary. However, a full energy policy needs to include all components. We've articulated the efficiency side of the equation, the increased production of fossil fuels, clean fossil fuels, a component that's nuclear, and on top of that all of the alternatives. And so that I believe is Job One, Two, and Three. Without an energy policy our industry will continue to build factories and invest in jobs overseas. Other countries are putting in place very, very sound energy policies that include all of those components.

Industrial Policy





The second thing that we've been pushing for, Dow in particular, is a readdress to industrial policy. You know America has become uncompetitive in industry. Industry is only 16% of this economy, although that 16% is over $1.5 trillion, and employs literally 10 million Americans in manufacturing. But we don't have sound tax policy. We have a very broken tort system. We have a poor health benefit pension system. We have, of course, the regulatory issues. Very bad regulations that over the years have become worse, and of course this whole thing on energy. Those five things, when you put them together, make American industry uncompetitive compared with the OECD countries like Germany and Japan—forget labor costs. So I believe an approach to the industrial sector needs to occur in this country. Industry generates R&D. Seventy percent of nongovernment R&D comes from industry.

Education








                        The most important business stories of the day.

Industry employs young graduates from our industry and into high-paying jobs. And as you know, a lack of an address into chemistry, engineering, and science is hollowing that out as we speak to places like China and India and elsewhere, and we at Dow are noticing it. We are finding more talent overseas than in the U.S., which is a travesty to the American university system, which is still the best in the world.
So you put all those things together—that's a lot of fix that needs to occur. I believe working closely with industry, our industry, other industries, the next Administration needs to put these policies into place.

Gallery: A local look at Dow Chemical Co. over the years





    
        
            By Mark Tower
mtower@mlive.com





MIDLAND, MI -- The chief executive officer of Dow Chemical Co. plans to "transition out of the company" in less than two years.
Andrew N. Liveris, a 40-year veteran of the Midland-based chemical giant, on Tuesday, Feb. 2, reiterated his plans to step down when a merger with DuPont is complete, according to a company spokesperson.

The statement, made during a conference call to discuss the appointment of James "Jim" R. Fitterling as president and chief operating officer, was a reiteration of an announcement the CEO made when the pending merger with DuPont was announced in December, according to the spokesperson.
Liveris' departure is expected to occur 18 to 24 months following the closing of the merger, subject to regulatory and board approval, officials said.
Liveris plans to leave the company once "the spins are in place," according to a company spokesperson. That is expected in about 18 months, or the second quarter of 2017.
When the merger between Dow and DuPont was announced, Dow also announced it would fully acquire its joint venture, Bay County-based Dow Corning Corp.
The result will be a new combined company with a market capitalization of approximately $130 billion called DowDuPont.
DowDuPont subsequently will be separated into three independent, publicly-traded companies: an agriculture company with $19 billion in revenue, a material science company with $51 billion in revenue and a specialty products company with $13 billion in revenue.

Liveris, who lives in Midland with his wife Paula, has served as Dow's chief executive officer for more than a decade.
He was born in Darwin, Australia, and later graduated from the University of Queensland in Brisbane with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. 
His four-decade career at Dow Chemical has, according to his biography on the company's website, "spanned roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management around the world."
Fitterling, who has worked with Dow for 32 years, previously held the positions of Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer.
James R. Fitterling
In his new role as president, he will continue to have executive accountability for all of Dow's businesses, excluding Dow AgroSciences. The new president and chief operating officer will continue to report to Liveris.
According to the press release from the company, Fitterling will "play a central role in helping drive the successful completion" of the proposed merger between Dow and DuPont announced in December and the "subsequent establishment of its three independent public companies."
When announcing Fitterling's appointment, Liveris expressed his confidence in Fitterling's leadership during work on the merger, which he described as "well underway" and the creation of the resulting three companies.
"Jim has been a tremendous leader for Dow for more than three decades and has spent his entire career at our great company," he said. "His appointment to the position of President is well deserved and a reflection of his abilities and commitment to our company.
"In Jim and our Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider, I am pleased to have two outstanding leaders as part of the senior leadership team at Dow leading this historic transformation of our company and our industry. I look forward to working closely with both of them to bring that transformation to completion," Liveris said in a statement.

























 
 


Aerial flyover of Dow's new corporate campus in Midland
Dow Chemical Co. plans to finish work in 2017 on a new six-story building with room for 600 employees. The new building will replace the Willard H. Dow Center 2020 building and serve as the centerpiece of the company's corporate headquarters in Midland.




Dow Chemical, a Fortune 50 company with about 53,000 employees worldwide, has more than a century of history in Midland. Earlier this year, company officials announced plans to build a new six-story corporate center there.
The new 150,000-square-foot building is to replace the current 2020 Willard H. Dow Center in Midland, and will be part of the company's 150-acre corporate headquarters campus located off East Patrick Road.
Dow Chemical has more than 6,000 product families manufactured at 201 sites in 35 countries.
Last year, the company had annual sales of more than $58 billion. Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was about $9 billion.

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

Early life and education[edit]
Liveris was born in Darwin, Australia. He is proud of being the grandson of a Greek immigrant and identifies strongly with his Greek heritage.[1][5] He attended Darwin High School until 1974 when Darwin was hit by Cyclone Tracy. He then moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Brisbane State High School.[1]
He earned a bachelor's degree (first-class-honors) in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.[6] In 2005 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by his alma mater as well as being named Alumnus of the Year.[7]
Business career[edit]
Transforming Dow[edit]
Liveris began his career at Dow in 1976 in Melbourne, Australia.[5] He spent much of his career in Asia before coming to North America, with roles in manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and business and general management. Liveris spent 14 years in Hong Kong and served as Dow's general manager in Thailand before becoming head of Dow's entire Asia-Pacific operations.[8][7]
Liveris joined Dow's Board of Directors in February 2004, becoming CEO in November 2004.[9] Liveris, appointed CEO in 2004 after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform Dow, began to implement the new strategy. His plan called for Dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals, plastics and advanced materials (including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds). The plan also called for reducing Dow's exposure to commodity chemical and plastics, which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the Middle East and Asia, who benefit from cost advantages. Part of the plan to "de-risk" the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up Dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above. The formation of joint ventures had the further virtue of assuring a low-cost supply of feedstocks for the customer-facing portion of Dow's business. Dow has fully exited some basic chemical and plastic business (as with the sale of Styron).[10]
His election to Chairman of the Board became effective 1 April 2006.[11] In 2008, under Liveris' leadership as CEO, Dow was ranked 13th on Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine's list of top 100 best corporate citizens.[12]
Rohm and Haas acquisition[edit]
Liveris' strongest move to implement the strategy came with the purchase of Rohm and Haas in the summer of 2008 for $16.2 billion. This Fortune 500 company, a leader in speciality chemicals, was the subject of a global auction, which Dow won with a bid of $16.2 billion. The acquisition proved to be synergistic in terms of growth, allowing a broader and deeper presentation to clients with regard to value-added chemicals, plastics, and materials, but also in terms of costs.[13]
The acquisition closed soon after the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 took hold. The credit crisis caused one of Dow's joint venture partners, Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), to withdraw from a planned partnership in basic plastics, despite an agreed contract, depriving Dow of $9 billion in proceeds designated to fund the Rohm and Haas deal. The London-based International Court of Arbitration ruled in March 2012 to award Dow $2.16 Billion plus cost and interest from Kuwait due to its cancellation of the 2008 agreement.[14]
During the Rohm and Haas acquisition, in December 2008, Liveris was quoted as saying "Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912. That is 388 consecutive quarters. I have said it before, but I want to say it again, we will not break that streak. Not Dow, not on my watch".[13] The following quarter Dow cut its dividend by 65%.[15] In a press release announcing the quarterly dividend (12 February 2009) Dow's board of directors stated its decision was based on "a confluence of factors, including uncertainty in the credit markets, unprecedented lower demand for chemical products, the ongoing global recession and pending business issues."[16]
In March 2009, Liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the Rohm and Haas integration, focusing on growth and cost synergies, but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings, along with equity offers. The plan also called for the divestiture of non-strategic assets, which was accomplished through a sales process that assured maximum valuation.[17]
Dow growth and first federal appointments[edit]
In March 2010, Liveris reported a first quarter 48.9% sales increase at Dow Chemical. He attributed his success to accelerated growth in performance business, including advanced polymers in the textile, health care, electronic, and agricultural industries.[18][19]
Liveris has continued to form joint ventures for the basics business, including an initiative in chlor-alkali with the Mitsui Group in Japan as a partner.[20] The recovery plan has been accompanied by a sixfold recovery in the share price.
An advocate for the importance of manufacturing to the long-term health of a nation's economy, Liveris was appointed in July 2010 to the President's Export Council by President Barack Obama. The Council advises the government on increasing exports, to foster job creation and support U.S. economic growth.[21][22][23]
In June 2011, Liveris was named an inaugural co-chair (with Susan Hockfield) of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), formed by President Obama. The AMP was a private sector task force including government, industry, and academic leaders, formed "to identify the most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities to improve the technologies, processes and products across multiple manufacturing industries" and advise the U.S. government.[24][25]
Later time as CEO, audit controversy[edit]
In 2015, concerns were raised by Dow's internal auditing department about Liveris's personal spending. Auditors testified that he used the company's Customer Events Department for personal events including family events and various services. The Liveris family subsequently repaid several hundred thousand dollars to Dow. Also, the head of the auditing department retracted the annual auditing reports for multiple years due to concerns for inaccurate reporting to SEC and shareholders.[26]
In March 2017, he said the ban on onshore gas exploration by the Victorian Government in Australia was "nonsense," and that he offered "Dow’s unfettered help with no intended positives for Dow" in learning extraction techniques.[27]
In April 2017, Dow said that it was considering retaining Liveris beyond his planned retirement on 30 June 2017, to help oversee the planned merger between Dow and DuPont.[28] In May, Dow said that Liveris would retire from the DowDuPont company mid-2018, serving as executive chairman until between April and July 2018.[29]
Manufacturing council[edit]
In December 2016, Liveris was named by Donald Trump to lead his American Manufacturing Council.[30][31] Liveris said Trump created a climate that is condusive to business effectiveness for his company.[32]
On 27 January 2017, Trump publicly announced the names of the 28 members to make up the council,[33] with Liveris heading the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.[34]
Discussing tax, trade,[35] and cutting regulations on businesses, in January 2017 Liveris and other business figures met with Donald Trump. Liveris and the other executives were tasked with returning to the White House a month later to suggest how to increase US manufacturing, reporting to Wilbur Ross. Liveris said it was "an exciting moment for Dow, and, frankly, the country," as he believed Trump would help promote "fair trade."[36]
In February 2017, Liveris organized a manufacturing working group to meet with Trump, which included executives from major companies to talk about job growth and economic policies.[37] The council met with Trump on 23 February 2017. Speaking for the council on that day, Liveris said the 24 CEOs were "encouraged by [Trump administration] pro-business policies" The CEOs present that day represented companies that employ 2 million.[38][39]
Also in February 2017, Liveris was standing next to Trump when the executive order "mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations" was signed.[40] Trump afterwards gave him the pen.[41]
Writing[edit]
Make it in America[edit]
Liveris is the author of Make it in America : the case for re-inventing the economy (first published 2011, updated 2012) [42] which presents a comprehensive set of practical policy solutions and business strategies. It builds upon ideas presented in the Dow Chemical Company's 'Advanced Manufacturing Plan', announced in June 2010. Liveris argues that a healthy manufacturing sector is essential to creating jobs. Failing to support American manufacturing, as well as research and development, undermines America's potential to engage in new growth sectors such as clean energy and nanotechnology. Instead, other nations are establishing themselves in these areas. Liveris outlines an agenda that he believes will establish a sustainable economic model for the United States.[43][44] Make It in America was named No. 9 on the Inc./800-CEO-READ Business book best-seller list for 2011.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Liveris serves on the board of directors of IBM and is a member of the executive committee of the Business Roundtable. Liveris is also a former president of the International Council of Chemical Associations.[46] He served as Vice-Chairman of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012, and as chairman for 2013 and 2014.[47][48][49][50] He is a member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the American Australian Association.[51]
Liveris is on the board of trustees for the United States Council for International Business and is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. Liveris is a member of the Business Advisory Board for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School. In April 2012 he became a member of the Special Olympics International board of directors.[52][53][54]
Liveris collaborated with Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, George David, Chairman of the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and George Stamas, Partner at Kirkland and Ellis LLP, to found The Hellenic Initiative (THI), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and job-creation investments in Greece.[55]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
