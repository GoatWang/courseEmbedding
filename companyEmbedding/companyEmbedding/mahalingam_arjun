World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Establishment of causal correlation between action and possible harmb.      Assessing the probability for harmDuong and Loisel (2001)An actuarial approachAnalogues such as natural gas pipelines and existing coal fired power plantswere used for risk estimation from CCSPrimary finding was that a few hundred fatalities per year should be expected  Contrary to most published literature, they suggest that risk of leakage is the least important with respect to ‘objectively expected fatalities’.Centralized decisions that impose risks demand a justification--> Consent of affected people needed.Best method to judge moral acceptability.Consent to risk →-> example of 'Unpleasant way'Consent to gamble  not consent to loss, similarly consent to CCS  ‘not consent to damage from CCS’Koornneef et al. 2001Focuses on several important knowledge gaps in literatureSecond step of CCS chain: Absence of dispersion models for leakage. Final step of chain - the storage - no certainty in terms of quantifiable estimates of probabilities of leakage involvedRights bar others from doing anything to us without our consent -->  CCS cannot be imposed by governments without consent from people.If equal distribution of risk, then CBA coincides with (hypothetical) consent With CCS, risk not equally distributed, while benefits are. CBA is ill-equipped to deal with uncertaintyRisk imposition is morally possible if and only if everybody subjected to risk  accepts the risk.‘Harm to you cannot be straightforwardly compensated by benefits to me’ - LenmanIn the case of CCS, matters are more troublesome when some will benefit more than others.Formulating a system of risk taking where everyone is benefited is not practically possible given the case of CCS -- HanssenConclusionThough, Contractualist approach is able to rule out situations where everyone benefits, it does not provide a solution to the risk imposition in the context of CCS implementation.Given existing knowledge and estimations using analogues, cost benefit analysis indicates that risks are comparable to those of existing technologies. However, when epistemic uncertainties come into the picture, CBA has little to say.ConventionalismPrima Facie RightsA prima facie right is a right that cannot be outweighed by other considerations.Every individual has a prima facie right not to be subjected to risky activity.When benefits from the risk are high, risk imposition is accepted.It is still unclear whether the degree of benefits would outweigh the amount of risk taken when CCS is implemented.Prima facie rights not to be subjected to risk is a moral outcome of finding consent important.Consequentialist:  no compensation needed when one has approved the risk in the first place. Prima facie right:  compensation not appropriate for overriding.Applying Prima facie rights to environmental issues like CCS is not helpful because everyone does not benefit equally, for a given risk.Duty-based ethics , based on normsAll actions entail a certain amount of riskAvoiding all risks ---> leading to PARALYSISNot known for sure if the risks involved in implementation of CCS << than choosing not to do soParalysis maybe avoided when there is a facility to recompense those whose rights have been violatedIssues with compensation :   who will compensate and how much and to whom? - distributive justiceHow would the amount of risk being subjected or harm being inflicted by enumerated?    in certain cases where the consequences of the risk are not great, compensation may also be seen as an incentive to be subjected to greater amounts of risk for monetary benefits.Conventionalism argues that while discussing risk, there is an intuitive element that contributes to making a certain risk imposition more or less morally problematic.Risks with large catastrophic effects and risks with irreversible effects are more problematic and more compelling to people - risk perception literature. Risks and uncertainties (large scale leakage) associated with CCS have both these characteristics.Free-floating fear -  immediate reflex to possible threat   Those are exposed to risk but not harmed will not be compensated despite having to live with the fear of harm that might possibly be inflicted on themCONCLUSION -  Either measures against the pervasive nature of free floating fear are to be adopted or CCS must not be adopted at all.AFA considers geo-engineering an evil, so the burden of proof that CCS is harmless lies on those advocating CCS.AFA doesn’t say how it is an evil. When it is unclear if it is an evil in itself, how can PP be applied?Its application has other shortcomings : can we apply PP if only a small community anticipates a risk in implementing CCS?There is no established basis where PP can be applied like when and how?“Precaution” is vague There is ambiguity in language & chances of misinterpretation are largeWidespread Statement version gives a totally different interpretation for the  PP, resulting in totally disparate outcomesCONCLUSION : CCS proposed as a mitigation measure, but applying PP to a solution to a problem? Something doesn’t add up...adds to the skepticism!Effective involvement of the public in the decision-making process involving risk management.Mainly to estimate the accepted levels of risks. Methods :Compare with existing levels of accepted riskCompare with standard levels used as a measureWhether the existing levels of risk are best possible levels?Should we bother about this now?  Based on goal : Common good (or) social acceptanceCONCLUSIONS: Involve the people who are subjected to risk in the joint decision making bodyProper mix of technocratic and democratic viewpoints is imperativeConventionalist - compelling argument against the implementation of CCS unless consent is obtained from people exposed to risk, under objective information dissemination.Rebuttal of Reviews"Not all aspects from the first part of the paper end up being actually represented in the decision tree"To formulate a logical and coherent decision tree, we only consider ethical approaches that are most relevant at each of the nodes."The authors seem to treat, risk, uncertainties and knowledge gap as almost interchangeable notion. It might be helpful to distinguish these"Knowledge gaps refer to epistemic uncertainty and these have been clearly demarcated from risks of CCS, although the terms themselves have not been clarified individually."How do you deal with public opinion being dependent on a large number of exogenous factors and how is this addressed in your paper?"This is a ubiquitous factor throughout the decision tree, we give it a special mention and do not deal with it extensively."What is your counterfactual? If not CCS, then what? At least some consideration should be given to the alternatives."The objective of this paper was to assess the justifiability of implementation of CCS; attention to alternatives would in itself demand a separate discussion.`CCSObjective: To analyze the justifiability of risk imposed by carbon capture and storage from an ethical standpoint.Full transcriptMore presentations by

Arjun Mahalingam









Faculty & researchCentresRisk StudiesPeopleThe team






Research Assistant, Centre for Risk Studies  
BE (Delhi University), MSc (TU Delft), MSc (LSE)
Professional experienceArjun Mahalingam is a Data Researcher at the School's Centre for Risk Studies, where he works on an ambitious project, Project Pandora, that aims to model all-ills under a unified framework. He is currently developing Sovereign Default threat scenarios (trillion dollar loss events) and use cases to model large shocks that propagate to the financial networks to enable his team to analyse its implications for hedging through dynamic rebalancing in various investment portfolios. He would also jointly develop a shadow banking system module to integrate with the larger global banking networks model to investigate the financial catastrophe impacts on the interconnected systems. In addition he proactively provides ad-hoc empirical research assistance on analysing contingent-convertible (cocos) bonds data to support a professor at MIT Economics with his ongoing research. He previously worked for two years for the School's Energy Policy Research Group (EPRG), wherein he analysed energy subsidy and carbon price scenarios, and provided high-impact policy and business recommendations that were aimed at facilitating cost-effective renewable energy investments. 
Previous appointmentsArjun is a mechanical engineer by undergraduate education and has two postgraduate degrees. He has a MSc in Sustainable Energy Technology from TU Delft, specialising in modelling of complex adaptive systems, and also a MSc in Finance and Economics from the London School of Economics (LSE), specialising in monetary economics. At the LSE, his research focus was developing an econometric framework for haircuts allocation for collateralised liquidity provision by the European Central Bank (ECB), and at TU Delft he independently developed a decision support tool using agent-based modelling (ABM) to study the economic impacts of various demand response pricing policies in the Netherlands. He was a pro bono volunteer with Elsevier where he worked remotely as a research ambassador with the Journal of Monetary Economics (JME) for a year. Additionally, he has held visiting research positions at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  
Research interestsArjun is very keen on exploring effective ways to integrate his economics education, modelling expertise and research experience to broaden the frontiers of understanding systemic risk and contagion in banking and financial networks using machine learning in big data. His research interests are in systemic risk and liquidity management, financial crises, stress testing in financial networks and monetary policy. In line with his aspirations to become a life-long learner, he currently takes a math course online in Real Analysis, Convexity and Optimization for credit from Harvard University, in addition to other course offerings in macro-econometric forecasting (IMF) and economic network theory (Stanford University) in order to further expand his competencies in preparation for his PhD research in the future.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
