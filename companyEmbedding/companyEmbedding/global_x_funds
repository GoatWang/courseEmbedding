NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Global X Funds, the New York-based provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today launched the Global X Founder-Run Companies ETF (BATS: BOSS). Tracking the Solactive U.S. Founder-Run Companies Index, BOSS will hold a basket primarily consisting of U.S. large and mid-cap companies led by CEOs who are the original founders of their firms. The fund will be the fourth in Global X's "Alpha" suite of funds, designed with the aim of delivering market-beating returns.








The founder/CEOs of companies currently held in BOSS boast 10 times higher equity ownership in their companies than the average S&P 500 CEO.i Further, in-depth studies have concluded that founder/CEOs instill an owner's mindset in their firms, which consists of a unique set of core practices, values, and attitudes that can positively influence their company's success over the long term.ii 
"Bringing BOSS to market reinforces our goal of providing unique solutions for investors that are based on academic research and sound index construction," said Alex Ashby, director of product development at Global X. "Founders bring a unique vision and innovative culture to their companies that we believe will translate into more sustainable long-term growth." 
High equity ownership, bolstered by an emotional attachment to a company they have grown from the start, may cause founder/CEOs to take a longer term view of growing their businesses. For example, these companies tend to avoid excess indebtedness, averaging 52% lower debt-to-equity ratios than the average S&P 500 company.iii

NEW YORK, July 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Global X Funds, the New York-based provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today launched the Global X Conscious Companies ETF (KRMA). The ETF tracks a proprietary index created by Concinnity Advisors, which draws on dozens of sources to identify companies that have demonstrated a long term focus on creating positive outcomes for a variety of stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, suppliers, and stock and debt holders. The fund is the twelfth in Global X's suite of thematic funds, and the second in its "Values" category.








More than $6 trillion have been invested into sustainable & responsible investing themes, according to the US Sustainable Investment Forum. With the goal of providing investors a more comprehensive approach to this theme, KRMA's holdings have undergone a three step screening process, which analyzes their adherence to the academically-backed Multi-stakeholder Operating System (MsOS). The index is a research-driven approach, which positively identifies companies that operate their businesses in a sustainable and responsible manner.
"Investors are increasingly looking at socially responsible investing not only as a values-driven decision, but also as one that can potentially lead to better long term returns," said Alex Ashby, director of product development at Global X. "Companies that demonstrate a commitment to the Multi-stakeholder Operating System tend to treat each of their stakeholders well and take a longer term view of corporate performance. By partnering with Concinnity Advisors, who are experts in assessing the MsOS approach, our goal was to bring to market a product that identifies the companies that are achieving positive outcomes across all stakeholder groups and are setting the standard for taking a responsible and sustainable approach to operating a business."

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Narrowly focused investments and investments focusing on a single country may be subject to higher volatility. There are additional risks associated with investing in base and precious metals as well as their respective mining industries. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds’ summary or full prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-888-GX-FUND-1 (1.888.493.8631), or by visiting www.globalxfunds.com.

Searching for Growth in Emerging Markets – Global X Funds





































Searching for Growth in Emerging Markets
Given high valuations and sluggish growth among the developed markets, many investors are looking to the emerging markets for potential returns. Yet we believe popular market capitalization-weighted emerging market indexes dilute the high-growth opportunities in the emerging markets that investors are seeking. One cause for this “dilution” is due to the fact that market cap-weighting schemes tend to overweight the countries that have already experienced periods of rapid growth and are now decelerating as they mature into middle-income economies.
For example, as of December 30, 2016, the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), South Korea, and Taiwan made up nearly 73% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index but demonstrated an average GDP growth rate of just 1.5% during that same year.1 At the inception (1988) of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the average GDP growth rates for these six countries was 8.2%. The 5-year rolling average GDP chart below shows that since the late 1980s, these countries have experienced a downward trend of economic expansion.

Source: Knoema, 2017. GDP data from 1983 to 2016. 
While traditional emerging market indexes may be overexposed to these slowing economies, it’s possible that investors could consider two alternative approaches in an effort to zero-in on the higher growth potential opportunities that remain within the emerging markets:

A broad approach that focuses on the less advanced developing markets – the next emerging and frontier countries; and
A targeted approach that isolates specific sectors within the larger emerging markets, such as the Chinese consumer and technology sectors.

A Focus on Less Developed Countries: The Next Emerging and Frontier Markets
Many investors prefer accessing a variety of emerging markets simultaneously to help mitigate the idiosyncratic risks associated with any one economy. In order to maintain broad exposure to the emerging market asset class, while increasing its growth potential, investors might consider shifting their focus away from the largest emerging markets and focus in on the less developed emerging and frontier markets. This strategy, which is the basis for the Global X Next Emerging & Frontier ETF (EMFM), avoids 6 major middle-income economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Korea, and Taiwan (‘BRIC + ST’). EMFM solely focuses on the less developed category of the ‘next’ emerging & frontier countries (‘Next EM + FM’).
The next emerging & frontier markets make up only 27% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (0% of which are frontier markets portion), but often have attractive characteristics, such as large, growing populations, vast natural resources, and low market capitalization to GDP ratios.2
The combined population in the Next EM + FM countries are the largest in the world and forecast to expand at twice as fast as the BRIC + ST countries and four times as fast as developed economies. Coupling these demographics with 37% lower labor costs than the BRIC +ST countries, it’s possible that the Next EM + FM countries could benefit from a demographic tailwind, which might accelerate their growth.

Source: Global X Research based country data from OECD, Numbeo, 2017.
While the Next EM + FM countries tend to have lower amounts of fixed assets and capital than their more developed peers, they are often rich in natural resources. Exporting these commodities to developed markets attracts foreign capital that can be used to improve public services like education and healthcare, to develop better infrastructure, and to import new technologies, for example. Over time, reinvesting this capital can help to close the economic gap between the Next EM + FM countries and the rest of the world.

Source: Global X Research based country data from UNCTAD, 2016.
The Next EM + FM countries demonstrate the lowest market cap to GDP ratio, which is a measure about which Warren Buffett once said, “(is) probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.”3 This ratio tends to move towards 100% as a country’s capital markets mature and become fully priced. Given the comparatively low market cap to GDP ratio, the capital markets in the Next EM + FM could be on a track to expand with additional IPOs and rising market caps.

Target Sector Exposures: China Consumer and Technology
Rather than entirely eliminating the BRIC + ST countries from an emerging market allocation, investors could opt to target just the higher growth segments of these economies. For example, while China’s broad economic growth is generally slowing, the country is in the midst of a substantial transition from its ‘old economy,’ characterized by often inefficient state-owned enterprises and investment in fixed-assets, to a ‘new economy’ led by domestic consumption. This transition could create a substantial opportunity within the consumer and technology sectors, which have the potential to benefit from the rising spending power of Chinese consumers/shoppers.
In 2015, household final consumption accounted for approximately 37% of China’s total GDP. This figure is well below the 54% average for similar middle-income countries (see chart). If Chinese household consumption numbers are on a path to match other similar middle income countries, consumption as a % of GDP will likely increase. 2016 demonstrated that this trend underway as retail sales expanded 9.6% during the year, exceeding the country’s total GDP growth of 6.7%.4

Source: World Bank, 2015, Trading Economics, 2017. 
The power of China’s shopping is seen in areas as varied as transportation, entertainment, cell phones, and luxury goods. Today, China is the world’s largest automobile market and has charged ahead as the biggest purchaser of electric vehicles.5 Moviegoers in China contributed 17% of total box office receipts in 2016.6 They also represent one third of global luxury retail sales, and they are making many of these purchases online.7 E-commerce purchases grew by 26% percent last year in China, as 15.5% of total retail purchases were made online.8 Part of this online retail push is attributable to China’s massive market for smartphones, which is now the largest in the world.9
Conclusion
Broad market cap-weighted exposures to the emerging markets can dilute exposures to larger potential growth opportunities. To achieve more precise exposures to these opportunities, investors could be well suited to either focus on next emerging and frontier markets or more targeted exposures within the BRIC + ST countries.
Global X offers the Global X Next Emerging & Frontier ETF (EMFM) for broad access to developing markets while excluding the BRICs, South Korea and Taiwan.  In addition, Global X offers the Global X China Consumer ETF (CHIQ) and the Global X NASDAQ China Technology ETF (QQQC) for targeted exposure to segments of the Chinese economy that potentially stand to benefit from rising spending.

Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. International investing may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuations in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles, or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Frontier markets generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. These countries are subject to potentially significant political, social and economic instability, which could materially and adversely affect the companies in which the Fund may invest. EMFM invests in securities and markets that are susceptible to fluctuations in certain commodity markets. Commodities represent a significant portion of the Latin American and Middle Eastern economies. Any negative changes in commodity markets could have a great impact on these economies. Unlike most exchange-traded funds, EMFM intends to effect all creations and redemptions partially for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in EMFM may be less tax-efficient than an investment in a more conventional ETF. 
Securities focusing on a single country and narrowly focused investments may be subject to higher volatility. Investments in securities in the Technology sector are subject to rapid changes in technology product cycles; rapid product obsolescence; government regulation; and increased competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology tend to be more volatile than the overall market, and are also heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights.

 View Chart Explanation
 Download Chart Data (.CSV)
How can the Fund trade at a premium/discount to its NAV?
The primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the NAV and the closing price of the Fund. Since shares of the Fund trade on the open market, prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors, corporations and financial institutions. Depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment, shares of the Fund may deviate slightly from the value of the Fund's underlying assets. As a result, shareholders may pay more than NAV when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices. However, due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to ETFs, market makers are able to minimize these deviations from NAV by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
What causes these time discrepancies?
Close of Trading Times. Although both the NAV and the closing trade of the Fund are generally calculated at the closing time of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies.
Time of Last Trade. Trading of Global X funds generally takes place during normal trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time). However, it is important to note that the last trade - from which the closing price is determined - may not occur at exactly 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Therefore, changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the NAV to deviate from the closing price.
International Holdings. The premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets. Because the Funds trade during U.S. market hours while the underlying securities may not, the time lapse between the markets can result in differences between the NAV and the closing price.

Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Global X NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees, expenses or sales charges. One cannot invest directly in an index.
Since the Fund’s shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund’s inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns. Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions. There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.
Carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses. This and other information can be found in the fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Global X Management Company LLC serves as an advisor to Global X Funds. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with Global X Management Company LLC. Global X Funds are not sponsored, endorsed, issued, sold or promoted by Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI nor do these companies make any representations regarding the advisability of investing in the Global X Funds. Neither SIDCO nor Global X is affiliated with Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. High yielding stocks are often speculative, high-risk investments. These companies can be paying out more than they can support and may reduce their dividends or stop paying dividends at any time, which could have a material adverse effect on the stock price of these companies and the Fund’s performance. The potential benefits of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. Further, if the MLP is deemed to be a corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distributions to the fund which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. The risks associated with real estate investment trusts including interest rate risk which may cause certain REIT holdings to decline in value if interest rates increase. REITs are subject to general risks related to real estate including default risk and the possibility of decreasing property values.
High short-term performance of the fund is unusual and investors should not expect such performance to be repeated.

 View Chart Explanation
 Download Chart Data (.CSV)
How can the Fund trade at a premium/discount to its NAV?
The primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the NAV and the closing price of the Fund. Since shares of the Fund trade on the open market, prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors, corporations and financial institutions. Depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment, shares of the Fund may deviate slightly from the value of the Fund's underlying assets. As a result, shareholders may pay more than NAV when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices. However, due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to ETFs, market makers are able to minimize these deviations from NAV by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
What causes these time discrepancies?
Close of Trading Times. Although both the NAV and the closing trade of the Fund are generally calculated at the closing time of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies.
Time of Last Trade. Trading of Global X funds generally takes place during normal trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time). However, it is important to note that the last trade - from which the closing price is determined - may not occur at exactly 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Therefore, changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the NAV to deviate from the closing price.
International Holdings. The premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets. Because the Funds trade during U.S. market hours while the underlying securities may not, the time lapse between the markets can result in differences between the NAV and the closing price.

Carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses. This and other information can be found in the fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Global X NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees, expenses or sales charges. One cannot invest directly in an index.
Since the Fund’s shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund’s inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns.
Global X Management Company LLC serves as an advisor to Global X Funds. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with Global X Management Company LLC. Global X Funds are not sponsored, endorsed, issued, sold or promoted by Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI nor do these companies make any representations regarding the advisability of investing in the Global X Funds. Neither SIDCO nor Global X is affiliated with Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Preferred stock is subject to many of the risks associated with debt securities, including interest rate risk. In addition, preferred stock may not pay a dividend, an issuer may suspend payment of dividends on preferred stock at any time, and in certain situations, an issuer may call or redeem its preferred stock or convert it to common stock. High yielding stocks are often speculative, high-risk investments. These companies can be paying out more than they can support and may reduce their dividends or stop paying dividends at any time, which could have a material adverse effect on the stock price of these companies and the Fund’s performance.
High short-term performance of the fund is unusual and investors should not expect such performance to be repeated.

Cumulative return is the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time. Annualized Return is the average return gained or lost by an investment each year over a given time period.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.

 View Chart Explanation
 Download Chart Data (.CSV)
How can the Fund trade at a premium/discount to its NAV?
The primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the NAV and the closing price of the Fund. Since shares of the Fund trade on the open market, prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors, corporations and financial institutions. Depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment, shares of the Fund may deviate slightly from the value of the Fund's underlying assets. As a result, shareholders may pay more than NAV when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices. However, due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to ETFs, market makers are able to minimize these deviations from NAV by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
What causes these time discrepancies?
Close of Trading Times. Although both the NAV and the closing trade of the Fund are generally calculated at the closing time of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies.
Time of Last Trade. Trading of Global X funds generally takes place during normal trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time). However, it is important to note that the last trade - from which the closing price is determined - may not occur at exactly 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Therefore, changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the NAV to deviate from the closing price.
International Holdings. The premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets. Because the Funds trade during U.S. market hours while the underlying securities may not, the time lapse between the markets can result in differences between the NAV and the closing price.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Narrowly focused investments and investments focusing on a single country may be subject to higher volatility. There are additional risks associated with investing in base and precious metals as well as their respective mining industries. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds’ summary or full prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-888-GX-FUND-1 (1.888.493.8631), or by visiting www.globalxfunds.com.

Global X Funds Launches Founder-Run Companies ETF






Feb 15, 2017, 10:05am EST














NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Global X Funds, the New York-based provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today launched the Global X Founder-Run Companies ETF (BATS: BOSS). Tracking the Solactive U.S. Founder-Run Companies Index, BOSS will hold a basket primarily consisting of U.S. large and mid-cap companies led by CEOs who are the original founders of their firms. The fund will be the fourth in Global X's "Alpha" suite of funds, designed with the aim of delivering market-beating returns.

The founder/CEOs of companies currently held in BOSS boast 10 times higher equity ownership in their companies than the average S&P 500 CEO.i Further, in-depth studies have concluded that founder/CEOs instill an owner's mindset in their firms, which consists of a unique set of core practices, values, and attitudes that can positively influence their company's success over the long term.ii 
"Bringing BOSS to market reinforces our goal of providing unique solutions for investors that are based on academic research and sound index construction," said Alex Ashby, director of product development at Global X. "Founders bring a unique vision and innovative culture to their companies that we believe will translate into more sustainable long-term growth." 
High equity ownership, bolstered by an emotional attachment to a company they have grown from the start, may cause founder/CEOs to take a longer term view of growing their businesses. For example, these companies tend to avoid excess indebtedness, averaging 52% lower debt-to-equity ratios than the average S&P 500 company.iii
