Lionel L. Nowell III













                    
                    Lionel L. Nowell III has worked in senior leadership positions with PepsiCo, Pillsbury, RJR Nabisco and several other Fortune 500 companies. Throughout the course of his career Mr. Nowell enhanced his personal and professional skills, and evolved into a successful business executive who has a passion for sharing knowledge and insights that will help people achieve their goals, dreams, and aspirations. Mr. Nowell's perspective on the topic of being successful, confident, and happy is routed in his personal experiences. Growing up in Columbus, Ohio Mr. Nowell faced adversity and encountered the anguish of having dreams and aspirations that were bigger than what other people thought would be possible or appropriate for him.  Yet, through his numerous trials and tribulations, Mr. Nowell ultimately discovered that you do not pursue success and happiness, you create it. Mr. Nowell is the author of two self-help books entitled “You Are Better Than Your Best'" and "Sometimes You Have To Lose To Win." Both of these books are written in a logical, concise, insightful way, and are saturated with the wisdom Mr. Nowell acquired as he traveled the path to his personal success.

Product description…
Life is Simple, People Make it Complicated
Have you ever wondered why some individuals achieve tremendous success in life, and are happy? While other people put forth great effort, and still fail to maximize their talents, or reach their full potential. Do you aspire to do better, be better, and achieve more in every aspect of your life? If so, this book is definitely for you! By reading “You Are Better Than Your Best” you will discover the knowledge, traits, and principles that are necessary to be successful and happy. In the process you will be meticulously guided through some proven techniques that will provide insights into enjoying a more complete and fulfilled life. While many books have been written, and numerous writers have expounded on the merits of self-help, I believe I am uniquely qualified to write this particular book. Among other things, like many of you I have faced adversity, I know how it feels to be languishing in life, unsure of which way to turn, what to do, or who to go to for support. I understand what desiring more than you have today feels like. And, I have experienced having dreams, and aspirations, that were bigger than what other people thought would be possible, or appropriate, for me. The truth is you do not pursue success and happiness you create it. This book describes how a successful, happy, and meaningful life is attainable by anyone who possesses the three D’s – Desire, Determination, and Dedication. Stop procrastinating, and change your ‘cannot’ attitude, into a ‘can do’ attitude. All of your dreams and aspirations are achievable. Set in motion the attributes reflected on the pages in this book, and embark on a fantastic journey that is going to totally transform your life………. “All” of the author’s proceeds from “You Are Better Than Your Best” will be used to help underprivileged kids attend college. Help us help others realize their dreams!
