Keith T. Flaherty, MD | the one hundred










 










































 














 Keith T. Flaherty, MD
Caregiver | 2011


As director of developmental therapeutics at the Mass General Cancer Center, Keith Flaherty, MD, is changing the standard of care for malignant melanoma.
Dr. Flaherty was recently recruited from the University of Pennsylvania, where he led the first successful trial of targeted therapies in melanoma, one of the most lethal human cancers. Reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010, this trial showed the efficacy of drugs that inhibit the mutant B-RAF gene in treating the many melanomas with such mutations.
Dr. Flaherty is now testing experimental therapies that could be even more effective and devising treatments that prevent cancers from acquiring resistance to such treatments.
As a clinician, Dr. Flaherty embodies the combination of compassion, therapeutic excellence and innovative research that should set the standard for physicians today.
“My wife passed away from melanoma in 2009,” writes Steven Jacobsohn. “For three years, Dr. Flaherty enabled my wife to have a relatively good quality of life. He was unique among his peers in how he looked at the reality of her disease and supported life-nurturing treatment appropriate to her illness.”

Expert Point of View: Keith T. Flaherty, MD

Keith T. Flaherty, MD


Keith T. Flaherty, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Termeer Center for Targeted Therapy, Boston, was interviewed by The ASCO Post for his thoughts on the findings from Atreya and colleagues.
He believes the study’s outcomes are sufficient for pursuing a “definitive trial” of this triplet in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer. His likely comparator would be anti-EGFR therapy, which remains a standard, though imperfect, treatment for these tumors. Outcomes with triple inhibition may be much better, he suggested.
“BRAF-mutated colon cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of colon cancer,” said Dr. Flaherty. “The data from this early-phase study are swimming up against a pretty strong current.”
‘Lineage-Specific Biology’
Asked how the triplet might be effectively tackling BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer, Dr. Flaherty explained, “What was quickly discovered in the lab is that when BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cell lines are treated with a BRAF inhibitor, signaling through EGFR would almost immediately engage and rescue the cells, both by restoring MAP kinase pathway signaling, which is where BRAF sits, but also by activating other pathways. Intriguingly, this rescue loop is available to colorectal cancer but not melanoma or other BRAF-mutated cancers,” he said.
Such observations have made clear to Dr. Flaherty that “It is not only genetic information—ie, forget about site of origin—or only site of origin that matters. It’s a mix of the two.” He refers to this as “lineage-specific biology.” He adds, “When you open the door with a single drug targeting a single vulnerability, the tumor system will tell you what is its next most important feature.”
The BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer story is a perfect example of this approach, where “we promulgate all the single-agent opportunities but then quickly try to cycle to the combinations…. We pick the genetic low-hanging fruit, but then engage the lineage-specific biology.” ■
Disclosure: Dr. Flaherty is a consultant for Roche, Novartis, and Array BioPharma.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Flaherty has no media or publications listed.Background Check n/a Malpractice Claims not availableHealthgrades does not collect malpractice information for Pennsylvania.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Flaherty's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.
