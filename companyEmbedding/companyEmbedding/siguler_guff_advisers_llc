All news →  
 













 The prolonged low interest rate environment has created enormous pressure to take greater risk in order to achieve higher returns and meet actuarial return targets. A fiduciary can most responsibly achieve target returns through active asset management and investing with strong, experienced partners.
  —   George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 A high rate of disposable income, increasing 4G and broadband penetration, and an educational system that produces over 50,000 graduates with technical degrees each year, make Russia strongly positioned to become one of the largest and most dynamic consumer Internet markets in the world.
 — Drew Guff, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 Historically, the high returns in the buyout business have come from investments that were made during a recession or in the early stages of economic recovery.
 —  George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 In the coming years, emerging markets will continue to play a major role in global economic power and private consumption shifts. The private equity asset class in emerging markets continues to show strong returns and better downside protection compared to public markets. The recent discorrelation presents an interesting entry point for experienced investors looking to increase their emerging markets exposure in an attractive pricing and currency environment.
 — Ralph Jaeger, Managing Director 



 In both the U.S. and Europe, the hangover effects from over-indulgence in the prior economic cycle – risk aversion and low conviction – are leaving pockets of inefficiency and opportunity in today's market. This circumstance is particularly pronounced in Europe, where the Euro crisis of 2012 is still fresh and the disposition of non-performing loans and bad assets from the boom era is in full swing. In both markets, a value investor in commercial real estate has to be selective, but the opportunity remains to uncover good quality assets at a low basis by taking advantage of financially distressed situations.
 — James Corl, Managing Director 



 Siguler Guff takes a highly opportunistic approach to distressed investing and tactically allocates capital across assets and strategies. In a market of waning and waxing conviction, we continue to believe in a strategy of high selectivity and patience for investors with longer-term outlooks.
 — James Gereghty, Managing Director 



 Small buyout funds target a portion of the U.S. economy that is similar in aggregate size to the middle market, generating approximately $4.6 trillion of total annual revenue and employing 22 million people. However, only $26 billion of capital was raised by small buyout funds in 2013 to target a universe of 177,000 small companies. When compared to the middle market, this represents nearly ten times as many target companies but only a small fraction of the capital raised. We believe these compelling supply-demand characteristics make the small buyout market significantly more attractive than any other segment of the buyout space. (Sources: The Market that Moves America by GE Capital and The Ohio State University, 2011; Pitchbook, 2H 2014 PE and VC Fundraising and Capital Overhang Report)
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director 



 We chose Siguler Guff as our partner due to their unparalleled experience investing in the region and long history of venture investing in the U.S.
 — Arkadiy Dobkin, Co-Founder, CEO & President of EPAM Systems 



 In our experience, small buyouts have remained inefficient and difficult for large investors to access. Providing capital to facilitate the transition of family-owned and owner-operated companies is private equity investing at its best.
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director

BNY Mellon Asset Management has acquired a 20% stake in Siguler Guff & Company, a multi-strategy private equity firm with over $8 billion in assets under management. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
Siguler Guff & Company, LLC announced that BNY Mellon Asset Management has acquired a 20% minority interest in the firm, and certain related entities. Siguler Guff is a multi-strategy private equity firm with over $8 billion in assets under management and committed capital from a blue-chip roster of approximately 400 institutional investors including endowments, foundations and corporate & public pensions.
Siguler Guff’s focused investment offerings include fund-of-funds targeting distressed security investing, emerging markets including Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC), distressed real estate and small cap buyout opportunities. Siguler Guff focuses its investments across three different business lines: Fund-of-Funds, Advisory Activities and Direct Investment Funds.
The firm was founded in 1995 and employs a team of highly experienced individuals with deep expertise in distressed investing and other specialized areas in private equity. George Siguler, one of the founding partners, was also a founding employee of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the management of Harvard University’s endowment and related financial assets. Drew Guff has a long, successful history in investing in Emerging Markets Private Equity. The firm has a value-oriented opportunistic focus dedicated exclusively to private equity investing. 





The two companies formed a strategic alliance in January 2009, when Siguler Guff engaged BNY Mellon to distribute the products and services of Siguler Guff globally. In May 2009, Siguler Guff Advisers, LLC, Siguler Guff’s registered investment advisor subsidiary, became the investment advisor of the private equity fund-of-funds previously advised by WestLB Mellon Asset Management.
“We are pleased to build on our relationship with BNY Mellon, which has served both firms well since we formed our initial strategic alliance at the beginning of this year,” said George W. Siguler, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of Siguler Guff. “The global reach of BNY Mellon will help us expand our footprint and work closely with key institutions around the world.”
“This transaction formalizes our ties with Siguler Guff and significantly adds to our ‘alpha’ capabilities,” said Ronald P. O’Hanley, President and Chief Executive Officer of BNY Mellon Asset Management. “Current market conditions have led to extraordinary demand for distressed opportunity managers, and Siguler Guff is particularly well positioned to take advantage of distressed situations and the emerging markets, which are among the most promising areas for private equity investors.”
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Siguler Guff & Company LLC is a multi-strategy private equity investment firm with over $8.0 billion of assets under management across three lines of business: fund-of-funds, advisory activities and direct investment funds. Siguler Guff serves approximately 400 institutional clients and 400 high-net-worth individuals, and the funds it manages have invested in over 200 private equity funds. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Moscow, Shanghai and a local affiliate office in Mumbai.

OVERVIEW
Siguler Guff is a multi-strategy private equity investment firm which, together with its affiliates has over $10 billion of assets under management. With 20 years of experience investing as a firm in the private markets, Siguler Guff seeks to generate strong, risk-adjusted returns by focusing opportunistically on market niches.
Siguler Guff's investment products include multi-manager funds, direct investment funds and customized separate accounts targeting specific areas of compelling opportunity. The Firm's core investment strategies include distressed and special situations, distressed real estate, small business and emerging markets. Siguler Guff's institutional investment knowledge, sector immersion approach and longstanding relationships provide access to compelling investment opportunities within each of its targeted strategies.
Founded in 1991 within PaineWebber, Siguler Guff became an independent firm in 1995. The Firm currently serves over 500 institutional clients, including corporate and public employee benefit plans, endowments, foundations, government agencies and financial institutions, and more than 600 family office and high net worth investors. Headquarted in New York, Siguler Guff maintains offices in Boston, London, Moscow, Mumbai, São Paulo and Shanghai.



OUR TEAM
Siguler Guff has grown consistently over the years to now include more than 160 employees across the globe with approximately 110 employees based in the Firm's U.S. offices and 50 employees based in the Firm's international offices. Siguler Guff's investment team consists of 60 experienced professionals.
 



INVESTMENT SERVICES
Siguler Guff's investment philosophy is focused on identifying market inefficiencies that can generate high absolute rates of return and creating efficient solutions to capture them. The Firm believes that private equity presents opportunities at discrete moments in time, and dynamically allocates its clients' capital to take advantage of those opportunities as they arise. Siguler Guff focuses opportunistically on market niches as opposed to pursuing an "indexed" approach to private equity, investing only when the Firm has high conviction that a specific market opportunity has the potential to generate top-tier returns. Siguler Guff's investment approach is active, value-oriented and driven by risk-adjusted outcomes. Each strategy is staffed independently and takes advantage of the Firm's long history as a direct investor to add value well beyond the research and selection of managers.

 The prolonged low interest rate environment has created enormous pressure to take greater risk in order to achieve higher returns and meet actuarial return targets. A fiduciary can most responsibly achieve target returns through active asset management and investing with strong, experienced partners.
  —   George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 A high rate of disposable income, increasing 4G and broadband penetration, and an educational system that produces over 50,000 graduates with technical degrees each year, make Russia strongly positioned to become one of the largest and most dynamic consumer Internet markets in the world.
 — Drew Guff, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 Historically, the high returns in the buyout business have come from investments that were made during a recession or in the early stages of economic recovery.
 —  George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 In the coming years, emerging markets will continue to play a major role in global economic power and private consumption shifts. The private equity asset class in emerging markets continues to show strong returns and better downside protection compared to public markets. The recent discorrelation presents an interesting entry point for experienced investors looking to increase their emerging markets exposure in an attractive pricing and currency environment.
 — Ralph Jaeger, Managing Director 



 In both the U.S. and Europe, the hangover effects from over-indulgence in the prior economic cycle – risk aversion and low conviction – are leaving pockets of inefficiency and opportunity in today's market. This circumstance is particularly pronounced in Europe, where the Euro crisis of 2012 is still fresh and the disposition of non-performing loans and bad assets from the boom era is in full swing. In both markets, a value investor in commercial real estate has to be selective, but the opportunity remains to uncover good quality assets at a low basis by taking advantage of financially distressed situations.
 — James Corl, Managing Director 



 Siguler Guff takes a highly opportunistic approach to distressed investing and tactically allocates capital across assets and strategies. In a market of waning and waxing conviction, we continue to believe in a strategy of high selectivity and patience for investors with longer-term outlooks.
 — James Gereghty, Managing Director 



 Small buyout funds target a portion of the U.S. economy that is similar in aggregate size to the middle market, generating approximately $4.6 trillion of total annual revenue and employing 22 million people. However, only $26 billion of capital was raised by small buyout funds in 2013 to target a universe of 177,000 small companies. When compared to the middle market, this represents nearly ten times as many target companies but only a small fraction of the capital raised. We believe these compelling supply-demand characteristics make the small buyout market significantly more attractive than any other segment of the buyout space. (Sources: The Market that Moves America by GE Capital and The Ohio State University, 2011; Pitchbook, 2H 2014 PE and VC Fundraising and Capital Overhang Report)
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director 



 We chose Siguler Guff as our partner due to their unparalleled experience investing in the region and long history of venture investing in the U.S.
 — Arkadiy Dobkin, Co-Founder, CEO & President of EPAM Systems 



 In our experience, small buyouts have remained inefficient and difficult for large investors to access. Providing capital to facilitate the transition of family-owned and owner-operated companies is private equity investing at its best.
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director
