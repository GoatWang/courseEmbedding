Fund Summary
Investment Summary

Investment Objective

Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund seeks to provide investment results that
correspond to the total return (i.e., the combination of capital changes and income)
performance of common stocks publicly traded in the United States.

Principal Investment Strategies


Normally investing at least 80% of assets in common stocks included in the Standard
& Poor's 500SM  Index (S&P 500®), which broadly represents the performance of
common stocks publicly traded in the United States.
Lending securities to earn income for the fund.

Principal Investment Risks

The fund is subject to the following principal investment risks:


Stock Market Volatility. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in
response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
Different parts of the market can react differently to these developments.
Issuer-Specific Changes. The value of an individual security or particular type of
security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently
from the value of the market as a whole.

An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

When you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you paid for them,
which means that you could lose money.

Performance

The following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in
the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the fund's performance from year
to year and compares the fund's performance to the performance of a market index and
an average of the performance of similar funds over various periods of time. Returns
(before and after taxes) are based on past results and are not an indication of future
performance.

Average Annual Returns

After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal
income tax rates, but do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Return After
Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares may be higher than other returns for
the same period due to a tax benefit of realizing a capital loss upon the sale of fund
shares. Actual after-tax returns may differ depending on your individual circumstances.
The after-tax returns shown are not relevant if you hold your shares in a retirement
account or in another tax-deferred arrangement.

market size, liquidity, and industry group representation to represent U.S. equity
performance.

Prospectus

The Lipper Funds Average reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar
objectives.

Fee Table

The following table describes the fees and expenses that are incurred when you buy,
hold, or sell shares of the fund. The annual fund operating expenses provided below for
the fund are based on historical expenses, adjusted to reflect current fees.

Shareholder fees (paid by the investor directly)




Sales charge (load) on purchases and reinvested distributions



None





Deferred sales charge (load) on redemptions

Other expenses

This example helps you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.

Let's say, hypothetically, that the fund's annual return is 5% and that your shareholder
fees and the fund's annual operating expenses are exactly as described in the fee table.
This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest
actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every
$10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of
your shares at the end of each time period indicated:

Fund Basics
Investment Details

Investment Objective

Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund seeks to provide investment results that
correspond to the total return (i.e., the combination of capital changes and income)
performance of common stocks publicly traded in the United States.

Principal Investment Strategies

Geode normally invests at least 80% of the fund's assets in common stocks included in
the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock
prices. The S&P 500 broadly represents the performance of common stocks publicly
traded in the United States. In the future, FMR may, subject to shareholders' approval
and 30 days' notice, select another index if that index is deemed more representative of
the performance of U.S. common stocks.

The fund may not always hold all of the same securities as the S&P 500. Geode may use
statistical sampling techniques to attempt to replicate the returns of the S&P 500.
Statistical sampling techniques attempt to match the investment characteristics of the
index and the fund by taking into account such factors as capitalization, industry
exposures, dividend yield, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and earnings growth.

The fund may not track the index perfectly because differences between the index and
the fund's portfolio can cause differences in performance. In addition, expenses and
transaction costs, the size and frequency of cash flows into and out of the fund, and
differences between how and when the fund and the index are valued can cause
differences in performance.

Geode may lend the fund's securities to broker-dealers or other institutions to earn
income for the fund.

In addition to the principal investment strategies discussed above, Geode may use
various techniques, such as buying and selling futures contracts, swaps, and exchange
traded funds, to increase or decrease the fund's exposure to changing security prices or
other factors that affect security values. If Geode's strategies do not work as intended,
the fund may not achieve its objective.

Description of Principal Security Types

Equity securities represent an ownership interest, or the right to acquire an ownership
interest, in an issuer. Different types of equity securities provide different voting and
dividend rights and priority in the event of the bankruptcy of the issuer. Equity
securities include common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities, and
warrants.

Principal Investment Risks

Many factors affect the fund's performance. The fund's share price changes daily based
on changes in market conditions and interest rates and in response to other economic,
political, or financial developments. The fund's reaction to these developments will be
affected by the types of securities in which the fund invests, the financial condition,
industry and economic sector, and geographic location of an issuer, and the fund's level
of investment in the securities of that issuer. When you sell your shares they may be
worth more or less than what you paid for them, which means that you could lose
money.

Prospectus

Fund Basics - continued

The following factors can significantly affect the fund's performance:

Stock Market Volatility. The value of equity securities fluctuates in response to
issuer, political, market, and economic developments. In the short term, equity prices
can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments. Different parts of the
market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these
developments. For example, large cap stocks can react differently from small cap stocks,
and "growth" stocks can react differently from "value" stocks. Issuer, political, or
economic developments can affect a single issuer, issuers within an industry or economic
sector or geographic region, or the market as a whole.

Issuer-Specific Changes. Changes in the financial condition of an issuer or
counterparty, changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a
particular type of security or issuer, and changes in general economic or political
conditions can affect a security's or instrument's value. The value of securities of
smaller, less well-known issuers can be more volatile than that of larger issuers.

In response to market, economic, political, or other conditions, Geode may temporarily
use a different investment strategy for defensive purposes. If Geode does so, different
factors could affect the fund's performance and the fund may not achieve its investment
objective.

Fundamental Investment Policies

The policy discussed below is fundamental, that is, subject to change only by
shareholder approval.

Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund seeks to provide investment results that
correspond to the total return (i.e., the combination of capital changes and income)
performance of common stocks publicly traded in the United States.

Shareholder Notice

The following policy is subject to change only upon 60 days' prior notice to
shareholders:

Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in
common stocks included in the S&P 500.

Valuing Shares

The fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open.

The fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single share. Fidelity
normally calculates the fund's NAV as of the close of business of the NYSE, normally
4:00 p.m. Eastern time. However, NAV may be calculated earlier if trading on the NYSE
is restricted or as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
fund's assets are valued as of this time for the purpose of computing the fund's NAV.

Prospectus

To the extent that the fund's assets are traded in other markets on days when the
fund is not open for business, the value of the fund's assets may be affected on those
days. In addition, trading in some of the fund's assets may not occur on days when the
fund is open for business.

The fund's assets are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations or official
closing prices. Certain short-term securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost. If
market quotations or official closing prices are not readily available or do not accurately
reflect fair value for a security or if a security's value has been materially affected by
events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is
principally traded, that security will be valued by another method that the Board of
Trustees believes accurately reflects fair value in accordance with the Board's fair value
pricing policies. For example, arbitrage opportunities may exist when trading in a
portfolio security or securities is halted and does not resume before the fund calculates
its NAV. These arbitrage opportunities may enable short-term traders to dilute the NAV of
long-term investors. Securities trading in overseas markets present time zone arbitrage
opportunities when events affecting portfolio security values occur after the close of the
overseas market but prior to the close of the U.S. market. To the extent the fund invests
in other open-end funds, the fund will calculate its NAV using the NAV of the
underlying funds in which it invests as described in the underlying funds'
prospectuses. The fund may invest in other Fidelity funds that use the same fair value
pricing policies as the fund or in Fidelity money market funds. A security's valuation
may differ depending on the method used for determining value. Fair valuation of a
fund's portfolio securities can serve to reduce arbitrage opportunities available to
short-term traders, but there is no assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent
dilution of the fund's NAV by short-term traders. While the fund has policies regarding
excessive trading, these too may not be effective to prevent short-term NAV arbitrage
trading, particularly in regard to omnibus accounts.

Frequent purchases and sales of fund shares can harm shareholders in various ways,
including reducing the returns to long-term shareholders by increasing costs to the
fund (such as brokerage commissions), disrupting portfolio management strategies,
and diluting the value of the shares of long-term shareholders in cases in which
fluctuations in markets are not fully priced into the fund's NAV. Accordingly, the Board
of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures designed to discourage excessive or
short-term trading of fund shares. However, there is the risk that the fund's policies
and procedures will prove ineffective in whole or in part to detect or prevent frequent
trading. The fund may alter its policies at any time without prior notice to
shareholders.

There is no minimum holding period and shareholders can sell their shares at any time.
Shareholders will ordinarily comply with the fund's policies regarding excessive trading
by allowing 90 days to pass after each investment before they sell or exchange from the
fund. The fund may take action if shares are held longer than 90 days if the trading is
disruptive for other reasons such as unusually large trade size. The fund reserves the
right, but does not have the obligation, to reject any purchase or exchange transaction
at any time. In addition, the fund reserves the right to impose restrictions on purchases
or exchanges at any time or conditions that are more restrictive on disruptive, excessive,
or short-term trading than those that are otherwise stated in this prospectus.

Excessive trading activity is measured by the number of roundtrip transactions in a
shareholder's account. A roundtrip transaction occurs when a shareholder buys and
then sells shares of a fund within 30 days. Shareholders are limited to two roundtrip
transactions per fund within any rolling 90-day period, subject to an overall limit of four
roundtrip transactions across all Fidelity funds over a rolling 12-month period.
Transactions of $1,000 or less, systematic withdrawal and/or contribution programs,
mandatory retirement distributions, and transactions initiated by a plan sponsor will not
count toward the roundtrip limits. For employer-sponsored retirement plans, only
participant directed exchanges will count toward the roundtrip limits.

Prospectus

Shareholders with two or more roundtrip transactions in a single fund within a rolling
90-day period will be blocked from making additional purchases or exchange purchases
of the fund for 85 days. Shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions across all
Fidelity funds within any rolling 12-month period will be blocked for 85 days from
additional purchases or exchange purchases across all Fidelity funds. Any roundtrip
within 12 months of the expiration of a multi-fund block will initiate another
multi-fund block for an 85-day period. For repeat offenders, FMR may, but does not
have the obligation to, impose long-term or permanent blocks on purchase or exchange
purchase transactions in any account under the shareholder's common control at any
time, other than a participant's account held through an employer-sponsored retirement
plan. Employer-sponsored retirement plan participants whose activity triggers a purchase
or exchange block will be permitted one trade every calendar quarter. In the event of a
block, employer and participant contributions and loan repayments by the participant
may still be invested in the fund.

Qualified wrap programs will be monitored by matching the adviser's orders for
purchase, exchange, or sale transactions in fund shares to determine if the adviser's
orders comply with the fund's frequent trading policies. Additions to and withdrawals
from a qualified wrap program by the adviser's client will not be matched with
transactions initiated by the adviser. Therefore if the adviser buys shares of a fund
and an individual client subsequently sells shares of the same fund within 30 days, the
client's transaction is not matched with the adviser's and therefore does not count as a
roundtrip. However, client initiated transactions are subject to the fund's policies on
frequent trading and individual clients will be subject to restrictions due to their
frequent trading in a wrap account. Excessive trading by an adviser will lead to fund
blocks and the wrap program will cease to be a qualified wrap program. If the wrap
program is blocked from making additional purchases or exchange purchases of a fund
because of excessive trading by the adviser the wrap program will no longer be
considered qualified and any transaction whether initiated by the adviser or the client
will be matched when counting roundtrips. Commencing no later than March 31, 2005,
wrap account client purchases and sale transactions will be monitored under the fund's
monitoring policy as though the wrap clients were fund shareholders. A qualified wrap
program is: i) a program whose adviser certifies that it has investment discretion over
$100 million or more in client assets invested in mutual funds at the time of the
certification, ii) a program in which the adviser directs transactions in the accounts
participating in the program in concert with changes in a model portfolio, and iii)
managed by an adviser who agrees to give FMR sufficient information to permit FMR to
identify the individual accounts in the wrap program.

The fund's excessive trade monitoring policy described above does not apply to
transactions initiated by the trustee or adviser to a donor-advised charitable gift
fund, qualified fund-of-fund(s) or other strategy funds, or omnibus accounts.
Trustees or advisers of donor-advised charitable gift funds must certify to the fund's
satisfaction that they either work from an asset allocation model or direct
transactions in their accounts in concert with changes in a model portfolio and that
participants are limited in their ability to influence investments by the trust. A
qualified fund-of-fund(s) is a mutual fund, qualified tuition program, or other
strategy fund consisting of qualified plan assets that either applies the Fidelity fund's
policies on frequent trading to shareholders at the fund-of-fund(s) level, or
demonstrates that the fund-of-fund(s) has policies designed to control frequent
trading and that they are reasonably likely to be effective as determined by the
Fidelity fund's Treasurer. The adviser to the fund-of-fund(s) must also demonstrate
to the Fidelity fund's Treasurer that its investment strategy will not lead to excessive
trading. Strategy funds must commence monitoring for excessive trading no later
than March 31, 2005. Omnibus accounts are maintained by intermediaries acting on
behalf of multiple investors whose individual trades are not ordinarily disclosed to
the fund. Short-term trading by these investors is likely to go undetected by the fund
and may increase costs and disrupt portfolio management. The fund will monitor
aggregate trading in qualified fund-of-funds and known omnibus accounts to attempt
to identify disruptive trades, focusing on transactions in excess of $250,000. There is
no assurance that these policies will be effective, or will successfully detect or deter
market timing.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information - continued

The fund's Treasurer is authorized to suspend the fund's policies during periods of
severe market turbulence or national emergency. The actions of the Treasurer are
periodically reviewed with the Board of Trustees.

The fund does not knowingly accommodate frequent purchases and redemptions of
fund shares by investors, except as provided under the fund's policies with respect to
known omnibus accounts, qualified fund-of-fund(s), qualified wrap accounts,
donor-advised charitable gift funds, and 30 day roundtrips.

Buying Shares

The price to buy one share of the fund is the fund's NAV. The fund's shares are sold
without a sales charge.

Your shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in
proper form.

The fund may reject for any reason, or cancel as permitted or required by law, any
purchase orders, including exchanges.

For example, the fund may reject any purchase orders, including exchanges, from
market timers or investors that, in FMR's opinion, may be disruptive to the fund.

The fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares only on a limited
basis, for a period of time or permanently.

Prospectus

When you place an order to buy shares, note the following:


All of your purchases must be made in U.S. dollars and checks must be drawn on U.S.

at least $50.

for any losses or fees the fund or Fidelity has incurred.
Under applicable anti-money laundering regulations and other federal regulations,
purchase orders may be suspended, restricted, or canceled and the monies may be
withheld.

Shares of the fund may be bought in exchange for securities you hold that meet the
fund's investment objective, policies, and limitations. Fidelity may refuse a securities
exchange for any reason. You may realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes
upon a securities exchange. For further information, call Fidelity at the appropriate

Selling Shares 

The price to sell one share of the fund is the fund's NAV.

Your shares will be sold at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper
form. Normally, redemptions will be processed by the next business day, but it may
take up to seven days to pay the redemption proceeds if making immediate payment
would adversely affect the fund.

Certain requests must include a signature guarantee. It is designed to protect you and
Fidelity from fraud. Your request must be made in writing and include a signature
guarantee if any of the following situations apply:


You wish to sell more than $100,000 worth of shares;
The address on your account (record address) has changed within the last 15 or 30
days, depending on your account, and you wish to sell $10,000 or more of shares;
You are requesting that a check be mailed to a different address than the record
address;
You are requesting that redemption proceeds be paid to someone other than the
account owner; or
The redemption proceeds are being transferred to a Fidelity account with a different
registration.

You should be able to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank, broker, dealer, credit
union (if authorized under state law), securities exchange or association, clearing
agency, or savings association. A notary public cannot provide a signature guarantee.

When you place an order to sell shares, note the following:


If you are selling some but not all of your shares, leave at least $100,000 worth of
shares in the account to keep it open ($2,000 for fund balances in Fidelity Rollover
IRAs and $500 for fund balances in Fidelity Keogh accounts), except accounts not
subject to account minimums.
Redemption proceeds (other than exchanges) may be delayed until money from prior
purchases sufficient to cover your redemption has been received and collected. This
can take up to seven business days after a purchase.

Prospectus


Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is
closed (other than weekends or holidays), when trading on the NYSE is restricted, or
as permitted by the SEC.
Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather than in cash
if FMR determines it is in the best interests of the fund.
You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed redemption checks.
Unless otherwise instructed, Fidelity will send a check to the record address.
Under applicable anti-money laundering regulations and other federal regulations,
redemption requests may be suspended, restricted, canceled, or processed and the
proceeds may be withheld.

Exchanging Shares

An exchange involves the redemption of all or a portion of the shares of one fund and
the purchase of shares of another fund.

As a shareholder you have the privilege of exchanging shares of the fund for shares of
other Fidelity funds.

However, you should note the following policies and restrictions governing exchanges:


The exchange limit may be modified for accounts held by certain institutional
retirement plans to conform to plan exchange limits and Department of Labor
regulations. See your retirement plan materials for further information.
The fund may refuse any exchange purchase for any reason. For example, the fund
may refuse exchange purchases by any person or group if, in FMR's judgment, the fund
would be unable to invest the money effectively in accordance with its investment
objective and policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected.
Before exchanging into a fund, read its prospectus.
The fund you are exchanging into must be available for sale in your state.
Exchanges may have tax consequences for you.
If you are exchanging between accounts that are not registered in the same name,
address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), there may be additional
requirements.
Under applicable anti-money laundering regulations and other federal regulations,
exchange requests may be suspended, restricted, canceled, or processed and the
proceeds may be withheld.

The fund may terminate or modify the exchange privilege in the future.

Other funds may have different exchange restrictions, and may impose trading fees of up
to 2.00% of the amount exchanged. Check each fund's prospectus for details.

Monthly or quarterly account statements (detailing account balances and all
transactions completed during the prior month or quarter).
Financial reports (every six months).

To reduce expenses, only one copy of most financial reports and prospectuses may be

prospectuses. If you do not want the mailing of these documents to be combined with
those for other members of your household, contact Fidelity in writing at P.O. Box
770001, Cincinnati, Ohio 45277-0002.

You may initiate many transactions by telephone or electronically. Fidelity will
not be responsible for any loss, cost, expense, or other liability resulting from
unauthorized transactions if it follows reasonable security procedures designed to
verify the identity of the investor. Fidelity will request personalized security codes or
other information, and may also record calls. For transactions conducted through the
Internet, Fidelity recommends the use of an Internet browser with 128-bit encryption.
You should verify the accuracy of your confirmation statements upon receipt and notify
Fidelity immediately of any discrepancies in your account activity. If you do not want
the ability to sell and exchange by telephone, call Fidelity for instructions. Additional
documentation may be required from corporations, associations, and certain
fiduciaries.

Prospectus

When you sign your account application, you will be asked to certify that your social
security or taxpayer identification number (TIN) is correct and that you are not
subject to backup withholding for failing to report income to the IRS. If you violate IRS
regulations, the IRS can require the fund to withhold an amount subject to the
applicable backup withholding rate from your taxable distributions and redemptions.

You may also be asked to provide additional information in order for Fidelity to verify
your identity in accordance with requirements under anti-money laundering
regulations. Accounts may be restricted and/or closed, and the monies withheld,
pending verification of this information or as otherwise required under these and other
federal regulations.

If your account balance falls below $100,000 ($2,000 for fund balances in Fidelity
Rollover IRAs and $500 for fund balances in Fidelity Keogh accounts) for any reason,
including solely due to declines in NAV, you will be given 30 days' notice to reestablish
the minimum balance. If you do not increase your balance, Fidelity may close your
account and send the proceeds to you. Your shares will be sold at the NAV on the day
your account is closed. Accounts not subject to account minimums will not be closed
for failure to maintain a minimum balance.

Fidelity may charge a fee for certain services, such as providing historical account
documents.

Dividends and Capital Gain Distributions

The fund earns dividends, interest, and other income from its investments, and
distributes this income (less expenses) to shareholders as dividends. The fund also
realizes capital gains from its investments, and distributes these gains (less any losses)
to shareholders as capital gain distributions.

The fund normally pays dividends in April, July, October, and December and pays
capital gain distributions in April and December.

Distribution Options

When you open an account, specify on your application how you want to receive your
distributions. The following distribution options are available for the fund:

1. Reinvestment Option. Your dividends and capital gain distributions will be
automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund. If you do not indicate a
choice on your application, you will be assigned this option.

2. Income-Earned Option. Your capital gain distributions will be automatically
reinvested in additional shares of the fund. Your dividends will be paid in cash.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information - continued

3. Cash Option. Your dividends and capital gain distributions will be paid in cash.

Not all distribution options are available for every account. If the option you prefer is
not listed on your account application, or if you want to change your current option,
call Fidelity.

If you elect to receive distributions paid in cash by check and the U.S. Postal Service
does not deliver your checks, your distribution option may be converted to the
Reinvestment Option. You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed
distribution checks.

Tax Consequences

As with any investment, your investment in the fund could have tax consequences for
you. If you are not investing through a tax-advantaged retirement account, you should
consider these tax consequences.

Taxes on distributions. Distributions you receive from the fund are subject to federal
income tax, and may also be subject to state or local taxes.

For federal tax purposes, certain of the fund's distributions, including dividends and
distributions of short-term capital gains, are taxable to you as ordinary income, while
certain of the fund's distributions, including distributions of long-term capital gains, are
taxable to you generally as capital gains. A percentage of certain distributions of
dividends may qualify for taxation at long-term capital gains rates (provided certain
holding period requirements are met).

If you buy shares when a fund has realized but not yet distributed income or capital
gains, you will be "buying a dividend" by paying the full price for the shares and then
receiving a portion of the price back in the form of a taxable distribution.

Any taxable distributions you receive from the fund will normally be taxable to you
when you receive them, regardless of your distribution option.

Taxes on transactions. Your redemptions, including exchanges, may result in a
capital gain or loss for federal tax purposes. A capital gain or loss on your investment in
the fund generally is the difference between the cost of your shares and the price you
receive when you sell them.

A Total returns would have been lower had certain expenses not been reduced during the periods shown.

B Calculated based on average shares outstanding during the period.

C Investment income per share reflects a special dividend which amounted to $.12 per share. Excluding the special dividend, the ratio of net
investment income to average net assets would have been 1.61%.

D Expense ratios reflect operating expenses of the fund. Expenses before reductions do not reflect amounts reimbursed by the investment adviser or
reductions from brokerage service arrangements or other expense offset arrangements and do not represent the amount paid by the fund during
periods when reimbursements or reductions occur. Expenses net of any voluntary waivers reflect expenses after reimbursement by the investment
adviser but prior to reductions from brokerage service arrangements or other expense offset arrangements. Expenses net of all reductions represent the
net expenses paid by the fund.

E For the year ended February 29.

PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate historical performance. You can look at      
the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change,     
or the growth of a hypothetical $100,000 investment. Total return reflects      
the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of dividend     
income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities        
that have grown in value). If Fidelity had not reimbursed certain fund          
expenses, the total returns would have been lower.

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms        
over a set period - in this case, one year, five years, or since the fund       
started on February 17, 1988. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a      
fund that had a 5% return over the past year, you would have $1,050. For        
comparison, you can look at the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500        
Index - a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stocks. To measure       
how the fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it     
to the S&P 500 index objective funds average, which reflects the                
performance of 53 mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper        
Analytical Services, Inc. over the past one year. Both benchmarks reflect       
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect     
of sales charges.

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS take the fund's cumulative return and show you     
what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each      
year. (Note: Lipper calculates average annual total returns by annualizing      
each fund's total return, then taking an arithmetic average. This may           
produce a slightly different figure than that obtained by averaging the         
cumulative total returns and annualizing the result.)

$100,000 OVER LIFE OF FUND:  Let's say hypothetically that $100,000 was         
invested in Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund on February 17, 1988, when the       
fund started. As the chart shows, by February 28, 1997, the value of the        
investment would have grown to $389,861 - a 289.86% increase on the initial     
investment. For comparison, look at how the S&P 500 did over the same           
period. With dividends and capital gains, if any, reinvested, the same          
$100,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to $399,788 - a 299.79%     
increase.                                                                       
UNDERSTANDING                                                                   
PERFORMANCE                                                                     
How a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of                                     
how it will do tomorrow. The stock market, for                                  
example, has a history of growth in the long                                    
run and volatility in the short run. In turn, the                               
share price and return of a fund that invests                                   
in stocks or bonds will vary. That means if you                                 
sell your shares during a market downturn, you                                  
might lose money. But if you can ride out the                                   
market's ups and downs, you may have a gain.

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW                                               

An interview with                                                               
Jennifer Farrelly,                                                              
Portfolio Manager                                                               
of Spartan U.S.                                                                 
Equity Index Fund                                                               
(formerly Fidelity                                                              
U.S. Equity Index                                                               
Portfolio)                                                                      
Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM, JENNIFER?                                          
A. For the 12-month period that ended February 28, 1997, the fund had a         
total return of 25.87%. That compares with the 26.16% return of the             
Standard & Poor's 500 Index for the same period. Of course, the fund's          
total return is slightly lower than the index due to expenses.                  
Additionally, the S&P 500 index objective funds average, as tracked by          
Lipper Analytical Services, returned 25.56% for the 12-month period.            
Q. WHAT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET RECENTLY?        
A. Throughout the past 12 months, the market has been able to shake off         
brief downturns and rebound strongly. For example, in early December 1996,      
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan caused markets to tumble          
worldwide when he hinted at the "irrational exuberance" of the stock            
market. However, sentiment toward stocks remained optimistic because the        
economy posted slow but steady growth with relatively low inflation. For        
most of the period, investors took heart that the economy wasn't growing so     
fast that it might spawn a rise in interest rates that could erode              
corporate profits. At the end of February, however, Greenspan noted in his      
semiannual Congressional testimony that the Fed might be inclined to raise      
short-term interest rates modestly in the first half of 1997, as a              
preemptive strike against possible inflation caused by a tight labor            
market.                                                                         
Q. IN SUCH A STRONG MARKET, EARNINGS REPORTS MUST HAVE BEEN SOLID . . .         
A. Yes, they were. In 1996, both third quarter and fourth quarter earnings      
came in stronger than expected. Nevertheless, there were some concerns that     
corporate earnings might begin                                                  
to show some weakness. For one thing, the dollar remained strong, raising       
the costs of American goods abroad. For another, a tight labor market           
raised the potential for increased wages and lower profits. Presently,          
companies have very little pricing power, making it very difficult for them     
to pass on higher employment costs in the form of price increases.              
Q. LARGE-CAPITALIZATION STOCKS CONTINUED TO BE THE MARKET LEADERS. WHY IS       
THAT?                                                                           
A. What we've witnessed this year is what investors call a "flight to           
quality," where large-capitalization companies are sought because of their      
stable earnings growth and liquidity. As the market climbs higher and           
higher, it becomes more difficult for portfolio managers to pick stocks         
that will outperform. Therefore, many managers have moved to larger             
companies with established track records as a way of keeping up with the        
market. Some large-cap stocks also are considered "defensive," because they     
are not influenced by the vagaries of the economy. In the past few months,      
investors sought defensive stocks - such as food or personal care companies     
- because they offer steady earnings growth in an environment where it can      
be difficult to discern the strength of the economy.                            
Q. TECHNOLOGY PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE MARKET LEADERS. WHY WAS THAT?             
A. Among the many factors that drove this sector was stronger-than-expected     
personal computer sales - up 20% in 1996 from 1995. This demand buoyed many     
companies with PC-related products. For example, memory chip maker Intel        
posted very strong earnings gains. Microsoft also continued its dominance       
of the software business. In February 1997, however, the technology sector      
faltered, largely because the group's valuations were very high and some        
companies reported earnings slowdowns. For example, the distribution            
channels that sell personal computers - a leading indicator of technology       
demand - reported mediocre results.                                             
Q. FINANCIAL COMPANIES ALSO PERFORMED WELL . . .                                
A. Yes, they did. Bank stocks thrived, helped by steadily improving             
earnings, strong balance sheets and a greater emphasis on fee-based             
businesses. Additionally, banks enjoyed a relatively benign interest rate       
environment. Brokerage firms also continued to reap the rewards of a            
booming stock market.                                                           
Q. WHAT WERE THE MAIN DRIVERS BEHIND THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF ENERGY           
STOCKS?                                                                         
A. The price of the underlying commodities - oil and natural gas - shot up      
in 1996 due to a positive supply and demand dynamic, and the stocks             
followed suit. However, since the beginning of 1997, the price of oil has       
dropped about 20%, and energy-related stocks have suffered.                     
Q. WERE THERE ANY SECTORS THAT PROVED TO BE LAGGARDS?                           
A. Utility stocks struggled. The sector underperformed the broad market due     
to concerns about how deregulation would affect utility companies,              
especially telephone and electric companies. Also, utility stocks tend to       
trade up and down with bonds, and the bond market underperformed the stock      
market significantly. The one positive area of the sector was natural gas,      
which benefited from the higher energy prices I just described.                 
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK?                                                         
A. One major wild card is the effect of possible Fed interest rate              
increases and their influence on corporate earnings. In addition, investors     
should understand there is still a great deal of uncertainty given the          
stock market's historically high valuations and the questionable                
sustainability of future corporate earnings growth.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
On April 17, 1997, the Board of Trustees approved a change in the fund's        
name from Fidelity U.S. Equity Index Portfolio to Spartan U.S. Equity Index     
Fund. Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity           
Concord Street Trust (the trust) (formerly Fidelity Institutional Trust)        
and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares. The trust is          
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940       
Act), as an open-end management investment company organized as a               
Massachusetts business trust. The financial statements have been prepared       
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which permit        
management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the         
financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting       
policies of the fund:                                                           
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are readily        
available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale price, at the        
closing bid price. Securities for which exchange quotations are not readily     
available (and in certain cases debt securities which trade on an exchange)     
are valued primarily using dealer-supplied valuations or at their fair          
value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures         
under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees. Short-term              
securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which            
quotations are not readily available are valued at amortized cost or            
original cost plus accrued interest, both of which approximate current          
value.                                                                          
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and          
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period end. Income receipts      
and expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing         
exchange rate on the respective dates of the transactions. Purchases and        
sales of securities are translated into U.S. dollars at the contractual         
currency exchange rates established at the time of each trade.                  
Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent        
net gains and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency              
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, and the difference between        
the amount of net investment income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount          
actually received. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange          
rates on investments in securities are included with the net realized and       
unrealized gain or loss on investment securities.                               
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to      
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for      
its fiscal year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding     
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."                        
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date,         
except certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date     
may have passed, are recorded as soon as the fund is informed of the            
ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any,       
are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest      
income, which includes accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as      
earned. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where       
recovery of such taxes is uncertain.                                            
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.      
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the        
funds in the trust.                                                             
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date.                                                               
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles. These differences, which may result in distribution                 
reclassifications, are primarily due to differing treatments for futures        
and options transactions, redemptions-in-kind and losses deferred due to        
wash sales. The fund also utilized earnings and profits distributed to          
shareholders on redemption of shares as a part of the dividends paid            
deduction for income tax purposes.                                              
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                  
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS - CONTINUED                                       
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.              
Undistributed net investment income and accumulated undistributed net           
realized gain (loss) on investments and foreign currency transactions may       
include temporary book and tax basis differences which will reverse in a        
subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end      
is distributed in the following year.                                           
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS. The fund generally uses foreign currency            
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated securities.         
Losses may arise from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if        
the counterparties do not perform under the contracts' terms. The U.S.          
dollar value of foreign currency contracts is determined using contractual      
currency exchange rates established at the time of each trade. The cost of      
the foreign currency contracts is included in the cost basis of the             
associated investment.                                                          
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the fund, along with other        
affiliated entities of Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR), may        
transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more joint trading accounts.      
These balances are invested in one or more repurchase agreements for U.S.       
Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                                         
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency           
Securities are transferred to an account of the fund, or to the Joint           
Trading Account, at a bank custodian. The securities are marked-to-market       
daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the principal amount of       
the repurchase agreement (including accrued interest). FMR, the fund's          
investment adviser, is responsible for determining that the value of the        
underlying securities remains in accordance with the market value               
requirements stated above.                                                      
TAXABLE CENTRAL CASH FUND. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the         
SEC, the fund may invest in the Taxable Central Cash Fund (the Cash Fund)       
managed by FMR Texas, an affiliate of FMR. The Cash Fund is an open-end         
money market fund available only to investment companies and other accounts     
managed by FMR and its affiliates. The Cash Fund seeks preservation of          
capital, liquidity, and current income by investing in U.S. Treasury            
securities and repurchase agreements for these securities, and may be           
utilized by the fund as an additional cash management option. Dividends         
from the Cash Fund are declared daily and paid monthly from net interest        
income. Income distributions received by the fund are recorded as interest      
income.                                                                         
FUTURES CONTRACTS. The fund may use futures contracts to manage its             
exposure to the stock market. Buying futures tends to increase the fund's       
exposure to the underlying instrument, while selling futures tends to           
decrease the fund's exposure to the underlying instrument or hedge other        
fund investments. Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees, risk of        
loss in excess of the futures variation margin reflected in the Statement       
of Assets and Liabilities. The underlying face amount at value of any open      
futures contracts at period end is shown in the schedule of investments         
under the caption "Futures Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's     
exposure to the underlying instrument at period end. Losses may arise from      
changes in the value of the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid     
secondary market for the contracts, or if the counterparties do not perform     
under the contracts' terms. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement      
price established each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they      
are traded.                                                                     
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                          
Purchases of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated           
$1,410,096,000. Sales of securities, other than short-term securities,          
aggregated $151,437,000, of which $74,038,000 represents the current value

The market value of futures contracts opened and closed during the period       
amounted to $2,309,258,000 and $2,309,333,000, respectively.                    
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR receives a fee that       
is computed daily at an annual rate of .28% of the fund's average net           
assets.                                                                         
TRANSFER AGENT FEES. Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company,     
Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of FMR, is the fund's transfer, dividend             
disbursing and shareholder servicing agent. FIIOC receives account fees and     
asset-based fees that vary according to account size and type of account.       
FIIOC pays for typesetting, printing and mailing of all shareholder             
reports, except proxy statements. For the period, the transfer agent fees       
were equivalent to an annual rate of .23% of average net assets.                
ACCOUNTING AND SECURITY LENDING FEES. Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC),     
an affiliate of FMR, maintains the fund's accounting records and                
administers the security lending program. The security lending fee is based     
on the number and duration of lending transactions. The accounting fee is       
based on the level of average net assets for the month plus out-of-pocket       
expenses.                                                                       
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. The fund placed a portion of its portfolio               
transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of FMR. The              
commissions paid to these affiliated firms were $4,000 for the period.          
5. SECURITY LENDING.                                                            
The fund loaned securities to certain brokers who paid the fund negotiated      
lenders' fees. These fees are included in interest income. The fund             
receives U.S. Treasury obligations and/or cash as collateral against the        
loaned securities, in an amount at least equal to 102% of the market value      
of the loaned securities at the inception of each loan. This collateral         
must be maintained at not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned      
securities during the period of the loan. At period end, the value of the       
securities loaned and the value of collateral amounted to $14,923,000 and       
$15,691,000, respectively.                                                      
6. BANK BORROWINGS.                                                             
The fund is permitted to have bank borrowings for temporary or emergency        
purposes to fund shareholder redemptions. The fund has established              
borrowing arrangements with certain banks. Under the most restrictive           
arrangement, the fund must pledge to the bank securities having a market        
value in excess of 220% of the total bank borrowings. The interest rate on      
the borrowings is the bank's base rate, as revised from time to time. The       
maximum loan and the average daily loan balance during the period for which     
the loan was outstanding amounted to $7,192,000. The weighted average           
interest rate was 5.69%.                                                        
7. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
FMR voluntarily agreed to reimburse the fund's operating expenses               
(excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and extraordinary             
expenses) above an annual rate of .28% of average net assets. For the           
period, the reimbursement reduced the expenses by $13,759,000. Effective        
April 18, 1997, the fund's expense limitation was changed from .28% to .19%     
of average net assets.                                                          
In addition, the fund has entered into arrangements with its custodian and      
transfer agent whereby interest earned on uninvested cash balances was used     
to offset a portion of the fund's expenses. During the period, the fund's       
custodian and transfer agent fees were reduced by $16,000 and $580,000,         
respectively, under these arrangements.                                         
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

To the Trustees of Fidelity Concord Street Trust (formerly Fidelity             
Institutional Trust) and the Shareholders of Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund     
(formerly Fidelity U.S. Equity Index Portfolio):                                
In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of            
operations and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights            
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Spartan     
U.S. Equity Index Fund (formerly Fidelity U.S. Equity Index Portfolio) (a       
fund of Fidelity Concord Street Trust) (formerly Fidelity Institutional         
Trust) at February 28, 1997, the results of its operations for the year         
then ended, and the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights      
for the periods indicated in conformity with generally accepted accounting      
principles. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter      
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the            
Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund's management; our responsibility is to           
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We        
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with           
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and            
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the              
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and       
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall            
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which             
included confirmation of securities at February 28, 1997 by correspondence      
with the custodian and brokers and the application of alternative auditing      
procedures where confirmations from brokers were not received, provide a        
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

The Board of Trustees of Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund (formerly Fidelity      
U.S. Equity Index Portfolio) voted to pay on April 7, 1997, to shareholders     
of record at the opening of business on April 4, 1997, a distribution of        
$.10 per share derived from capital gains realized from sales of portfolio      
securities.                                                                     
A total of 83.92% of the dividends distributed during the fiscal year           
qualifies for the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders.      
A total of .53% of the dividends distributed during the fiscal year was         
derived from interest on U.S. Government securities which is generally          
exempt from state income tax.                                                   
The fund will notify shareholders in January 1998 of the applicable             
percentage for use in preparing 1997 income tax returns.

PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate historical performance. You can look at      
the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change,     
or the growth of a hypothetical $100,000 investment. Total return reflects      
the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of dividend     
income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities        
that have grown in value). You can also look at the fund's income, as           
reflected in the fund's yield, to measure performance. If Fidelity had not      
reimbursed certain fund expenses, the total returns and dividends would         
have been lower.

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms        
over a set period - in this case, one year, five years, or since the fund       
started on March 8, 1990. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund         
that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment would     
be $1,050. You can compare the fund's returns to the performance of the         
Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index - a market value weighted performance      
benchmark for investment-grade fixed-rate debt issues, including                
government, corporate, asset-backed, and mortgage-backed securities, with       
maturities of at least one year. To measure how the fund's performance          
stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the intermediate U.S.       
government funds average, which reflects the performance of 120 mutual          
funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc.       
over the past one year. Both benchmarks include reinvested dividends and        
capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS take the fund's cumulative return and show you     
what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each      
year. (Note: Lipper calculates average annual total returns by annualizing      
each fund's total return, then taking an arithmetic average. This may           
produce a slightly different figure than that obtained by averaging the         
cumulative total returns and annualizing the result.)

$100,000 OVER LIFE OF FUND:  Let's say hypothetically that $100,000 was         
invested in Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund on March 31, 1990, shortly after      
the fund started. As the chart shows, by February 28, 1997, the value of        
the investment would have grown to $181,078 - an 81.08% increase on the         
initial investment. For comparison, look at how the Lehman Brothers             
Aggregate Bond Index did over the same period. With dividends and capital       
gains, if any, reinvested, the same $100,000 would have grown to $180,005 -     
an 80.01% increase.                                                             
UNDERSTANDING                                                                   
PERFORMANCE                                                                     
How a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of                                     
how it will do tomorrow. Bond prices, for                                       
example, generally move in the opposite                                         
direction of interest rates. In turn, the share                                 
price, return, and yield of a fund that invests in                              
bonds will vary. That means if you sell your                                    
shares during a market downturn, you might                                      
lose money. But if you can ride out the market's                                
ups and downs, you may have a gain.

DIVIDENDS per share show the income paid by the fund for a set period and       
do not reflect any tax reclassifications. If you annualize this number,         
based on an average net asset value of $10.56 over the past one month,          
$10.54 over the past six months and $10.49 over the past one year, you can      
compare the fund's income over these three periods. The 30-day annualized       
YIELD is a standard formula for all bond funds based on the yields of the       
bonds in the fund, averaged over the past 30 days. This figure shows you        
the yield characteristics of the fund's investments at the end of the           
period. It also helps you compare funds from different companies on an          
equal basis. If Fidelity had not reimbursed certain fund expenses during        
the period shown, the yield would have been 6.22%.

Q. CHRISTINE, HOW HAS THE FUND PERFORMED?                                       
A. Even though the fixed-income markets were volatile throughout the year,      
the fund's performance closely tracked the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond       
Index just as it is designed to do. For the year ending February 28, 1997,      
the fund's total return was 4.93%, and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond       
Index returned 5.35%. The fund's total return is slightly lower than the        
index due to operating expenses. For another comparison, the intermediate

Q. HOW DID INDIVIDUAL SECTORS OF THE TAXABLE BOND MARKET FARE?                  
A. Throughout the past year, the non-government sectors - including             
mortgage-backed, asset-backed and corporate securities - were the best          
performers. Their performance was driven by tightening yield spreads -          
which means that the difference in yields between Treasury securities and       
other sectors of the market became quite narrow. That tightening reflected      
a consistent increase in demand for higher-yielding securities together         
with moderate new issue activity.                                               
Q. TURNING TO THE FUND, WHAT ACCOUNTED FOR ITS PERFORMANCE?                     
A. Individual security selection helped the fund somewhat offset expenses       
and transaction costs, and perform closely in line with the index. Since        
the index is made up of more than 4,000 individual securities, it's             
impractical for the fund to own everything in it. In choosing the fund's        
investments, I use a technique known as statistical sampling. This process      
entails assembling a portfolio that replicates the characteristics of the       
index - which can include duration, sector, maturity, credit quality and        
others - by investing in representative issues.                                 
Q. LET'S BEGIN WITH YOUR CHOICES IN THE MORTGAGE SECTOR . . .                   
A. Mortgage-backed securities typically are very sensitive to changes in        
interest rates because they are subject to prepayment risk - the risk that      
mortgage holders will refinance or pay off their mortgages before maturity.     
Even though interest rates fluctuated throughout the year, they remained in     
a broad range, never falling low enough to trigger a large new wave of          
mortgage refinancing activity. In this environment, I focused on current        
coupon mortgages - those issued at or near current interest rates - because     
I felt that they were attractively priced relative to other mortgage            
securities. Even though current coupon bonds are highly sensitive to            
falling interest rates, this strategy benefited the fund because prepayment     
trends turned out to be close to market expectations. By the end of the         
period, the fund's mortgage holdings were fairly evenly distributed among       
various coupon mortgages replicating the Aggregate Bond index's                 
composition.                                                                    
Q. WHAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY WITHIN THE CORPORATE SECTOR?                          
A. I increased the fund's holdings in Yankee bonds, which are                   
dollar-denominated bonds issued in the United States by foreign banks,          
corporations and governments, and maintained a modest overweighting in bank     
securities relative to the index. Yankee bonds make up one of the fastest       
growing sectors of the fixed-income markets and, during the year, the           
sector offered many attractive opportunities. Since some investors don't        
invest in foreign issues, these securities often offer higher yields. I         
underweighted bonds issued by industrial concerns including manufacturing       
and consumer product companies. My continued emphasis on banks was a plus       
for the fund, as many banks' capitalization, profitability and asset            
quality improved or remained strong. What's more, mergers and acquisitions      
within the banking sector continued and many banks involved emerged as          
stronger entities.                                                              
Q. WITH INTEREST RATES VOLATILE, DID YOU EMPHASIZE THE SHORTER-MATURITY         
TREASURY SECURITIES SINCE THEY ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE MOVES?       
A. No, I didn't. It is important to remember that the fund does not make        
interest rate timing bets. Rather, I structure the fund to replicate the        
distribution of the index's duration - a measure of interest rate               
sensitivity - across the various maturities available. However, I did           
choose individual Treasury securities that I felt offered value and the         
potential to outperform others. For example, I generally favored older          
Treasury securities, while avoiding more-recently issued securities. Newly      
issued Treasuries have a higher amount of liquidity, meaning they are more      
actively traded. For that reason, their prices tend to be higher and their      
yields lower than older Treasury securities with comparable maturities.         
Because the fund's Treasury positions are core holdings, the fund doesn't       
necessarily require additional liquidity of the newest issues.                  
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FUND?                                            
A. As always, the fund's returns will be determined primarily by the            
direction of interest rates. Because valuations across sectors and between      
individual security types are very compressed, there is less room to            
differentiate performance based on a security selection than in the past.       
In this environment, with the fund positioned to closely replicate that of      
the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, its performance is expected to        
track that of the market as represented by this index.

"Market indexes are not static. The index                                       
providers - such as Lehman Brothers - often                                     
add new securities to their indexes as there are                                
innovations in the markets. Recently, Lehman                                    
has added a couple of new types of securities                                   
to its Aggregate Bond Index. The first are                                      
capital securities, which are issued primarily by                               
banks as securities into a trust, and the trust, in                             
turn, issues certificates to investors. By the end                              
of the period, about 29 of these issues were                                    
included in the index, and the category is                                      
growing quite quickly. Lehman also added                                        
Treasury Inflation Index notes, commonly                                        
referred to as inflation-indexed Treasuries. I                                  
chose to invest in some capital securities                                      
before their official inclusion because I                                       
thought their prices were attractive relative to                                
other corporate securities. On the other hand, I                                
didn't immediately add inflation-indexed bonds                                  
because I felt that their inclusion in the index                                
wasn't material enough to affect the                                            
performance of the index."

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
On April 17, 1997, the Board of Trustees approved a change in the fund's        
name from Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Portfolio to Fidelity U.S. Bond Index        
Fund. Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity            
Concord Street Trust (the trust) (formerly Fidelity Institutional Trust)        
and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares. The trust is          
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940       
Act), as an open-end management investment company organized as a               
Massachusetts business trust. The financial statements have been prepared       
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which permit        
management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the         
financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting       
policies of the fund:                                                           
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities are valued based upon a computerized matrix      
system and/or appraisals by a pricing service, both of which consider           
market transactions and dealer-supplied valuations. Securities (including       
restricted securities) for which market quotations are not readily              
available are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith under      
consistently applied procedures under the general supervision of the Board      
of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days      
or less for which quotations are not readily available are valued at            
amortized cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of which            
approximate current value.                                                      
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to      
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for      
its fiscal year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding     
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."                        
INVESTMENT INCOME. Interest income, which includes accretion of original        
issue discount, is accrued as earned.                                           
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.      
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the        
funds in the trust.                                                             
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are declared daily and paid        
monthly from net investment income. Distributions from realized gains, if       
any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date.                                      
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles. These differences, which may result in distribution                 
reclassifications, are primarily due to differing treatments for paydown        
gains/losses on certain securities, market discount, capital loss               
carryforwards and losses deferred due to wash sales.                            
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.              
Distributions in excess of net investment income and accumulated                
undistributed net realized gain (loss) on investments may include temporary     
book and tax basis differences that will reverse in a subsequent period.        
Any taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end is distributed in       
the following year.                                                             
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund, along with other affiliated       
entities of Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR), may transfer          
uninvested cash balances into one or more joint trading accounts. These         
balances are invested in one or more repurchase agreements for U.S.             
Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                                         
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency           
Securities are transferred to an account of the fund, or to the Joint           
Trading Account, at a bank custodian. The securities are marked-to-market       
daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the principal amount of       
the repurchase agreement (including accrued interest). FMR, the fund's          
investment adviser, is responsible for determining that the value of the        
underlying securities remains in accordance with the market value               
requirements stated above.                                                      
2. OPERATING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                               
DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS. The fund may purchase or sell securities on      
a delayed delivery basis. Payment and delivery may take place a month or        
more after the date of the transaction. The price of the underlying             
securities and the date when the securities will be delivered and paid for      
are fixed at the time the transaction is negotiated. The market values of       
the securities purchased or sold on a delayed delivery basis are identified     
as such in the fund's schedule of investments. The fund may receive             
compensation for interest forgone in the purchase of a delayed delivery         
security. With respect to purchase commitments, the fund identifies             
securities as segregated in its custodial records with a value at least         
equal to the amount of the commitment. Losses may arise due to changes in       
the market value of the underlying securities or if the counterparty does       
not perform under the contract.                                                 
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                          
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $429,339,490 and $328,983,833, respectively, of which U.S.           
government and government agency obligations aggregated $345,638,734 and        
$280,542,613, respectively.                                                     
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS                                                  
WITH AFFILIATES.                                                                
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR receives a fee that       
is computed daily at an annual rate of .32% of the fund's average net           
assets.                                                                         
TRANSFER AGENT FEES. Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company,     
Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of FMR, is the fund's transfer, dividend             
disbursing and shareholder servicing agent. FIIOC receives account fees and     
asset-based fees that vary according to account size and type of account.       
FIIOC pays for typesetting, printing and mailing of all shareholder             
reports, except proxy statements. For the period, the transfer agent fees       
were equivalent to an annual rate of .21% of average net assets.                
ACCOUNTING FEES. Fidelity Service Company, Inc., an affiliate of FMR,           
maintains the fund's accounting records. The fee is based on the level of       
average net assets for the month plus out-of-pocket expenses.                   
5. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
FMR voluntarily agreed to reimburse the fund's operating expenses               
(excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and extraordinary             
expenses) above an annual rate of .32% of average net assets. For the           
period, the reimbursement reduced the expenses by $1,475,845.                   
In addition, the fund has entered into arrangements with its custodian and      
transfer agent whereby interest earned on uninvested cash balances was used     
to offset a portion of the fund's expenses. During the period, the fund's       
custodian and transfer agent fees were reduced by $15,775 and $40,191,          
respectively, under these arrangements.                                         
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

To the Trustees of Fidelity Concord Street Trust (formerly Fidelity             
Institutional Trust) and the Shareholders of Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund      
(formerly Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Portfolio):                                  
In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the schedule of investments (except for Moody's and Standard &        
Poor's ratings), and the related statements of operations and of changes in     
net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all material         
respects, the financial position of Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund (formerly     
Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Portfolio) (a fund of Fidelity Concord Street          
trust) (formerly Fidelity Institutional Trust) at February 28, 1997, the        
results of its operations for the year then ended, and the changes in its       
net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated in            
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial       
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial        
statements") are the responsibility of the Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund's      
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial      
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which       
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance       
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.       
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the           
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the              
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,        
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe         
that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at February 28,
1997 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers and the application       
of alternative auditing procedures where confirmations from brokers were        
not received, provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application Start Printed Page 61174may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 450 5th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (tel. (202) 942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Each Company is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company and is organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Each Company offers shares of one or more series (“Funds”) each with its own investment objectives, policies and restrictions. Shares of Variable Insurance Products Fund II are offered solely to insurance company separate accounts, which are used to fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts. FMR is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Applicants request that the relief extend to any person controlling, controlled by, or is under common control with FMR (an “Adviser”) and any additional series of the Companies organized in the future and advised by an Adviser (“Future Funds,” collectively with the Funds, the “Subadvised Funds”), provided that such Future Funds operate in substantially the same manner as described in the application.[1] 

2. The Adviser acts as investment adviser to each Fund under an investment advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Companies on behalf of the Funds (“Advisory Agreement”). The Advisory Agreement was approved by the Companies” board of trustees (“Board”), including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in sections 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Trustees”) and by the shareholders of the Funds. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides each Fund with investment research, advice and supervision and administrative services. For its services, the Adviser receives a management fee at an annual rate based on a percentage of the average daily net assets of each Fund. 
3. The Advisory Agreements authorize the Adviser to enter into separate subadvisory agreements (“Subadvisory Agreements”) with one or more investment subadvisers (“Subadvisers”). The specific investment decisions for each Subadvised Fund are made by a Subadviser, which has discretionary authority to invest the assets of a particular Subadvised Fund, subject to the general supervision and oversight by the Adviser and the Board.[2] 
           The Adviser retains the responsibility to oversee Subadvisers and to recommend to the Board the hiring, termination and replacement of the Subadvisers. The Adviser selects Subadvisers based on the Adviser's evaluation of the Subadvisers' skills and abilities in managing assets. The Adviser pays the Subadvisers the fees specified in the Subadvisory Agreements out of the fees paid by the Subadvised Funds to the Adviser. 
4. In connection with the Lending Program, an Agent will enter into an agreement (“Securities Lending Agreement”) with each Subadvised Fund. Each Subadvised Fund that participates in the Lending Program is referred to as a “Lending Fund.” The Securities Lending Agreement will authorize the Agent to enter into agreements (“Borrowing Agreement”) with entities that are designated by the Agent and approved by the Subadvised Fund as eligible to borrow securities (“Borrowers”) to lend them portfolio securities of the Lending Funds. Pursuant to the Borrowing Agreement, the Agent delivers Lending Funds' portfolio securities to Borrowers in exchange for Cash Collateral or other collateral, such as U.S. government securities. 
5. The Securities Lending Agreement will authorize and instruct the Agent, as agent for the Subadvised Fund, to invest the Cash Collateral in accordance with specific guidelines or instructions provided by the Subadvised Fund. These guidelines or instructions will identify the particular Investment Funds and other investment vehicles, instruments and accounts, if any, in which cash collateral may be invested, and the maximum and minimum amounts of Cash Collateral that may be invested in the Investment Funds and other authorized investments. For its services as securities lending agent, the Agent will be compensated based on a percentage of the revenue generated by the Subadvised Funds' participation in the Lending Program.[3] 

6. Investment Funds will be open-end management investment companies registered under the Act (“Registered Investment Funds”). Investment Funds also may include investment companies that are exempt from registration under the Act in reliance on sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act (“Private Investment Funds”). Each Investment Fund will be established for the investment of cash collateral and advised by an Agent serving as the securities lending agent for that Lending Fund, or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Agent. The Investment Funds will invest in high quality money market instruments, short-term bonds and such other investments that are consistent with capital preservation and the increased needs of liquidity associated with securities lending transactions. 
7. Applicants request relief to permit: (a) The Adviser and the Subadvised Funds to hire Subadvisers and materially amend the Subadvisory Agreements without shareholder approval; (b) the Lending Funds to use Cash Collateral to purchase shares of the Investment Funds and the Investment Funds to redeem shares from the Lending Funds; and (c) an Agent to receive fees based on a share of the revenue generated by the securities lending activities of a Lending Fund. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
A. Relief To Hire Subadvisers and Materially Amend Subadvisory Agreements 
1. Section 15(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that has been approved by the vote of the company's outstanding voting securities. Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series company affected by a matter must approve such matter if the Act requires shareholder approval. 
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy Start Printed Page 61175and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act to permit the Adviser and the Subadvised Funds, subject to approval by the Board, to enter into and materially amend Subadvisory Agreements without shareholder approval. The requested relief would not extend to any Subadviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Company, the Subadvised Fund or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a Subadviser to one or more of the Subadvised Funds (“Affiliated Subadviser”). 
3. Applicants assert that investors expect the Adviser and the Board to select one or more Subadvisers for the Subadvised Funds and look to the Adviser when they have questions or concerns about the Subadvised Fund's management or investment performance. Applicants contend that the role of the Subadviser, from the perspective of the investor, is comparable to that of the individual portfolio managers employed by other investment advisory firms. Applicants also contend that requiring shareholder approval of Subadvisory Agreements would impose expenses and unnecessary delays on the Subadvised Funds and could prevent the prompt implementation of actions deemed advisable by the Adviser and the Board. Applicants note that the Advisory Agreements will continue to be fully subject to section 15 of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act. 
B. Investment of Cash Collateral by the Lending Funds in the Investment Funds 
1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that no registered investment company may acquire securities of another investment company if such securities represent more than 3% of the acquired company's outstanding voting stock, more than 5% of the acquiring company's total assets, or if such securities, together with the securities of other acquired investment companies, represent more than 10% of the acquiring company's total assets. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act provides that no registered open-end investment company may sell its securities to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally. 
2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants request relief under section 12(d)(1)(J) to permit the Lending Funds to invest Cash Collateral in the Registered Investment Funds in excess of the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B). 
3. Applicants represent that the Investment Funds will be designed as vehicles to be used specifically in connection with securities lending transactions. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not result in inappropriate layering of either sales charges or investment advisory fees. Shares of the Investment Funds sold to the Lending Funds will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, asset-based distribution fee, or service fee. Applicants further state that since investment advisory fees are calculated on the net, rather than the total, assets of the Lending Funds, and since Cash Collateral does not increase net assets, the Lending Funds would not pay duplicative advisory fees with respect to investments made with Cash Collateral. Applicants also state that each Investment Fund will be operated for the purpose of providing the necessary liquidity to satisfy the demands of the Lending Program and, therefore, will not be susceptible to control through the threat of large scale redemptions. Finally, applicants state that an Investment Fund will not acquire securities of any other investment company in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except to the extent permitted by condition 7 of the conditions regarding participating in a Lending Program below. For these reasons, applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not give rise to the abuses that sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) were intended to prevent. 
4. Section 17(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any affiliated person or principal underwriter of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person (“second-tier affiliate”), acting as principal, to sell or purchase any security to or from such investment company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an affiliated person to include any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person, as well as any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person, and in the case of an investment company, its investment adviser. The Adviser is an affiliated person of each Lending Fund under section 2(a)(3). Because the Lending Funds share a common investment adviser, the Lending Funds may be deemed to be under “common control” and therefore affiliated persons of each other. In addition, a Lending Fund could own more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of an Investment Fund. As a result, each Lending Fund and the Investment Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons (or second-tier affiliates) of each other Lending Fund. As a result, applicants request relief from section 17(a) under sections 6(c) and 17(b) to permit the sale of shares of the Investment Funds to the Lending Funds and the redemption of the shares by the Lending Funds from the Investment Funds. 
5. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the SEC to exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general policy of the Act. 
6. Applicants submit that the requested relief satisfies the standards for relief in sections 6(c) and 17(b). Applicants state that the Lending Funds will be treated like any other shareholders in the Investment Funds, and purchase and sell shares of the Investment Funds on the same terms and on the same basis, including price, as all other shareholders of the Investment Funds. Applicants assert that the proposed transactions comply with each Lending Fund's investment restrictions and policies. Applicants state that Cash Collateral of a Lending Fund that is a money market fund will not be used to acquire shares of any Investment Fund that does not comply with rule 2a-7 under the Act. Applicants further state that the investment of Cash Collateral will comply with all present and future Commission and staff positions concerning securities lending. Applicants also state that the Private Investment Funds will comply with the major substantive provisions of the Act, including the prohibitions against affiliated transactions, leveraging and issuing senior securities, and rights of redemption. 
7. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit any Start Printed Page 61176affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any second-tier affiliate, acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit sharing plan, in which the investment company participates. Rule 17d-1 permits the SEC to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section 17(d). In determining whether to approve a transaction, the SEC is to consider whether the proposed transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation of the investment companies is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants. 
8. Applicants state that the Lending Funds (by purchasing and redeeming shares of the Investment Funds), a Subadviser (by managing the portfolio securities of the Subadvised Funds while at the same time acting as Agent for the Lending Funds), an Agent (by acting as lending agent, investing Cash Collateral in the Investment Funds, and receiving a portion of the revenue generated by securities lending transactions), and the Investment Funds (by selling shares to and redeeming shares from the Lending Funds) could be deemed to be participants in a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants submit that the proposed investments by the Lending Funds in the Investment Funds meet the standards of rule 17d-1 for the reasons discussed above, particularly that the Lending Funds will invest in the Investment Funds on the same basis as any other shareholder. 
C. Payment of Fees by a Lending Fund to an Agent 
1. As noted above, section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit joint transactions involving investment companies and their affiliated persons unless the SEC has approved the transaction. Applicants state that an Agent may serve as a Subadviser for certain series of a particular Company,[4] 
           while other series of that Company could be advised by entities that are not affiliated with the Agent. Each series of the Company could be deemed to be under common control, and thus an affiliated person of each other series. The Agent thus could be deemed an affiliated person of any series for which it acts as Subadviser and a second-tier affiliate of those series for which it does not act as Subadviser. Moreover, an Agent that is a bank may own more than 5% of the voting securities of a Lending Fund in a fiduciary capacity, and thus be an affiliated person of that Lending Fund and a second-tier affiliate of those series of a Company in which it does not own a 5% interest. Further, if a Lending Fund acquired more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of an Investment Fund advised by the Agent, the Agent could be deemed a second-tier affiliate of the Lending Fund. As a result, the prohibitions of section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 would apply to activities involving the series and the Agent, including the Agent's activities as lending agent and the receipt of a share of the revenue from the series' lending activities. Applicants request relief to permit an Agent acting as lending agent to a Lending Fund to receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the Lending Fund's participation in the Lending Program. Each Agent will have an established securities lending program with numerous other unaffiliated institutional investors participating as lenders in the Agent's program. 
2. Applicants propose that each Lending Fund will adopt the following procedures to ensure that the proposed fee arrangement and the other terms governing the relationship with the Agent will meet the standards of rule 17d-1: 
(a) In connection with the approval of the Agent as lending agent for a Lending Fund and implementation of the proposed fee arrangement, a majority of the Board (including a majority of the Independent Trustees) of the Lending Fund will determine (i) the Securities Lending Agreement with the Agent is in the best interests of the Lending Fund and its shareholders; (ii) the services to be performed by the Agent are appropriate for the Lending Fund; (iii) the nature and quality of the services performed by the Agent are at least equal to those provided by others offering the same or similar services for similar compensation; and (iv) the fees for the Agent's services are within the range of, but in any event no higher than, the fees charged by the Agent for services of the same nature and quality provided to unaffiliated parties. 
(b) Each Lending Fund's contract with the Agent for lending agent services will be reviewed annually by the Board and will be approved for continuation only if a majority of the Board (including a majority of the Independent Trustees) makes the findings referred to in paragraph (a) above. 
(c) In connection with the initial implementation of an arrangement whereby the Agent will be compensated as lending agent based on a percentage of the revenue generated by a Lending Fund's participation in the Program, the Board will secure a certificate from the Agent attesting to the factual accuracy of clause (iv) in paragraph (a) above. In addition, the Board will request and evaluate, and the Agent will furnish, such information and materials as the Board, with and upon the advice of agents, consultants, or counsel, determines to be appropriate in making the findings referred to in paragraph (a) above. Such information shall include, in any event, information concerning the fees charged by the Agent to other institutional investors for performing similar services. 
(d) The Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will (i) no less frequently than quarterly determine, on the basis of reports submitted by the Agent, that the loan transactions during the proceeding quarter were conducted in compliance with the conditions and procedures set forth in the application; and (ii) review no less frequently than annually the conditions and procedures set forth in the application for continuing appropriateness. 
(e) Each Lending Fund will (i) maintain and preserve permanently in an easily accessible place a written copy of the procedures and conditions (and modifications thereto) described in the application or otherwise followed in connection with lending securities under the Lending Program; and (ii) maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any loan transaction pursuant to the Lending Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, a written record of each loan transaction setting forth a description of the security loaned, the identity of the person on the other side of the loan transaction, the terms of the loan transaction, and the information or materials upon which the determination was made that each loan was made in accordance with the procedures set forth above and the conditions to the application. 
Applicants' Conditions 
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: Start Printed Page 61177

A. Relief To Enter Into and Materially Amend Subadvisory Agreements 
1. Before a Subadvised Fund may rely on the order requested herein, the operation of the Subadvised Fund in the manner described in the application will be approved by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities (or, if the Subadvised Fund serves as a funding medium for any sub-account of a registered separate account, pursuant to voting instructions provided by the unitholders of the sub-account) as defined in the Act, or, in the case of a Future Fund whose public shareholders (or variable contract owners through a separate account) purchased shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition number 2 below, by the sole initial shareholder(s) before offering shares of that Subadvised Fund to the public (or variable contract owners through a separate account). 
2. Each Subadvised Fund will disclose in its prospectus the existence, substance, and effect of any order granted pursuant to the application. In addition, each Subadvised Fund will hold itself out to the public as employing the management structure described in the application. The prospectus will prominently disclose that the Adviser has the ultimate responsibility to oversee Subadvisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement. 
3. Before relying on the requested Manager of Managers relief, each Subadvised Fund that sought its shareholders' approval to operate in the manner described in the Application prior to the date of the requested order and subsequently sold shares based on a prospectus that does not comply with condition 2 above will provide its shareholders (or, if the Subadvised Fund serves as a funding medium for any sub-account of a registered separate account, then the unitholders of the sub-account) with at least 30 days prior written notice of (a) the substance and effect of the Manager of Managers relief and (b) the fact that the Subadvised Fund intends to employ the management structure described in the Application. 
4. At all times, a majority of each Company's Board will be Independent Trustees, and the nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees will be at the discretion of the then existing Independent Trustees. 
5. The Adviser will not enter into a Subadvisory Agreement with any Affiliated Subadviser without that agreement, including the compensation to be paid thereunder, being approved by the shareholders (or, if the Subadvised Fund serves as a funding medium for any sub-account of a registered separate account, pursuant to voting instructions provided by the unitholders of the sub-account) of the applicable Subadvised Fund. 
6. When a Subadviser change is proposed for a Subadvised Fund with an Affiliated Subadviser, the Board of the corresponding Company, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will make a separate finding, reflected in the Company's Board minutes, that the change is in the best interests of the Subadvised Fund and its shareholders (or, if the Subadvised Fund serves as a funding medium for any sub-account of a registered separate account, in the best interests of the Subadvised Fund and the unitholders of any sub-account) and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Adviser or the Affiliated Subadviser derives an inappropriate advantage. 
7. Within 90 days of the hiring of any new Subadviser, shareholders (or, if the Subadvised Fund serves as a funding medium for any sub-account of a registered separate account, the unitholders of the sub-account) will be furnished all information about a new Subadviser that would be contained in a proxy statement, including any change in such disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser. Each Subadvised Fund will meet this condition by providing shareholders (or, if the Subadvised Fund serves as a funding medium for any sub-account of a registered separate account, then by providing unitholders of the sub-account) with an Information Statement meeting the requirements of Regulation 14C, Schedule 14C and Item 22 of Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within 90 days of the hiring of a Subadviser. 
8. The Adviser will provide general management services to each Subadvised Fund, including overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of each Subadvised Fund's portfolio, and subject to review and approval by the Board, will (a) set the Subadvised Fund's overall investment strategies; (b) select Subadviser(s); (c) monitor and evaluate the performance of Subadviser(s); (d) ensure that the Subadviser(s) comply with each Subadvised Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions; and (e) allocate and, where appropriate, reallocate a Subadvised Fund's assets among its Subadvisers. 
9. No trustee, director or officer of a Company or director or officer of the Adviser will own directly or indirectly (other than through a pooled investment vehicle that is not controlled by that trustee, director or officer) any interest in a Subadviser except for (a) ownership of interests in the Adviser or any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Adviser; or (b) ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of any class of equity or debt of a publicly-traded company that is either a Subadviser or an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a Subadviser. 
A. Lending Program 
1. The Lending Program of each Lending Fund will comply with all present and future applicable Commission and staff positions regarding securities lending arrangements. 
2. The approval of a Lending Fund's Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will be required for the initial and subsequent approvals of the Agent's service as securities lending agent for the Lending Fund under the Lending Program, for the institution of all procedures relating to the Lending Program as it relates to the Lending Fund, and for any periodic review of loan transactions for which the Agent acted as lending agent under the Lending Program. 
3. A majority of a Lending Fund's Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will initially and at least annually thereafter determine that the investment of Cash Collateral in shares of the Investment Funds is in the best interest of shareholders of the Lending Fund. 
4. Investment in shares of the Investment Funds will be in accordance with each Lending Fund's respective investment restrictions and will be consistent with each Lending Fund's policies as set forth in its prospectus and statement of additional information. A Lending Fund that complies with rule 2a-7 under the Act will not invest its Cash Collateral in an Investment Fund that does not comply with rule 2a-7 under the Act. 
5. Investment in shares of an Investment Fund by a particular Lending Fund will be in accordance with the guidelines regarding investment of Cash Collateral specified by the Lending Fund in the Securities Lending Agreement. A Lending Fund's Cash Collateral will be invested in a particular Investment Fund only if that Investment Fund has been approved for investment by the Lending Fund and if that Investment Fund invests in the types of instruments that the Lending Start Printed Page 61178Fund has authorized for the investment of its Cash Collateral. 
6. The shares of the Investment Funds that are sold to and redeemed from the Lending Funds will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee under a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b-1, or service fee (as defined in rule 2830(b)(9) of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers). 
7. An Investment Fund will not acquire securities of any other investment company in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; except to the extent that the Investment Fund (a) receives securities of another investment company as a dividend or as a result of a plan or reorganization of a company (other than a plan devised for the purpose of evading section 12(d)(1) of the Act) or (b) acquires (or is deemed to have acquired) securities of another investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the Commission permitting the Investment Fund to (i) acquire securities of one or more affiliated investment companies for short-term cash management purposes or (ii) lend cash to another fund. 
8. A Lending Fund may enter into a Securities Lending Agreement that permits the investment of its cash collateral in a Private Investment Fund only if the Securities Lending Agreement provides that:
(a) Any Private Investment Fund that is operated as a “money market fund” (“Private Money Market Fund”) will comply with rule 2a-7 under the Act and will value its shares, as of the close of business on each business day, using the “amortized cost method,” as defined in rule 2a-7, to determine the net asset value per share of the Private Money Market Fund. In addition, the Private Money Market Fund will, subject to the approval of the Private Money Market Fund's board of directors or trustees (collectively with the board of directors or trustees of any Private Investment Fund, the “Trustee”), adopt the monitoring procedures described in rule 2a-7(c)(7) under the Act and the Private Money Market Fund's adviser (collectively with the adviser to any Private Investment Fund, the “Private Fund Adviser”) will comply with these procedures and take any other actions as are required to be taken pursuant to these procedures. The Lending Funds may only purchase shares of the Private Money Market Fund if the Private Fund Adviser determines on an ongoing basis that the Private Money Market Funds is in compliance with rule 2a-7. The Private Fund Adviser will preserve for a period of not less than six years from the date of determination, the first two years in an easily accessible place, a record of the determination and the basis upon which the determination was made. This record will be subject to examination by the SEC and its staff;
(b) The Private Investment Fund will comply with the requirements of sections 17(a), (d), and (e), and 18 of the Act as if the Private Investment Fund were a registered open-end investment company;
(c) With respect to all redemption requests made by a Lending Fund, the Private Investment Fund will comply with section 22(e) of the Act;
(d) The Private Fund Adviser shall, subject to the approval by the Trustee, adopt procedures designed to ensure that the Private Fund complies with sections 17(a), (d), (e), 18, and 22(e) of the Act. The Private Fund Adviser also will periodically review and periodically update as appropriate such procedures and will maintain books and records describing such procedures and will maintain the records required by rules 31a-1(b)(1), 31a-1(b)(2)(ii), and 31a-1(b)(9) under the Act. All books and records required to be kept pursuant to this condition will be maintained and preserved for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, and will be subject to examination by the SEC and its staff;
(e) The net asset value per share with respect to Private Investment Fund shares will be determined separately for each Private Investment Fund by dividing the value of the assets belonging to that Private Investment Fund, less the liabilities of that Private Investment Fund, by the number of shares outstanding with respect to that Private Investment Fund; and
(f) Each Lending Fund will purchase and redeem Private Investment Fund shares as of the same time and at the same price, and will receive dividends and bear its proportionate share of expenses on the same basis, as other shareholders of the Private Investment Fund. A separate account will be established in the shareholder records of the Private Investment Fund for the account of each Lending Fund.
