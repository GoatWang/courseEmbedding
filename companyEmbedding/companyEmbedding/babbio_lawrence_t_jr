					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., generally called Larry, is a former vice chairman and president of Verizon, with responsibility for the Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business units. He was also a member of the board of directors of Verizon Wireless. Since 2007, Babbio has been a senior adviser to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm.[1]
Babbio began his communications career in 1966 with New Jersey Bell Telephone. He served in a variety of positions in engineering, network construction, and technology development with New Jersey Bell and AT&T. In January 1995 he was elected vice chairman of Bell Atlantic Corporation.
Prior to the Bell Atlantic/GTE merger, Babbio was president and chief operating officer for Bell Atlantic. He shared oversight of, and responsibility for, all of the corporation's business operations, restructuring of the business units, the GTE merger process, and developing new growth opportunities.
Babbio also served as chairman of the company's Global Wireless Group, one of the largest wireless operations worldwide. He was the lead executive in charge of developing Bell Atlantic's domestic and international wireless communications strategy. Under his leadership, Bell Atlantic substantially increased the size and scope of its domestic and international wireless holdings.
In May 2002 Babbio was elected to the board of directors of Hewlett-Packard Company. He previously served on the board of Compaq Computer Corporation since 1995. He has served on the board of ARAMARK Corporation since 1999. Babbio also serves as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Stevens Institute of Technology.
He holds a B.E. in electrical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, and an M.B.A. from New York University.
Attorney General Matter[edit]
On September 17, 2009 Attorney General Anne Milgram announced charges against Lawrence Babbio and Stevens Institute of Technology president Harold J. Raveché.[2][3] According to the state's 16-count lawsuit, Stevens' leaders kept several trustees in the dark about the school's financial condition. Raveché and his administration allegedly spent the school's money at greater rates than the board approved, scavenging restricted assets, excessive loans and gifts to the school earmarked for other purposes. Milgram also sought reforms to the school's governance and accounting.
The lawsuit alleged that Raveché and Babbio misrepresented the finances of the school and caused the endowment to fall by $42 million from $157 million in 2000 to $115 million in 2009.[4] The lawsuit detailed that Raveché received below-market loans from the school, at least some of which were forgiven by Stevens.[5] The complaint also raises questions about Raveché's salary which had been greater than that of the president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a much larger, better known school.[5]
The school disputed the allegations, brought a preemptive lawsuit against the State of New Jersey, and contended that the state attorney general had overstepped her legal authority.[1] Stevens also sought unsuccessfully to keep the Attorney General's lawsuit confidential.[5]
The litigation was settled on January 15, 2010, on Milgram's last day in office.[6] The settlement required Dr. Raveché to repay low-interest loans from the school, and for Stevens to correct by-laws to forestall future allegations of perceived misconduct.[7] Raveché voluntarily stepped down as president of the Institute at the end of the 2010 academic year, after 22 years in office. He was succeeded as president in 2011 by Dr. Nariman Farvardin. Mr. Babbio's term as Board Chairman expired in May 2013, and he was succeeded as Chair by a fellow Stevens alum and Verizon executive, Ms. Virginia P. Ruesterholz. Babbio was subsequently named Chairman Emeritus of the Stevens Board by President Farvardin.
On June 6, 2016, the Consent Judgment which had been in place since January, 2010, between Stevens Institute of Technology and the New Jersey Attorney General was lifted by Court Order and with the consent of the Attorney General’s Office.The Consent Judgment arose from circumstances at Stevens pre-2010, and addressed a number of matters relating primarily to governance.
As stated in the Consent Judgment, “Stevens has fully complied with the obligations to which it agreed in the Consent Judgment and has demonstrated to the State a continued focus on maintaining best practices in the area of governance for institutions of higher education. Lifting the Consent Judgment will afford Stevens added flexibility to make further enhancements to the ways it oversees its affairs and to respond and adapt to the evolving landscape of best governance practices....”[8]

Babbio Center, Stevens Institute of Technology


My Role: Project Manager – Involved in the project from concept design through construction.
Owner: Stevens Institute of Technology
Architect: Cubellis Ecoplan
Contractor: Terminal Construction
About the Project:
The Lawrence T. Babbio, Jr. Center for Technology Management is one of the world’s preeminent institutions in the education of professionals who lead and manage technological innovation in businesses in America and around the world.  Educating managers who use technology to create extraordinary value for the societies in which they live, it offers education programs designed and delivered by leading industry practitioners who are important contributors to the creation of new knowledge in the field.   The Howe School also conducts worldclass research in several focused areas of Technology Management, especially in the domain of Technology Innovation, Commercialization and Entrepreneurship.  Research is applied in orientation and grounded in Technogenesis®.   Technogenesis is Stevens’ educational environment where students, faculty and industry collaborate to turn innovation, invention and discovery into marketplace success.Opened in the Spring of 2006, the Lawrence T. Babbio, Jr. Center for Technology Management, a six-story, 95,000 square foot structure serves as the new signature headquarters for the Wesley J. Howe School of Technology Management at Stevens Institute of Technology.  On the lower four levels, a vibrant mix of classrooms, laboratories and research library are united by an atrium lobby.  Externally, the lecture hall volume is used expressively to evoke the energy of the activity within.  Above, students, faculty and visiting business representatives work together in an office environment that is the antithesis of the “traditional” faculty office suite.  A glass-enclosed conference and open teaming area seems to hover within the top of the atrium lobby enclosure and offers a suitable environment to foster the kind of corporate partnerships that form the basis of the program.
The Center is blessed with amazing contextual opportunities. On one side is a rich and vibrant urban landscape of 6-8 story buildings of a variety of materials and historical styles. On another it faces campus buildings, gates and pathways leading to more campus-like areas of the Institute. Finally, sitting atop the cliffs to the Hudson, the site offers panoramic views of the river and the Manhattan skyline. The entrepreneurial drive and spirit of the Howe School of Technology Management was a catalyst for developing a vocabulary that highlights the contrast between a contextually-responsive primary form and vigorously sculptural and modern forms. The primary form of the building takes cues from its neighbors for materials, setbacks and various alignments of both mass and detail.  A round, tapering, metal-clad form housing lecture rooms, intersects the primary volume aggressively and helping to form a high arcade that very loosely recalls the crenellations of the adjacent gothic gateway to the original campus area. Finally, a very simple glass-clad atrium form, engages the primary form at it’s center to unite a variety of interior areas and to afford to many within the building the incredible view of the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline.  The atrium’s angled alignment acknowledges the configuration of adjacent pedestrian walkways, using this prominent site to unite the urban and more traditional landscapes of the Steven’s campus.A four-story parking garage built into the side of the promontory edge of the campus forms the base of the building.  When completed, the garage will extend toward the river, its roof top forming an expansive plaza entrance for the Babbio Center and an important new campus landscape asset.

Do you have any information on what happened that the parking garage that forms the base of the building was never completed? I would also like to know when the building was designed and built.

The building was designed from 2000-2003.  Construction was completed in 2005.
It is speculated that the parking garage was placed on hold due to city politics.
The changing of the guards if you will.

BABBIO v. BABBIO

BABBIO v. BABBIO

Lawrence T. BABBIO, Jr., Plaintiff–Respondent, v. Sheri Lee BABBIO, Defendant–Appellant.

    Decided: July 17, 2014

		FRIEDMAN, J.P., ACOSTA, SAXE, FEINMAN, GISCHE, JJ.Dechert LLP, New York (James M. McGuire of counsel), for appellant. Aronson Mayefsky & Sloan, LLP, New York (Allan E. Mayefsky and Lawrence B. Trachtenberg of counsel), for respondent.
Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Laura Drager, J.), entered August 1, 2013, which, to the extent appealed from, granted so much of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as sought a declaration that he is entitled to separate property credits for his contributions to the acquisition of the Park Avenue apartment, the Connecticut residence, and the Connecticut parcels, and declared the specific amounts of the credits to which plaintiff is entitled, and denied without prejudice so much of the motion as sought a declaration with respect to the joint Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan accounts and the interest in Greycroft Partners, L.P., declaring that plaintiff is entitled to separate property credits with respect to those items but that the amounts of the credits cannot be determined at present, unanimously modified, on the law, to deny the motion with respect to the Connecticut parcels and the funds paid at closing for the purchase of the Park Avenue apartment from the parties' joint account, and to declare that plaintiff is not entitled to separate property credits with respect to those items, and is not entitled to separate property credits with respect to the joint Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan accounts and the interest in Greycroft Partners, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.The parties' prenuptial agreement provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]n the event of an Operative Event, Marital Property [as defined elsewhere in the agreement] shall be distributed equally between [the parties] in accordance with the following provisions, except that if the parties have been married for ten (10) years or less and either party is able to identify One Million ($1,000,000) Dollars or more of Separate Property that was used for the acquisition of the Marital Property, that party shall first receive the amount of his or her contribution of Separate Property prior to the division of the remaining value of such property, if any” (¶ 6[e] ). “Operative Event” is defined as, inter alia, “the delivery by [either party] to the other of written notification ․ of an intention to terminate the marriage” (¶ 5[a] ).Construing the parties' prenuptial agreement in accord with the plain meaning of its terms, and interpreting every part of the agreement “with reference to the whole” (see Beal Sav. Bank v. Sommer, 8 NY3d 318, 324 [2007] ), we find that eligibility for a separate property credit upon the distribution of marital property in the event of an “Operative Event” is determined at the time of the “Operative Event” and that the party seeking the credit must have contributed $1 million or more of his or her own separate property directly to the acquisition of the particular item of marital property at issue.It is implicit in paragraph 6(e) that the length of the parties' marriage is to be calculated as of the date of the Operative Event, and not, as the wife urges, as of the date on which the marital property is distributed. Moreover, the date of the Operative Event provides certainty that the date of distribution does not provide, and it is reasonable to infer that the parties intended that there be certainty with respect to the date their rights to separate property credits (and other rights and obligations) are determined. Support for this construction is also provided by clauses stating that “the Marital Property shall be valued as near as practicable to the time of the Operative Event” (¶ 6[e][i] ) and that “the distribution contemplated by this paragraph shall occur as quickly as practicable following the happening of an Operative Event” (¶ 6[e][iv] ). Since the Operative Event occurred before the parties had been married 10 years, the husband is eligible for separate property credits to the extent he contributed $1 million or more of separate property to the acquisition of any marital property.We conclude that the wife is correct in regard to the husband's recouping of his separate property; the husband must show that he contributed $1 million or more of separate property to the acquisition of each item of marital property to be distributed, rather than that he contributed $1 million or more in the aggregate. To ascertain the parties' intentions in regard to the operation of the separate property credit, we consider the phrasing of the separate property credit exception of 6(e), interpreting it with reference to the apparent purpose of paragraph 6 and the general purpose of the entire agreement as a whole (see generally Beal Sav. Bank v. Sommer, 8 NY3d at 324–325). The general purpose of the agreement is to provide a degree of protection to both parties. In the event the marriage lasted less than 10 years, the agreement protects the husband from the absolute loss of large amounts of separate funds he contributed to the marriage, while also protecting the wife from having everything that was purchased for their use as a married couple reclaimed by the husband.The language of the agreement's exception to the rule of dividing marital property equally provides:“[I]f the parties have been married for ten (10) years or less and either party is able to identify One Million ($1,000,000) Dollars or more of Separate Property that was used for the acquisition of the Marital Property, that party shall first receive the amount of his or her contribution of Separate Property prior to the division of the remaining value of such property, if any” (emphasis added).The use of the definite article before “Marital Property,” and the later reference to “such property,” reflect an intent to apply the credit to each piece of marital property as it is being divided, a view supported by the subparagraphs that immediately follow, which specifically contemplate an item-by-item consideration of the marital property for purposes of its division. Moreover, paragraph 4(d) defines “Marital Property,” inter alia, as “all property used jointly by the parties with a cost value of $100,000, or less,” but under the aggregation theory the husband would get all the proceeds of every sale, and the wife would lose the benefit of the provision, rendering it meaningless. Indeed, given the husband's enormous wealth and the parties' stated intention to reside in New York, under the aggregation theory, the husband's contribution of more than $1 million to a marital residence alone would meet the threshold, rendering the creation of a threshold provision meaningless.The prenuptial agreement provides that separate property transferred into any form of joint ownership becomes marital property (¶ 4[a] ). That is, separate property placed into joint ownership does not retain its character as separate property. Thus, the husband also must show that he contributed separate property directly to the acquisition of the marital property at issue, not merely that he placed his separate property into a joint account from which funds were subsequently withdrawn and used for the purchase of marital property. Paragraph 4 of the agreement, which defines marital property as property transferred into joint ownership, makes no exception for transfers made as a convenience.The husband failed to demonstrate that he contributed $1 million or more in separate property to the acquisition of the Connecticut parcels and to the parties' interest in Greycroft Partners. Thus, he is not entitled to a separate property credit for his contributions to the acquisition of those properties.Nor is the husband entitled to a credit for separate property he transferred into the parties' joint Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan accounts. In contrast with paragraph 4, which specifies that the category includes property “transferred by either party into any form of joint ownership” as well as property “acquired with joint funds, acquired out of joint accounts or acquired by use of credit cards in joint name,” the separate property credit provision is phrased to apply only to separate property used directly for the “acquisition” of marital property. Contrary to the husband's contention, it is not reasonable to interpret the term “acquisition” so broadly as to include the act of obtaining marital property via transfer.To the extent marital property is to be distributed under the agreement, each party is entitled to appreciation on his or her share, which includes post-Operative Event appreciation on the Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan accounts.Since the husband showed that approximately $5 million of his separate property was used to acquire the Connecticut residence, he is entitled to a separate property credit for that contribution.The husband is not entitled to a credit for the $8.5 million paid from the parties' joint account at closing on the Park Avenue apartment. Although those funds were previously his separate property, they became marital property when he transferred them into the joint account. Since the husband's transfer of separate funds into a joint account transformed those funds into marital property for all purposes, when funds from that joint account were then used for the purchase of the parties' apartment, there was no use of separate property for the acquisition of the apartment. In any event, there is no evidence that the joint account was established only for convenience, or that the fund transfer was merely transitory, since the funds remained in the joint account for a month (cf. Wade v. Steinfeld, 15 AD3d 390 [2d Dept 2005] [money kept in joint account for three days] ).The husband is entitled to a credit for the $2.3 million he paid from his separate property for renovation costs on the Park Avenue apartment. We find that the renovation costs expended by the husband from his separate property were inextricably bound to the acquisition of the apartment itself. A separate property credit is therefore also properly claimed for the $910, 00 down payment on the Park Avenue apartment that the husband paid from his separate property since the $1 million threshold for the separate property contribution to the apartment has been met.

Manhattan Transfers
Can You Hear Me Now? Former Verizon Chief Reaches $24 M. Buyer for Park Avenue Penthouse

			By Kim Velsey • 09/16/13 10:00am































Guess who got $24 million for their penthouse? (Patrick McMullen)
We bet no calls got dropped when this deal was closing: Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., the former president and vice chair of Verizon, just sold his sprawling penthouse at 720 Park Avenue for $24 million.
Mr. Babbio and wife Sheri‘s former abode is large enough—10 rooms in all, including a 31-foot-by-27-foot living room and five dramatic terraces (yes, five)—that it might require some telecommunications savvy just to reach the apartment’s other inhabitants. Fortunately, the building was designed by Rosario Candela, so the layout is impeccable. Oh, and there’s 90-feet of Park Avenue frontage to coo over, plus a plethora of floor-to-ceiling and panoramic 6-over-6 windows to gaze at it from.
The buyers, Leah and Michael Weisberg according to city records, must have been impressed, given that they paid just under the $25 million ask. Mr. Babbio, who retired from Verizon in 2007, bought the co-op before such things were public knowledge so we can’t tell how much of a killing he made in this deal, but he should have plenty of cash to keep him warm in his dotage. Of course, as is the case with most retired corporate chiefs, Mr. Babbio is staying busy—he’s working as an adviser to private equity firm Warburg Pincus and, naturally, serving on a few corporate boards.
We can’t even see the end of this terrace.
The Weisbergs will be moving in from just up the Avenue—they list their address as 791 Park on the deed. Assuming it’s the same Leah Weisberg who was interviewed in a 1987 New York Times article about buyers shopping for co-ops on both side of the park—shocking!—she’s come down hard in favor of the Upper East Side. Then again, her budget ceiling is no longer $3 million and we’re guessing these days even some Upper East Siders can be found walking around in jogging clothes—one of the advantages of Upper West Side living that Ms. Weisberg spoke longingly of back then.
In any event, the Weisbergs gave the pad a warm reception, snapping it up within a month of its March market debut. Kudos to listing broker John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens—this is the second $20 million-plus deal that he closed at 720 Park this summer (a 14-room spread sold for $23 million in July). We guess someone wasn’t spending much time in the Hamptons this year.
