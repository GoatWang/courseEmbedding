                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate Cabela's Credit Card Master Note Trust, Series 2016-I; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Cabela's Credit Card Master Note Trust, Series 2016-I; 
      Presale Issued
    





June 21, 2016 03:52 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to Cabela's Credit 
      Card Master Note Trust's asset-backed notes, series 2016-I:
    

      --$TBD class A-1 fixed-rate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$TBD class A-2 floating-rate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32,000,000 class B fixed-rate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,000,000 class C fixed-rate 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,000,000 class D fixed-rate 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch's expected ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool; 
      available credit enhancement; World's Foremost Bank's underwriting and 
      servicing capabilities; and the transaction's legal and cash flow 
      structures, which employ early redemption triggers.
    

      The transaction structure is similar to series 2015-II, with credit 
      enhancement totaling 15% for class A, credit enhancement of 7% for the 
      class B, credit enhancement of 2.75% plus an amount from a spread 
      account for the class C, and credit enhancement of an amount from a 
      spread account for the class D notes only.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a 
      reduction in monthly payment rate (MPR), and 3) a combination stress of 
      higher defaults and lower Monthly Payment Rate (MPR).
    

      Increasing defaults alone has the least impact on rating migration even 
      in the most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating 
      sensitivity to a reduction in MPR is more pronounced with a moderate 
      stress, of a 25% reduction, leading to possible downgrades across all 
      classes. The harshest scenario assumes both stresses occur 
      simultaneously. The severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades 
      to all classes.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with all 
      performance metrics within Fitch's initial expectations. For further 
      discussion of Fitch's sensitivity analysis, please see the presale 
      report related to the transaction listed above.

Cabela's Inc. Announces Closing Of $400 Million Securitization






Business Wire




Jul 16, 2015 4:05 PM EDT













 




























































  Cabela's Incorporated (NYSE:CAB) announced today that Cabela's Credit Card Master Note Trust successfully completed the sale of $400 million of Asset-Backed Notes, Series 2015-II. The securitization transaction included the issuance of $240 million of Class A-1 Notes, which accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.25% per year, and $100 million of Class A-2 Notes, which accrue interest at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 0.67% per year. The securitization transaction also included the issuance of three subordinated classes of notes in the aggregate principal amount of $60 million. World's Foremost Bank, Cabela's wholly owned subsidiary, purchased each of the subordinated classes of notes. Each class of notes issued in the securitization transaction has an expected life of approximately five years, with a legal maturity of approximately eight years.

"We are thrilled to announce the completion of our second SEC registered term securitization for 2015," said Tommy Millner, Cabela's Chief Executive Officer.

World's Foremost Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, procured each of the subordinated classes of notes.Corporate issuances are in high demand, which in turn, led the company to increase the transaction by $200 million. U.S. treasuries are yielding low rates, driving investors toward the notes issued by sound companies. The issued notes have a maturity period of roughly five years, with legal maturity of eight years. The move will boost its financial services segment and will escalate the growth of the credit card portfolio of the World’s Foremost Bank.The company’s Financial Services Business segment plays an integral part in supporting the merchandising business by encouraging customer loyalty rewards program that will result in increase in revenue, profitability and customer retention at its Retail and Direct businesses, leading to overall growth in sales and earnings.Boasting a solid balance sheet, feasible strategy, operating efficiencies and healthy product demand, Cabela’s offers its investors one of the strongest growth profiles. Moreover, the company remains confident about achieving its targeted long-term return on invested capital of 12% to 14%.Further, Cabela's CLUB Visa program continues to register solid growth, reflecting increase in average active accounts with enhancements in delinquencies and net charge-offs along with lower funding cost.However, the outdoor recreation and casual apparel and footwear markets are highly fragmented and competitive. Cabela’s faces stiff competition from discount stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corporation (TGT).Currently, we maintain a long-term Outperform rating on Cabela's. However, the company holds a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates into a short-term Buy recommendation.Read the Full Research Report on CABRead the Full Research Report on WMT Read the Full Research Report on TGT Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read the analyst report on CAB,WMT,TGTReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHuge leak may confirm one of the hottest new features hiding in Apple’s iPhone 8BGR NewsEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderBuffalo Wild Wings is killing one of customers' favorite dealsBusiness InsiderThe Latest: Operator says ride was inspected before accidentAssociated PressNew "Super-Coffee" Makes You Feel Years Younger!VitaCupSponsoredAll the companies in Jeff Bezos’s empire, in one (large) chartMarketWatchAmazon profit slumps 77 percent as costs surge, shares fallReutersRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredUndefeated boxer who now fights MMA on Mayweather-McGregor fight: I don't know if it would matter if there were 2 Conor McGregors in that ringBusiness InsiderThrill ride OK'd hours before deadly state fair accidentAssociated PressTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredRolls-Royce Motor CEO: We’re not in the auto business.

      Fitch Rates Cabela's Credit Card Master Note Trust, Series 2016-I
    





June 29, 2016 02:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Cabela's Credit Card 
      Master Note Trust's asset-backed notes, series 2016-I, as follows:
    

      --$570,000,000 class A-1 fixed-rate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$280,000,000 class A-2 floating-rate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,000,000 class B fixed-rate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,500,000 class C fixed-rate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,500,000 class D fixed-rate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch's ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool, available 
      credit enhancement (CE), World's Foremost Bank's underwriting and 
      servicing capabilities, and the transaction's legal and cash flow 
      structures, which employ early redemption triggers.
    

      The transaction structure is similar to series 2015-II, with CE 
      totalling 15% for class A, 7% for the class B, 2.75% plus an amount from 
      a spread account for the class C, and CE of an amount from a spread 
      account for the class D notes only.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a 
      reduction in monthly payment rate (MPR), and 3) a combination stress of 
      higher defaults and lower MPR.
    

      Increasing defaults alone has the least impact on rating migration even 
      in the most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating 
      sensitivity to a reduction in MPR is more pronounced with a moderate 
      stress, of a 25% reduction, leading to possible downgrades across all 
      classes. The harshest scenario assumes both stresses occur 
      simultaneously. The severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades 
      to all classes.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with all 
      performance metrics within Fitch's initial expectations. For further 
      discussion of Fitch's sensitivity analysis, please see the presale 
      report related to the transaction listed above.
    

      The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Cabela’s Credit Card
      Master Note Trust’s asset-backed notes, series 2015-II, as follows:
    

      –$240,000,000 class A-1 fixed-rate ‘AAAsf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$100,000,000 class A-2 floating-rate ‘AAAsf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$32,000,000 class B fixed-rate ‘A+sf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$17,000,000 class C fixed-rate ‘BBB+sf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$11,000,000 class D fixed-rate ‘BB+sf’; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch’s ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool, available
      credit enhancement, World’s Foremost Bank’s underwriting and servicing
      capabilities, and the transaction’s legal and cash flow structures,
      which employ early redemption triggers.
    

      The transaction structure is similar to series 2015-I, with credit
      enhancement totalling 15% for class A, credit enhancement of 7% for the
      class B, credit enhancement of 2.75% plus an amount from a spread
      account for the class C, and credit enhancement of an amount from a
      spread account for the class D notes only.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a
      reduction in monthly payment rate (MPR), and 3) a combination stress of
      higher defaults and lower MPR.
    

      Increasing defaults alone has the least impact on rating migration even
      in the most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating
      sensitivity to a reduction in MPR is more pronounced with a moderate
      stress, of a 25% reduction, leading to possible downgrades across all
      classes. The harshest scenario assumes both stresses occur
      simultaneously. The severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades
      to all classes.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with all
      performance metrics within Fitch’s initial expectations. For further
      discussion of Fitch’s sensitivity analysis, please see the presale
      report related to the transaction listed above.
    

      The presale report is available at ‘www.fitchratings.com‘.
      For more information about Fitch’s comprehensive subscription service

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to
      this rating action.
