Boomkat Product Review:
Rustically off-kilter, cinematic themes played on a prepared Beckstein Model 9 upright piano
“While not a concept album in the strict sense of the term, the album’s title refers to a hypothetical imagining of ‘Mitochondrial Eve’, the theorised matrilineal ancestor of all living humans, reincarnated in today’s world of restricted movement. Threads inspired by this juxtaposition of division and connectedness run through the album, which drifts from plaintive piano-led passages to brisk chamber music and back again, tied together by the textured layering of found sounds and instruments that distinguishes Thomas’s music.
After tracking down an old Bechstein Model 9 upright piano for ‘Asylum For Eve’, Thomas set about modifying and preparing it with cardigans, screws and nails in order to provide the textures and timbres which characterise the album’s dense, affecting sound. Techniques employed for the album include the intricate layering of bowed guitars and ukuleles, and fingerpicked violins, banjo and charango. It’s processes such as these, coupled with Hill’s high quality composition and musicianship, that see the album at once expansive and intimate. Naturally, much of ‘Asylum for Eve’ calls to mind the universe of soundtrack composition, particularly the delicate scores of Gustavo Santaolalla and Thomas Newman. But while the fluttering, layered guitars of ‘Porpita Porpita’ and the title track might bear a passing resemblance to the former composer’s work, Thomas locates these influences in the broader contexts of both his own musical trajectory and that of the wider genre of neo-classical music.”

        Payment Security
      

        We take the security of our website and of your transactions
        extremely seriously.  We encrypt all traffic involving personal
        data with industry-standard SSL certificates and we are also
        PCI compliant - meaning that we follow all current data security
        standards and undergo weekly scans monitoring our security status. 
      

        Additionally, we do not store any card details at all, all
        payments are handled using a system of Tokenisation which is
        an industry-standard method of secure payment handling. When
        you place an order with us payment is either handled via your
        Paypal account or if you choose to pay by credit/debit card we
        create a "Token" with your payment details which is stored by
        the Bank payment gateway. When you return to make a purchase
        it basically reactivates the "Token" so no details need to be
        entered again and those details are not stored by us.

        Estimated Shipping Dates
      

        Estimated shipping dates are accurate to the best of our
        knowledge, based on the latest stock information made available
        to us from the supplier. Available items should ship to you within
        the time-frame indicated. If there are any unforeseen issues with

        Shipping FAQs
      

        Free Shipping: We offer free postage on orders over
        £50.00 to the UK sent via Royal Mail.*
      

        *To qualify for free postage the order must be sent as one package.
        Therefore, all items must be in stock or you should be happy to wait
        until all items become available to ship so they can be sent as one
        package. Downloads and Gift Vouchers do not count towards free
        shipping. Please note that Pre-Orders do not count towards free
        shipping as their release dates are liable to fluctuate.
      
Stock Status

        If your order contains items that have different estimated
        shipping dates (for example, ‘available to pre-order’, ‘in stock’,
        ‘available to ship in 1-3 days’) you will be given an option either
        to wait for everything to become available to ship in one package,
        or to ship each item as soon as it becomes available.  Stock arrives
        at the office throughout the day so the stock status of items on the
        website can change several times a day.
      

        Important Note: all items that are not currently displaying as
        In Stock need to be ordered in from our suppliers and the estimated
        shipping dates are only an indication of when we expect those items
        to come into stock. If there are any unforeseen issues with
        availability we will notify you immediately.
      
Premium Packaging

        At checkout you are able to select a premium packaging option
        for a fee of £1.50. We pack all of our orders using appropriate
        packaging, however when you pick this option we use a wider
        cruciform offering additional protection if you have a
        particularly heavy-handed postman.
      
UK and International Shipping Options

        We offer two services:
      

        1.  First Class Royal Mail - for UK and for International
        orders: The package will be delivered by your national postal service.
      

        Royal Mail sets limits on the weight of packages, so if the order
        becomes too heavy to ship in one package the order will be split
        into two or more packages. The packages will be marked accordingly,
        for example, if an order has to be sent over two packages the packages
        would be labelled ‘1 of 2’ and ‘2 of 2’.
      

        2. Parcelforce tracked courier service:
      

        This comprises a flat box fee for UK (and some European countries),
        and a sliding scale based on weight for other countries. Parcelforce
        is a Monday - Friday service. Packages sent via Parcelforce can be
        tracked here:
        http://www.parcelforce.com/track-trace


        Parcelforce can only ship to PO boxes in certain countries,
        details can be found once you have made your country selection
        at checkout.
      

        Once you have added items to your crate you can select your
        country and choose either to send everything in one package or
        to ship as soon as the items become available. At this point the
        total given is a guide to the cost and more shipping configurations
        are available once you have logged in and proceeded to checkout.
        At the checkout you will still be able to add or take away items
        from the crate and change/compare your shipping options.
      

        Pre-orders are treated as separate packages to items that are
        either in stock or available to order. If pre-orders share the
        same release date then they can be ordered and shipped together.
        However pre-order release dates are liable to change, if you have
        ordered two pre-orders with the same date to ship together and
        then one release date gets pushed back, we will ship the available
        pre-order straight away and the second pre-order as soon as it
        becomes available with no extra shipping charge.
      

        If you choose to ship your order across more than one package you
        can select the Royal Mail service for one package and Parcelforce
        courier for the other.
      

        Exceptions:
      

        * if an individual item weighs more than 2kg and you are outside
        of the UK the package must be sent via courier as Royal Mail sets
        a 2kg limit on packages.
      

        * Royal Mail covers postage all countries, however Parcelforce is
        not available in every country.
      
Missing Packages

        If an order does not arrive, we can issue a replacement package.
        In the UK we consider a package to be missing after 15 working
        days. Most international orders are considered missing after 25
        working days with the exception of France, South America and Africa
        - packages to these destinations are considered missing after 60
        working days. Before we can issue a replacement, customers must
        have checked with their local depot/sorting office to see if their
        package is awaiting pick up. If we think there is an issue with
        the shipping address, or that packages are being stolen in the
        post, we reserve the right to refuse future orders to these
        addresses.
      
Insurance

        We automatically add an insurance supplement to orders over £30. 
        Orders between £30 - £49.99 are charged a 60p insurance supplement.
        Orders over £50 are charged a £3 insurance supplement.
      
Returned Packages

        If a package is returned to us because of an incomplete address,
        or because it was not collected from a local depot, we will have to
        charge you again in order to re-send it.  We will get in touch with
        you before any package is re-sent.
      
Delivery Times

        The delivery times below are estimates.  A lot depends on the

        Stock Status
      

        Physical Products have different types of stock availability, for example:

        In Stock (Ready to ship)
        Pre-Order with estimated shipping dates
        Available to Order (Estimated shipping between 1-3 working days)
        Available to Order (Estimated shipping between 3-7 working days)
        Available to Order (Estimated shipping between 7-14 working days)

        If your order contains items that have different estimated shipping
        dates you will be given an option either to wait for everything to
        become available to ship in one package, or to ship each item as soon
        as it becomes available. Stock arrives at the office throughout the
        day so the stock status of items on the website can change several
        times a day.

        Important Note: all items that are not currently displaying as In Stock
        need to be ordered in from our suppliers and the estimated shipping
        dates are only an indication of when we expect those items to come
        into stock. If there are any unforeseen issues with availability we
        will notify you immediately.

The Digital Entities do not warrant, guarantee, or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the Products with respect to performance, accuracy, reliability, security capability or otherwise. You will not hold any Digital Entity responsible for any damages that result from you accessing the Service or using the Products including, but not limited to, damage to any computer, software or systems or portable devices you use to access the same. No oral or written information or advice given by any person shall create a warranty in any way whatsoever relating to any of the Digital Entities. 
         
        Digital makes no warranty that any particular CD burner or portable device will be compatible with the software used to download Music Content or other material or that any CD burned using the software to download the Music Content or other material will function in all CD players. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your system(s) will function correctly.

        Under no circumstances shall any Digital Entity be liable for any unauthorised use of the Service, Music Content or any other materials.

        Under no circumstances shall any Digital Entity be liable to you for any consequential, incidental or special damages (including damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, and the like) arising out of the use of or inability to use the Products, even if the Digital Entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

        The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored
        at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may
        also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us
        or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other
        things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment
        details and the provision of support services. By submitting your
        personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
        We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
        data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy,
        all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.
      

        We take the security of our website and of your transactions
        extremely seriously.  We encrypt all traffic involving personal
        data with industry-standard SSL certificates and we are also PCI
        compliant - meaning that we follow all current data security
        standards and undergo weekly scans monitoring our security status.
      

        Additionally, we do not store any card details at all, all payments
        are handled using a system of Tokenisation which is an
        industry-standard method of secure payment handling. When you place
        an order with us payment is either handled via your Paypal account
        or if you choose to pay by credit/debit card we create a "Token"
        with your payment details which is stored by the Bank payment gateway.
        When you return to make a purchase it basically reactivates the
        "Token" so no details need to be entered again and those details
        are not stored by us.
      

        Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password
        which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are
        responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you
        not to share a password with anyone.
      

        Although we will always do our best to protect your personal data, we
        cannot 100% guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site
        due to the nature of the internet. Any transmission is at your own risk,
        but once we have received your information, we will always use strict
        procedures and security protocols to try to ensure the safety of that
        information.
