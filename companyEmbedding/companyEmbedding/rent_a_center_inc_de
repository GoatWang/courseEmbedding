	Exhibit 99.1




	Rent-A-Center, Inc. Reports February Key Operating Metrics









	Plano, Texas, March 16, 2017


	--


	Rent-A-Center, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ/NGS: RCII) today announced the following key operating metrics for its Core U.S. and Acceptance NOW businesses for February 2017:









	Core U.S.













	•






	Same Store Sales: (16.0%)
















	•






	Delinquencies: 7.5% and 180 basis points favorable versus prior month
















	•






	Average Monthly Rate of New Agreements: 4.1% unfavorable versus prior year
















	•






	Co-worker Turnover: 75.6% and 14.7 percentage points favorable versus prior year












	Acceptance NOW













	•






	Same Store Sales: (3.8%)
















	•






	Delinquencies: 9.2% and 20 basis points unfavorable versus prior month












	In the Core U.S. business, February same store sales decreased sequentially due to less merchandise sales revenue from the tax refund delay, lower revenue per agreement when customers paid out early from the higher promotional activity in 2016 and generally lower end product in the system, and being open one less business day in 2017 versus the leap year in 2016. The quality of the rental portfolio improved in February with delinquencies coming in at the lowest level in almost three years primarily due to continued improvement in account management execution and stronger seasonality around the tax season.









	In February, Rent-A-Center rolled out a new customer value proposition to all Core U.S. stores. The value proposition is aimed at increasing demand and retention through a more competitive offering. Agreement terms were shortened and an increase in the discount offered for paying out of agreements early will lower the cost of ownership and improve the return on product investment. Rent-A-Center continues to focus on improving its product mix over time to shift to more aspirational product. The Company is taking action to more quickly move through its existing inventory, and the monthly rate and gross profit are expected to remain under pressure. In addition, co-worker turnover has remained consistent since last month but improved year over year as Rent-A-Center continues to add back full time coworkers in an effort to improve customer relationships.































	In Acceptance NOW, February same store sales were impacted by a delay in tax refunds as merchandise sales were down by approximately 15% partially offset by the continued positive performance in rental and fee revenue. Delinquencies continue to run higher and account management improvements are in the process of being identified and implemented.









	Metric Definitions




	Core U.S.













	•






	Same Store Sales - year over year revenue performance on comparable stores
















	•






	Delinquencies - percent of customer agreements greater than 7 days past due
















	•






	Average Monthly Rate of New Agreements - average monthly rental rate for agreements originated in the period
















	•






	Co-worker Turnover - annualized year to date store co-worker turnover

Rent-A-Center, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results

By: Rent-A-Center |  0 Shares     22 Reads
Sequential Improvements Highlight Progress on Strategic Plan
PLANO, Texas - July 26, 2017 - (BUSINESS WIRE) - Rent-A-Center, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ/NGS: RCII) today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
“We continued to make progress executing our strategic plan during the second quarter, delivering sequential improvements in same store sales in both the Core U.S. and Acceptance Now businesses. While we are on a positive trajectory, given the portfolio nature of the business it will take time for the results to fully materialize,” said Mark Speese, Chief Executive Officer of Rent-A-Center. “A number of new initiatives were implemented during the quarter which are expected to continue our positive momentum by further improving execution and enhancing the customer experience. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to fully realize the value creation opportunities of our strategic plan and we will continue to take actions that we believe are in the best interests of our stockholders.”
Progress on Strategic Plan
During the second quarter of 2017, Rent-A-Center saw improved results following the execution of several targeted initiatives. The new value proposition, which was implemented in the first quarter, continued to be optimized with refinements across both Company operated domestic segments. In the Core U.S. segment, an employee co-worker profit sharing program was implemented to reinforce the focus on quality and execution. The Company also improved its inventory mix through a customer-centric assortment strategy focused on aspirational products. Additionally, in order to improve the customer experience, the Company launched a mystery shopper program.

Core U.S. same store sales for the quarter improved sequentially by 230 basis points
Acceptance Now same store sales for the quarter improved sequentially by 380 basis points
The year over year change in Core U.S. merchandise on rent improved sequentially by 380 basis points
Average monthly rate of new agreements for June improved by 5.7 percent versus prior year
Higher end product comprised over 65 percent of product received in stores across major categories for the quarter
Annualized co-worker turnover for June improved 19.5 percentage points versus prior year

Consolidated Overview
Explanations of performance are excluding special items and compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.
On a consolidated basis, total revenues were $677.6 million versus $749.6 million in the second quarter of last year. Consolidated same store sales improved 40 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017 due to the progress made on executing the Company’s initiatives. Diluted loss per share, on a GAAP basis, was $0.17 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.19 in the second quarter of last year.
Excluding special items, the Company’s diluted loss per share was $0.01 and the Company generated $28.9 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue decreased 20 basis points versus the first quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company generated $111.9 million of cash from operations and ended the second quarter with $73.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. On July 20, 2017, the Company paid a quarterly dividend for the second quarter of 2017 in the amount of $0.08 per share and also reduced its outstanding debt balance by $15.6 million in the second quarter. The Company also executed an amendment to its credit facility, providing the Company with the liquidity and flexibility to implement its strategic plan.
Segment Operating Performance
CORE U.S. second quarter revenues of $457.0 million decreased 13.9 percent primarily due to lower same store sales and the rationalization of the Core U.S. store base in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue decreased 260 basis points due to targeted pricing actions implemented to right size the inventory mix and changes from the new value proposition. Labor decreased $19.4 million driven by lower store count and insurance expenses. However, labor as a percent of store revenue increased primarily due to sales deleverage. Other store expenses decreased $17.6 million driven by lower store count and lower skip/stolen losses. Other Expenses, as a percent of store revenue, increased primarily due to sales deleverage.
ACCEPTANCE NOW second quarter revenues of $203.3 million increased 1.9 percent primarily due to the same store sales increase of 6.7 percent offset by revenue declines due to store closures. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year decreased 170 basis points due to lower gross profit on merchandise sales resulting from a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce returned product. Labor, as a percent of store revenue, improved 90 basis points versus prior year. Other store expenses, as a percent of store revenue, increased by 60 basis points primarily driven by sales deleverage, offset by lower skip/stolen losses which decreased by 70 basis points.
MEXICO second quarter revenues decreased 9.7 percent primarily due to lower same store sales. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year improved 30 basis points driven by higher merchandise sales gross margin due to pricing initiatives. Operating profit was $0.13 million.
FRANCHISING second quarter revenues decreased 14.6 percent due to a lower amount of merchandise sold to the Company’s franchise partners and operating profit was $1.1 million.
CORPORATE operating expenses increased compared to prior year primarily driven by incentive compensation accrued at a higher rate versus prior year and higher depreciation brought about by the implementation of the new point of sale system in 2016.

Note: Revised Same Store Sales Methodology - Same store sales generally represents revenue earned in stores that were operated by us for 13 months or more and are reported on a constant currency basis. Under the revised methodology, the Company excludes from same store sales base any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from closed stores or acquisitions. The receiving store will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the twenty-fourth full month following the account transfer. The Company believes these modifications better align its same store sales calculation with the methods used by other rent-to-own companies.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation
To supplement the Company's financial results presented on a GAAP basis, Rent-A-Center uses the non-GAAP measures ("special items”) indicated in Table 3 below, which primarily excludes charges in the second quarter of 2017 for the closure of Acceptance Now locations, incremental legal and advisory fees, debt refinancing charges, and discrete income tax items. Gains or charges related to sales of stores, store closures, and discrete adjustments to tax reserves will generally recur with the occurrence of these events in the future. The presentation of these financial measures is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Rent-A-Center management believes that excluding special items from the GAAP financial results provides investors a clearer perspective of the Company's ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results.
Please see the Company's earnings press release dated May 1, 2017 for additional information related to non-GAAP diluted loss per share excluding special items used to calculate the sequential improvements contained in this press release.

(1) Other charges for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 primarily includes charges, net of tax, related to the closure of Core U.S. and Acceptance Now locations, and incremental legal and advisory fees. Charges related to store closures are primarily comprised of losses on rental merchandise, lease obligation costs, employee severance, asset disposals, and miscellaneous costs incurred as a result of the closure.


 



2017 Outlook
The Company is not providing annual guidance as it relates to revenue or diluted earnings per share for 2017. In an effort to enhance transparency regarding the Company’s results and turnaround efforts, the Company has shifted to a monthly report of key operating metrics (Table 2). The Company believes these changes will provide the investment community meaningful insight into the progress the Company is making on its turnaround.

                Rent-A-Center, Inc. engages in leasing household durable goods to customers on a rent-to-own basis. The company provides the customers the ownership of products, such as consumer electronics, appliances, computers, furniture and accessories, under rental purchase agreements with no long-term obligation. Its stores offer durable products such as major consumer electronics, appliances, computers, and furniture and accessories under flexible rental purchase agreements that typically allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed-upon rental period. The company operates its business through the following segments: Core U.S., Acceptance Now, Mexico and Franchising. The Core U.S. segment consists of company-owned rent-to-own stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico that lease household durable goods to customers on a rent-to-own basis. The Acceptance Now segment offers the rent-to-own transaction to consumers who do not qualify for financing from the traditional retailer through kiosks located within such retailer's locations. The Mexico segment consists of its company-owned rent-to-own stores in Mexico that lease household durable goods to customers on a rent-to-own basis. The Franchising segment use Rent-A-Center's, ColorTyme's and RimTyme's trade names, service marks, trademarks and logos, and operate under distinctive operating procedures and standards. Rent-A-Center was founded by Mark E. Speese on September 16, 1986 and is headquartered in Plano, TX.

Why Should YouRent-To-Own with RAC
Enjoy the best brands on any budget, without having to rely on credit. Yeah, you can do that.


So Much Better Than Credit



                    As a consumer with many options when it comes to shopping, we know the choices can be overwhelming. When it comes to renting furniture, appliances, computers, electronics and smartphones, Rent-A-Center is your best choice. Rent-A-Center does not require credit. We do not lock you into long contracts. And, you can cancel anytime.*
                




                        Rent-A-Center is a resource for whether you need us to temporarily replace a washer that's in the repair shop, or would like to rent-to-own your kid's laptop for college, we are always here to help.
                    





See for yourself how Rent-A-Center gives you freedom, flexibility and buying power that a credit card simply can’t.






Rent-A-Center



No credit needed to get the best brands.


Never borrow, but simply pay as you go on your way to ownership.


Everyone pays the same fixed weekly, semi-monthly or monthly amount.


There’s never a long-term contract. Once you stop paying or you own it, you’re done.


Never build up debt; stop anytime you want. Or pay off early and save on the remaining total cost.


Never goes on your credit report.


Service while you make payments is included at no extra cost.** 


Freeze payments whenever you need;** pick back up when you’re ready. 


Upgrade to newer products and technology as often as you want.** 









Buying With A Credit Card



Your approval depends on your credit rating.


You’re borrowing money from a bank.


Interest payments may be higher based on credit rating.


You’ll be paying on the interest years after you pay off the actual product.


The interest keeps growing, so you go deeper into debt the longer you pay. 


Fall behind and damage your credit, which results in higher interest rates. 


Have to buy additional service/warranty plan, or pay for repairs out of pocket.


Have to keep paying until it’s completely paid off. 


Stuck paying for products regardless of whether you still want/use them. 







                    Choose the worry-free payment option that works for you with no credit needed and no growing interest!
