For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Peninsula Gaming

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Peninsula Gaming, LLC was a casino operator based in Dubuque, Iowa, with five properties in Iowa, Louisiana, and Kansas. It was acquired by Boyd Gaming in 2012.
History[edit]
In January 1999, Los Angeles-based AB Capital agreed to purchase the Diamond Jo Casino in Dubuque, Iowa for $77 million.[1] The company's major shareholders were Los Angeles investment banker Brent Stevens and Las Vegas gaming developer Michael Luzich.[2] The purchase was completed in July 1999,[3] by which time the company had changed its name to Peninsula Gaming.[4]
In February 2002, Peninsula bought a fifty percent interest in the Evangeline Downs racetrack in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana from B. I. Moody for $15 million.[5] They bought the remaining half several months later from William Trotter for another $15 million, plus 0.5% of slot revenues for the first ten years.[6] After Lafayette voters had rejected slot machines at the track, Evangeline Downs had planned a move to St. Landry Parish, which Peninsula carried out. The casino at the new site opened in late 2003,[7] with races following in 2005.[8]
In 2004, Peninsula announced a proposed sister casino to the Diamond Jo, to be built in Worth County, Iowa at a cost of $40 million.[9] The project was awarded a gaming license in May 2005,[10] and the Diamond Jo Worth opened in April 2006.[11]
In 2009, Peninsula proposed building a $150-million racetrack casino in Des Moines, Iowa that would be a sister property to the Prairie Meadows racino.[12] Prairie Meadows ultimately rejected the plan.[13]
In June 2009, Peninsula agreed to buy the Amelia Belle riverboat casino in Amelia, Louisiana from Columbia Sussex for $106.5 million.[14] The purchase closed in October 2009.[15]
In November 2009, the company partnered with a group of local investors in a proposal to build a casino in Fort Dodge, Iowa.[16] The application for Diamond Jo Fort Dodge[17] was ultimately rejected by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, over concerns that the casino would draw too much business from the Wild Rose Casino in Emmetsburg.[18] Criminal charges were later filed against Peninsula and two of its executives, alleging that they improperly funneled $25,000 in campaign contributions to Governor Chet Culver through three of the Fort Dodge investors.[19] The case was ultimately settled, with the criminal charges being dismissed and Peninsula agreeing to pay the costs of the investigation plus a $4,000 civil penalty.[20]
In 2010, Peninsula held discussions with the city of Davenport, Iowa about redeveloping or replacing the Rhythm City Casino, but the company withdrew to focus on its proposed Kansas casino.[21]
In July 2010, Peninsula submitted a bid for the sole available casino license in south central Kansas, proposing to build the Kansas Star Casino in Mulvane.[22] The proposal was selected as the winner,[23] and Peninsula opened the casino in a temporary facility in December 2011,[24][25] moving to a permanent facility in December 2012.[26]
In May 2012, Boyd Gaming agreed to buy Peninsula Gaming for $1.45 billion.[27] Boyd executives particularly emphasized the high growth potential of the Kansas Star Casino.[28] The acquisition was completed on November 20, 2012.[29]
