Overstone Fund Plc
Circular

RNS Number : 9744F Overstone Fund Plc 30 April 2014  

Overstone Fund plc
an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds
Georges Court
54 - 62 Townsend Street
Dublin 2
Ireland
Date:    30 April 2014
This document is important and requires your immediate attention.  If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take you should seek advice from your investment consultant, tax adviser and/or legal adviser as appropriate.  
If you have sold or transferred all of your Shares in any sub-fund ("Fund") of Overstone Fund plc (the "Company"), please pass this document at once to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected for transmission to the purchaser or transferee as soon as possible.  
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall bear the same meanings as capitalised terms used in each of the two prospectuses for the various Funds dated 1 November 2013 and 27 September 2013 respectively, each as may be amended from time to time (each the "Prospectus"). A copy of the Prospectus for your Fund is available upon request during normal business hours from the Company.  
The Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the information contained in this document.  To the best of the knowledge and belief of the Directors (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case) the information contained in this document is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.  
Please note that the Central Bank of Ireland (the "Central Bank") has not reviewed this letter.  
Dear Shareholder,
RE:      Approval of Amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association 
 
1.         INTRODUCTION
The Company is authorised by the Central Bank as a qualifying investor fund and is established as an open-ended investment company with variable capital incorporated under the laws of Ireland as a public limited company pursuant to the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013.  The Company is organised as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between Funds.  
 
The purpose of this letter is to explain, and seek your approval of, certain proposed amendments to the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company (the "AGM").  
 
2.         THE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS DIRECTIVE ("AIFMD")
AIFMD, as implemented into Irish law by the European Union (Alternative Investment Fund Managers) Regulations 2013 (the "AIFMD Regulations"), requires that certain matters be provided for in the constitutional documents of alternative investment funds such as the Company.  It is proposed that the Investment Manager, Oldfield Partners LLP, will be appointed as the alternative investment fund manager ("AIFM") of the Company and will be responsible for ensuring compliance with AIFMD. These responsibilities include, without limitation, meeting with various organisational requirements and conduct of business rules, adopting and implementing a programme of activities and various policies and procedures (which address areas such as risk management, liquidity management and remuneration) and complying with ongoing capital, reporting and transparency obligations.  The Directors are proposing that the Memorandum and Articles of Association be amended to reflect the requirements of AIFMD, the AIFMD Regulations and of the Central Bank in respect of qualifying investor alternative investment funds.  These amendments need to be made on or before 22 July 2014 and so the Directors propose that the amendments be considered as special business at the forthcoming AGM.  
In this regard, it is proposed that the Memorandum and Articles of Association be amended to, among other things:
·           provide for the ability to give preferential treatment to certain Shareholders, subject to the overriding requirement of the fair treatment of Shareholders by the AIFM;
·           provide that the Company may appoint a prime broker and refer to the possibility of such prime broker's transfer and reuse of the assets of the Company;
·           state that details of the size, portfolio structure and investment strategies and objectives of the Company are as set out in the Prospectus;
·           update the rules applicable to the valuation of the assets of the Company to reflect the requirements of AIFMD and the AIFMD Regulations;
·           permit the Company's depositary to discharge itself of liability, provided that the conditions of Regulation 22(14) of the AIFMD Regulations are met, where the law of a country other than a member state of the European Union requires that certain financial instruments are held in custody by a local entity and there are no local entities that satisfy certain requirements specified in the AIFMD Regulations; 
·           set out the accounting rules applicable to the Company;
·           provide that the AIFM will make available to investors certain information set out in the AIFMD Regulations before they invest in the Company; 
·           detail the procedure for the replacement of the AIFM; and 
·           restrict a subsidiary of the Company from acting other than under the control of the Company or any person or entity other than the Company from holding Shares in such a subsidiary.  
Some of the proposed amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association relate to provisions of AIFMD which are not currently applicable to the Company but are included in case the Company wishes to avail of these provisions in the future.  
3.         OTHER AMENDMENTS TO THE MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
In addition, it is proposed that various other minor changes to the Memorandum and Articles of Association be made to bring them into line with current Central Bank requirements.  The other principal changes to be made are as follows:
3.1        Ability to Merge Funds
In certain circumstances, including for example where the Directors conclude that the total expense ratio associated with operating a Fund is no longer economically justifiable, the Directors may wish to propose to Shareholders of a Fund that the Fund either merge with another Fund or merge with another collective investment scheme. In order to be able to implement any such merger an amendment to the Memorandum of Association is needed to allow the assets held by one Fund to be transferred to another Fund or to another collective investment scheme.
The Directors propose that an additional clause be added to the objects clause in the Memorandum of Association to provide for such a power. This change is not being made because a specific merger is contemplated but it is a useful provision to include in case a merger is contemplated in the future. 
3.2        Discretion to Charge Fees and Expenses to Capital
The Directors are proposing that the Articles of Association be amended so as to reflect the Central Bank's current requirements in relation to the charging of fees and expenses to capital.
3.3        FATCA
It is proposed that the Articles of Association be amended to provide for a general authority to arrange for the repurchase and cancellation of Shares in satisfaction of a taxation liability in the event that the Company is required to deduct, withhold or account for tax on a disposal of Shares by a Shareholder or upon the payment of a distribution to a Shareholder (whether in cash or otherwise) or in any circumstances in which a taxation liability arises in connection with a Shareholder's holding of Shares. This amendment is intended to take particular account of the impact of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA") on the Company.  
3.4        Notice for Total Repurchase 
It is proposed that the Articles of Association be amended so that all of the Shares of the Company, or all the Shares of a particular Class in the Company, may be repurchased at any time, at the Directors' discretion on 21 days' notice to the Shareholders. This is now a standard termination provision for Irish funds. 
3.5        Amendments to Temporary Suspension Provisions
It is proposed that the Company be provided with additional flexibility by amending the Articles of Association to provide that the Company may suspend temporarily the determination of the Net Asset Value of the Company and the sale or repurchase of Shares in certain circumstances additional to those currently provided for in the Articles of Association.
Specifically, it is proposed that the Company be permitted to suspend temporarily the determination of the Net Asset Value and the sale or repurchase of Shares: (i) upon the occurrence of an event causing the Company to enter into liquidation; or (ii) in exceptional cases, where the circumstances so require, and where the Directors consider it justifiable to do so having regard to the best interests of the Shareholders as a whole. 
Furthermore, it is proposed that provisions be inserted clarifying that: (i) a suspension of repurchases may be made at any time prior to the payment of repurchase proceeds and the amendment or removal of the Shareholder's name from the register of Shareholders in respect of that holding; and (ii) a suspension of subscriptions may be made at any time prior to the entry of a Shareholder's name, or amendment to a Shareholder's holding, on the register of Shareholders.
3.6        Deletion of the provisions in relation to the holding of the AGM within six month of the financial year end
It is proposed that the Articles of Association be amended to remove the requirement for each AGM to be held within six months of the financial year-end. The Directors propose that this amendment be made in order provide more flexibility for the convening of AGMs. 
3.7        Amendment to Quorum Requirements
It is proposed that the Articles of Association be amended to clarify that, in the event that there is only one Shareholder in a Fund or Class, the quorum at general meetings of that Fund or Class shall be one Shareholder present in person or by proxy at the meeting.
3.8        Discretion to Charge Dividends out of Realised Gains and/or Capital
The Directors are proposing that the Articles of Association be amended so as to provide for a mechanism for the declaration and payment of dividends out of realised gains and/or capital, as well as out of net income as is currently provided for in the Articles of Association.
3.9        Ability to Distribute Shareholder Communications Electronically and Electronic Proxy Scheme
It is proposed to amend the Company's Articles of Association to provide the Company with the flexibility to distribute in electronic form by electronic means any notice or other document required to be sent to a Shareholder, provided the Shareholder to whom such notices or other documents are sent has consented to the provision of such notices or documents in electronic form by electronic means. 
It is proposed to provide the Company with the flexibility to introduce a scheme whereby electronic means may be used by Shareholders to appoint a proxy for the purposes of voting at general meetings. The introduction of such a scheme will remain at the discretion of the Company.
3.10      Other General Changes
It is also proposed that the Articles of Association be amended to update the definition of "Act" to reflect recent legislative amendments.
4.         NOTICE OF MEETING TO CONSIDER AND VOTE ON THE CHANGES TO THE MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
You will find enclosed a notice of the AGM which will be held at the offices of Northern Trust International Fund Administration Services (Ireland) Limited, George's Court, 54-62 Townsend Street, Dublin 2, Ireland on 28 May 2014 at the time indicated on the notice of the AGM. At the AGM, Shareholders will be asked to consider the items of ordinary business set out in the notice of AGM.  In addition, Shareholders will be asked to consider, as items of special business, the special resolutions approving the proposed amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association. 
The changes to the Memorandum and Articles of Association require the approval of the Shareholders by way of special resolutions. This means that at least 75% of the Shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy at the AGM must vote in favour of each of the resolutions. A copy of the special resolutions to be adopted can be found in the notice of AGM.
The precise terms of the proposed amendments are set out in the notice of the AGM and will be available for inspection at the offices of Northern Trust International Fund Administration Services (Ireland) Limited, George's Court, 54-62 Townsend Street, Dublin 2, Ireland from the date of dispatch of this letter until the close of business on the Business Day in Ireland before the AGM. This information will also be available for inspection at the place of the AGM for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.  
 
Subject to Shareholder approval at the AGM, the changes to the Memorandum and Articles of Association will take effect on the date that the Company is authorised by the Central Bank as a qualifying investor alternative investment fund (the "Effective Date").  The Effective Date must be on or before 22 July 2014. Shareholders can obtain information about the date of authorisation on request from the Investment Manager.  
 
5.         PROXY FORMS
The form of proxy accompanying the notice of AGM enclosed with this letter should be completed and returned in accordance with the instructions thereon so as to be received by the Administrator of the Company either by post to Northern Trust International, Fund Administration Services (Ireland) Limited, George's Court, 54 - 62 Townsend Street, Dublin 2, Ireland or by fax to +353 1 434 5273 to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting. Completion and return of a proxy form will not preclude a Shareholder from attending and voting in person at the AGM.  
6.         REDEMPTION OF SHARES
Shareholders who do not wish to remain invested in the Company following the implementation of the changes (if the relevant resolutions are passed) will have the opportunity to repurchase their Shares on any Dealing Day prior to the Effective Date by sending a written repurchase request to the Administrator so such repurchase request is received by the Administrator by the dealing deadline which is no later than 2.00 p.m. (Irish time) on the relevant Dealing Day for all Funds except the Overstone Opportunity Multi Fund when it is no later than 2.00 p.m. (Irish time) by the close of business (Irish time) 10 Business Days prior to the relevant Dealing Day.  
7.         CONCLUSION
The Directors of the Company consider that the proposed changes to the Memorandum and Articles of Association are in the best interests of the Shareholders as a whole and recommend that you vote in favour of the proposals.  Should you have any questions relating to these matters, you should either contact us at the above address or, alternatively, you should contact your investment consultant, tax adviser and/or legal adviser, as appropriate.  
Yours faithfully,
