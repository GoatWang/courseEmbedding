WALNUT CREEK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Central Garden & Pet Company (NASDAQ:CENT) (NASDAQ:CENTA), a leading 
      innovator, marketer and producer of quality branded products for the 
      lawn and garden and pet supplies markets, today announced that George C. 
      Roeth will be named President and Chief Executive Officer, effective 
      June 1, 2016. Mr. Roeth is a Director of the Company and a former Chief 
      Operating Officer of The Clorox Company. He succeeds John R. Ranelli, 
      who will retire from his positions as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, but will continue to serve as a Senior Advisor to the Company 
      and will remain a member of the Company’s Board of Directors.
    

      Jack Balousek, Director and Interim Chairman, said, “Since joining the 
      Board last year, George has proven himself a capable and insightful 
      leader with a comprehensive understanding of the consumer products 
      industry. We feel very fortunate to have someone of George’s caliber to 
      lead Central through its next phase of growth and believe he is ideally 
      suited to work with management to refine and implement the Company’s 
      strategic growth plan. George’s familiarity with Central and its 
      leadership team will allow for a smooth transition with consistent focus 
      on delivering on the Company’s commitments to its customers and 
      consumers.”
    

      Mr. Balousek continued, “On behalf of the Board, I want to thank John 
      for his extraordinary service to Central. He has been an invaluable 
      leader, and it’s through his hard work and dedication, along with that 
      of the entire team, that Central is now performing at a high level and 
      positioned to build on its momentum to realize its long-term growth 
      potential. While we congratulate John on his well-earned retirement, we 
      are thankful Central will continue to benefit from his insights as an 
      advisor to the company.”
    

      Mr. Roeth said, “I have the privilege of taking the reins of a company 
      that is executing well, establishing a track record of delivering on its 
      commitments, and creating value for all of its stakeholders. Central 
      will continue to focus on delivering this value through servicing its 
      customers with excellence, expanding its innovation output and success 
      rate, and lowering costs to reinvest in growth. I look forward to 
      working alongside Central’s leadership team across all of its businesses 
      to execute on these priorities, allowing the Company to capture near and 
      long-term growth opportunities.”
    

      Mr. Ranelli said, “I cannot imagine a better time to execute our 
      succession plan. As I reach 70, we have delivered record performance 
      numbers, both operationally and financially, and put in place a solid 
      platform for future growth. In short, we have a strategy and plan that 
      is working, a management team executing flawlessly, and a talented board 
      member, who we know well, ready to take Central to the next level. 
      George is the right person to be the next CEO given his experience with 
      consumer products and brands and his familiarity with Central. He 
      understands our strategy and culture and has developed a relationship 
      with our management team. I believe it will be a smooth transition, and 
      look forward to continuing to serve the Company in my new role and 
      seeing Central continue to thrive under George’s leadership.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.
