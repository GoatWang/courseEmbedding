SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 


 


         
This SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
the


28th day of December, 2006, by and among WHX Corporation, a
Delaware corporation


("WHX"), Handy & Harman, a New York corporation ("H&H"),
and Pension Benefit


Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"), a United States government
corporation


created by Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as


amended ("ERISA"). The PBGC herein acts on behalf of the WHX
Pension Plan


("Plan").


                              
W I T N E S S E T H:


         
WHEREAS, WHX and H&H are and hereafter may be indebted to the
Plan, and


PBGC has filed statutory liens under 26 U.S.C. ss. 412(n)
("Statutory Liens")


against WHX and H&H on behalf of the Plan and may record other
liens, statutory


or consensual; and


 


         
WHEREAS, WHX sought from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") a
waiver


of the minimum funding standards for the Plan for the plan year
ended December


31, 2005, pursuant to Section 412(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
("Code") and


Section 303 of ERISA; and


 


         
WHEREAS, by letter dated December 20, 2006, the IRS granted such
waiver


for the Plan with conditions (the "Waiver"); and


 


         
WHEREAS, H&H and its subsidiaries ("Borrowers") now are and
hereafter


will be indebted to Wachovia Bank, National Association, a national
banking


association, in its capacity as agent (in such capacity, "Agent")
for itself and


certain other financial institutions (collectively, "Lenders"), on
account of


loans or other extensions of credit or financial accommodations
from the Agent


and Lenders to the Borrowers pursuant to the Loan and Security
Agreement, dated


March 31, 2004, as heretofore amended, by and among Borrowers,
certain of their


affiliates, Agent and Lenders (as the same may hereafter be
amended, modified,


supplemented, extended, renewed, restated or replaced, the
"Wachovia Loan


Agreement"); and


 


 


 


  
       
WHEREAS, to secure the payment of their indebtedness to the Agent
and


Lenders, Borrowers have granted to the Agent security interests in
their


personal and real property, pursuant to various financing
agreements; and


 


         
WHEREAS, PBGC and the Agent entered into the Lien Subordination


Agreement dated as of October 20, 2006, as amended by Amendment No.
1 to Lien


Subordination Agreement dated on or about the date hereof (the
"Subordination


Agreement"), under which PBGC agreed to subordinate the Statutory
Liens and any


future statutory or consensual liens it obtains for the benefit of
the Plan to


the liens held by Agent (the "Wachovia Liens"); and


 


         
WHEREAS, the Borrowers now are and hereafter will be indebted to
Steel


Partners II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Steel"), on
account of loans


or other extensions of credit or financial accommodations from
Steel to the


Borrowers: and


 


         
WHEREAS, to secure the payment of their indebtedness to Steel,


Borrowers have granted to Steel security interests in their
personal and real


property, pursuant to a security agreement; and


 


         
WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement understand that the Waiver


requires that Borrowers provide security to the Plan, acceptable to
the PBGC, as


a condition of granting the Waiver; and


 


         
WHEREAS, the PBGC has requested that, upon the IRS' granting the


Waiver, Borrowers be prepared to grant to the Plan a security
interest,


enforceable by the PBGC, in certain of their respective assets to
secure


Borrowers' obligations under the Waiver; and


 


         
WHEREAS, on October 30, 2006, WHX made a contribution to the Plan
in


the amount of $4,960,000 (the "October 30, 2006 Contribution"), an
amount


 


 


                                       
2


 


 


 


calculated, assuming a favorable ruling on the requested waiver, to
satisfy the


quarterly contribution requirements to the Plan under Section
412(m) of the Code


for the year ending December 31, 2006; and


 


         
WHEREAS, in addition to the matters specifically pertaining to the


Waiver and the collateral for the Waiver, the parties hereto desire
to resolve


certain other outstanding differences, disputes and claims that
each has or may


have against the other, including, without limitation, certain
potential issues


that could arise under Section 4062(e) of ERISA; and


 


         
WHEREAS, the Agent and Steel will require intercreditor agreements
with


PBGC to reflect the priority and terms of each party's security
interests.


 


         
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained
herein


and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which


are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:


 


         
1. The following agreements shall be executed and delivered by the


respective parties thereto concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this


Agreement:


 


            
A.
   
Second Priority Security Agreement by and among H&H, the


                 
subsidiaries of H&H named therein and the PBGC, in the form of


                 
EXHIBIT A hereto, and related UCC-1 financing statement;


 


            
B.
   
Fourth Priority Security Agreement by and among H&H, the


                 
subsidiaries of H&H named therein and the PBGC, in the form of


                 
EXHIBIT B hereto, and related UCC-1 financing statement (as the


                 
same may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed,


                 
restated or replaced, the "Fourth Lien Agreement");


 


            
C.
   
Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement by and among the


                 
Agent, Steel and the PBGC, in the form of EXHIBIT C hereto (as


 


 


                                       
3


 


 


 


                 
the same may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,


                 
renewed, restated or replaced, the "Intercreditor Agreement");


 


            
D.
   
Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement by and among WHX, WHX


                 
CS Corp., a Delaware corporation ("WHXCS"), and Steel, in the


                 
form of EXHIBIT D hereto, and related UCC-1 financing


                 
statement;


 


            
E.
   
WHX Pledge and Security Agreement by and among WHX, WHXCS and


                 
the PBGC, in the form of EXHIBIT E hereto, and related UCC-1


                 
financing statement; and


 


            
F. 
  
Lien Subordination Agreement by and between Steel and the PBGC,


                 
in the form of EXHIBIT F hereto.


 


         
All of the foregoing agreements, as the same may be amended,
modified,


supplemented, extended, renewed, restated or replaced, are
collectively referred


to herein as the "Security and Subordination Agreements."


 


         
2. The PBGC has recommended with respect to the requested waiver
that


IRS include in a favorable ruling thereon that the outstanding
balance of the


waived amount of $15,505,353 ("Waiver Amount") be amortized over a
period of


five years commencing with respect to the Plan year beginning
January 1, 2006


(the "Amortization Period"). The PBGC acknowledges that, to the
extent permitted


by applicable law, a portion of the 2006 plan year contributions
for the Plan,


including, without limitation, a portion of the October 30, 2006
Contribution,


will be applied towards the required amortization of the Waiver
Amount. Each


Plan year during the Amortization Period, upon WHX having paid to
the Plan the


minimum required contribution for such Plan year (which shall be
paid no later


than September 15 of the following Plan year), the unamortized
balance of the


Waiver Amount will be reduced by the interest adjusted annual
amortization of


 


 


                                       
4


 


 


 


the Waiver Amount. Within ten business (10) days after WHX provides
proof to


PBGC that it has satisfied its commitment with respect to the
minimum required


contributions for a Plan year, the PBGC shall certify in writing to
WHX, and


such lenders or potential lenders as WHX shall designate, as to the
outstanding


unamortized balance of the Waiver Amount after giving effect to all
of such


payments to the Plan made for such Plan year. The parties hereto
agree that the


outstanding balance of the Waiver Amount will not be eliminated
solely by virtue


of any provision of or regulation pertaining to the Pension
Protection Act of


2006. WHX may pay, without prior notice and without penalty, all or
any portion


of the outstanding balance of the Waiver Amount at any time and
from time to


time prior to the expiration of the Amortization Period. In the
event that WHX


pays the full amount of the then outstanding balance of the Waiver
Amount prior


to the end of the Amortization Period (an "Early Payment"), (i) WHX
will provide


to PBGC written certification by the Plan's enrolled actuary that
the Waiver


Amount has been reduced to zero (the "Actuary Certification"), (ii)
WHX will


commence as soon as reasonably possible, and the PBGC will
cooperate with WHX,


to seek to have the IRS recompute (the "Recomputation") the
Amortization Period


for the Waiver Amount to reflect such Early Payment, (iii) (A) if
the Early


Payment occurs prior to the 2008 plan year, WHX will elect under
Section


303(f)(5)(A) of ERISA and Section 430(f)(5)(A) of the Code to
reduce any


carryover balance in the funding standard account of the Plan
generated by and


as a direct result of such Early Payment as of the beginning of the
2008 plan


year, or (B) if the Early Payment occurs during or after the 2008
plan year, WHX


will not make an election under Section 303(f)(6)(B)(i) of ERISA
and Section


430(f)(6)(B)(i) of the Code to increase the prefunding balance by
amounts paid


in the Early Payment, and (iv) WHX will continue to comply with the
conditions


included in the Waiver unless modified by the IRS as part of, or
separate from,


any Recomputation. Whether or not the IRS agrees to the
Recomputation, if the


 


 


                                       
5


 


 


 


PBGC agrees with the Actuary Certification, PBGC will take or cause
to be taken


such actions and will execute and deliver or cause to be executed
and delivered


such documents and instruments as may be necessary or reasonably
requested by


WHX to terminate any and all remaining security interests granted
to the Plan


pursuant to the Security and Subordination Agreements, and, at the
request of


WHX, will provide written confirmation of the termination of such
security


interests to any lender or potential lender to WHX, H&H or any
of their


respective subsidiaries.


 


         
3. The PBGC agrees to withdraw all Notices of Statutory Liens that
it


filed or caused to be filed prior to the date of this Agreement
with respect to


the Plan (such notices, the "Prior Lien Notices") upon the
occurrence of the


following event (such event, the "Prior Lien Release Event"): 91
days after the


perfection of all security interests granted to the Plan pursuant
to the


Security and Subordination Agreements (the "PBGC Liens"). The PBGC
represents


and warrants that the Prior Lien Notices attached as SCHEDULE A
hereto


constitute all of the Prior Lien Notices that have been filed with
respect to


the Plan. The PBGC agrees that, at all times prior to the effective
date of the


Intercreditor Agreement or, if later, the occurrence of the Prior
Lien Release


Event, the priority of the Statutory Liens shall be controlled by
the


Subordination Agreement (provided, that, for purposes of this
Section 3, the


term of the Subordination Agreement shall be deemed to be extended
beyond


December 31, 2006 until the occurrence of the Prior Lien Release
Event).


 


         
4. The PBGC agrees that WHX, H&H and/or any of their respective


subsidiaries may enter into a credit facility or facilities, in
replacement of


the Wachovia Loan Agreement, providing for aggregate borrowings of
up to $100


million (the "Existing Debt Level"), which replacement credit
facility(ies) may


 


 


                                       
6


 


 


 


include an amendment to the Wachovia Loan Agreement (any such
credit facility or


facilities, a "Replacement Credit Facility"); provided, that, with
the prior


written consent of the PBGC (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or


conditioned), the borrowings under such Replacement Credit Facility
may be


increased to up to $125 million in connection with H&H's (or
any of its


subsidiaries') acquisition and operation of the roofing company
previously


discussed with the PBGC. In connection with any such Replacement
Credit


Facility, WHX, H&H and/or any of their respective subsidiaries
may grant to the


lender(s) thereunder a first priority security interest in any or
all of their


respective assets (collectively, the "Replacement Lender Liens"),
subject to


Section 5 below (which limits the amount of first priority senior
secured


indebtedness that may be incurred by WHX pursuant to a Replacement
Credit


Facility to an amount equal to the Existing Debt Level). In
connection with the


closing of any such Replacement Credit Facility, t

How does this work?









Frequently asked Questions (FAQ)




What is the Farmskins.com?




Farmskins.com its a site where you can open cases online, just like you would do it in CS:GO.
However, it's a lot  cheaper to open cases on Farmskins.com than through CS:GO.
We also have a higher drop-rate for expensive skins and some exlusive cases.






How can i open a case?





Login with your Steam account.
Click on your profile image, top right.
Add and save your steam trade offer URL.
Click on plus button, top right.
Add money to your account with G2A Pay - enter amount and click on add funds.
Choose a case which you want to buy, click on the case and then choose "Open Case".

Our algorithm will randomly pick an item for you and you will see a notification overlay which will show you the item you have won.

Notice:
Before you will open cases please verify that you are able to trade items with steam users and your steam inventory privacy is set to Public.
You can check it by sending a trade offer to a friend.






Where can I find my Steam Trade URL?




First, you need to have correct profile settings on your Steam Account.

Go to your Steam profile and click on the “Edit Profile” button on the right side.
Then click on the “My Privacy Settings” on the right side.
Under “Profile Status” and “Inventory”, choose “Public – Viewable by anyone on the World-Wide Web”.
Then click the “Save Changes” on the bottom of the page.

After that please open your steam trade offers page:
https://steamcommunity.com/id/me/tradeoffers/privacy#trade_offer_access_url
At the sub-item "Third-Party Sites" you will find your Steam Trade Offers URL.
Please Note:
Whenever you create a new Trade URL, your old one will be useless.
Please don't forget to update it on our site when you do change it.

To learn more about trade offers please read this steam article:
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2178-QGJV-0708
At the sub-item "Third-Party Sites" you will find your Steam Trade Offers URL.






How can i redeem my G2A code?




Click on plus button, under your profile image, top right
Choose a "Redeem g2a code" option and enter the code that you have received (You will be automatically redirected to the correct case).






How can i withdraw skins that i have won?




Go to your Farmskins.com profile page and click on "ACCEPT" button.
You will receive your items via trade offer, which you can find here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/me/tradeoffers
You just have to accept the trade request from our bot.
Please note:
Due to Steam restrictions, you will have to set your inventory visibility to "public" before to be able recieve a trade offer.
Also please verify that your steam trade offer url is working properly and your steam account doesnt have any trade limitations.






I didn't received any trade offers after i pressed on accept button. What should i do?




Its usually happens when you cannot receive a trade offers. You can check it by sending a trade offer to a friend.
There are a few different reasons why you may be unable to trade items.
The reason is typically shown when you try to initiate a trade with a steam user.

Steam Guard Not Enabled
Valve require Steam Guard (via email or mobile authenticator) to be enabled for 15 days to help protect your items and Steam Wallet funds from being misused by someone who may have illicitly obtained your password. If you have not had Steam Guard enabled for 15 days, you will be unable to trade items with steam users. Accounts that currently have Steam Guard disabled will be unable to trade.

Recent Password Reset
If you forget your password and need to reset it (note: this is different than changing your password), you will be restricted from trading and the Community Market for 7 days. If your account has not had any activity for more than two months, these restrictions will apply for 30 days.

Newly Authorized Device
If you are logging onto Steam from a device that has not been previously authorized by Steam Guard (log in confirmed via email), you will not be able to trade from this device for 7 days. Any other devices that have already been authorized for at least 7 days will still be able to trade items with Steam users.

VAC Ban
If a VAC Ban, cooldown or overwatch ban has been registered on your account, you will no longer have access to the CS:GO store, or be able to make trades for CS:GO items.

Steam inventory is "Private"
To be able trade items with steam users - your steam inventory privacy setting should be set to "Public". You can change it by editing your steam profile settings.

Here is the Steam "Trading and Market Restrictions" article about it:
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1047-edfm-2932

If you do able to trade items with steam users and you didnt received a trade offer after pressing on "ACCEPT" button - please contact us via email: [email protected] or LiveChat.
Please dont forget to provide information about your issue, including a Farmskins Profile Url (example http://farmskins.com/en/user/1051233), a screenshot of a issue and a full description.






How do i use a affiliate\promotional code?




If you got an affiliate or promotional code - you can use it by pressing on a plus button under your profile image.
After that please choose a promocode option and enter your code.






I got an error when im trying to enter a affiliate code.




You only can use affiliate code when you are:

Didn't have any referrals attached to you.
Didn't used an affiliate code before.
Didn't opened a case before (incl. Daily bonus case).







I have filled up balance via G2A Pay but money didn't come. What to do?




Your payment may be delayed for 5-30 minutes. Don't panic, its a usual thing for online wordwide transactions.
If your account was not refiled within an hour, please contact the support and provide following information:

Transaction ID: Your transaction code
Payment transaction ID: Your payment digital code

That information can be found at payment confirmation email.
Open an a receipt email from G2A, and copy url of "rate this transaction" button. It contains a Payment Transaction ID unique number.
Contact support via live chat or e-mail: [email protected] or LiveChat.






My skins are auto sold, why?




If you don't withdraw items within 16 days, they will be sold and credited back to your balance.
Items that has quality: Consumer, Industrial, Mil-Spec, Restricted will be sold to the balance after 2 hours.

Sorry, but in this cause we can't revert your CS:GO items back.






Do I need to deposit before I can withdraw on farmskins.com?




Yes, you must deposit to your balance at least once with either G2A Pay or Skin2Pay to enable withdrawal. Minimum deposit amount is $3.






Someone claims that he is a Farmskins Admin\Moderator. Whats going on?

A subject of your email should be: Youtube\Twitch Sponsorship
Please use your business email adress for that.
Don't forget to include your channel URL and demographic information.






I got a error during payment proccess, how can i fix it?




If you received an error directly from system during the checkout process, the issue is with the bank account you are trying to use.
If the message originated from the G2A checkout page, the issue is that our checkout system is not able to start the checkout with this method - in this case we always advise checking all the details of the payment method you have provided and trying to do the checkout using Incognito mode or deleting the cookies from your browser. Alternatively you can also check some other payment method, like for example Paysafecard, to make sure that the issue is only with this one payment source.

If you still cannot use a G2A Pay system - please open a ticket on a G2A Support hub about that: https://supporthub.g2a.com






How can I join a Farmskins Club?




You can join Farmskins club by adding a Farmskins.com to your steam nickname.

When an agreement is made without adjudication during an impending lawsuit, a settlement agreement lays out the terms of agreement between the parties. The parties (''Plaintiff'') and (''Defendant'') will come to an agreement on how they will cease the actions of the lawsuit.Settlement agreements enable opposing parties to bypass a lengthy court process by agreeing to specific terms and conditions which may include relief to plaintiff, method of payment (if any), attorney fees and other incurred costs.These agreements almost always contain confidentiality agreements, wherein the plaintiff of the lawsuit agrees to not disclose any details concerning the nature of the settlement to the press or other individuals.  A settlement agreement may be used in a divorce case or civil lawsuit.
