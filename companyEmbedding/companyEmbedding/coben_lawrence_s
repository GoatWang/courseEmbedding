Archaeology/cultural heritage career[edit]
Coben is a consulting scholar and archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the founder and Executive Director of the Sustainable Preservation Initiative . His most recent work focuses on Inca imperial strategy and the archaeology of performance.[1] He directs a multidisciplinary archaeological project in the Canete Valley of Peru and was director of a project at the monumental site of Incallajta in Bolivia.[2] With Takeshi Inomata, he co-authored the book Archaeology of Performance: Theater, Power and Community. Richard Schechner described this work as "an important work integrating performance theory, forensics, and classical archaeology to describe and analyze not a “dead past” but pasts that continue to operate as rich repositories of living behaviors." [3][4] Coben has published articles on the Inca, archaeological site museums,[5] and the role of performance and spectacle in ancient society. Coben recently delivered a TED talk about SPI entitled "Build Futures, Save Pasts".
He also runs the aforementioned Sustainable Preservation Initiative ("SPI). SPI preserves the world's cultural heritage by providing sustainable economic opportunities to poor communities where endangered archaeological sites are located. SPI believes the best way to preserve cultural heritage is creating or supporting locally owned businesses whose success is tied to that preservation. SPI’s grants provide a TWO for ONE benefit: they provide transformative economic opportunities for local residents while saving sites for future generations to study and enjoy. SPI's paradigm, designed by Coben, has been suggested by the Milken Institute as an optimal solution to preserve and develop Israel's cultural heritage[6][7]
Coben is an expert member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Archaeological Heritage Management ("ICAHM"). He is Chairman of ICAHM's Nominations Assistance Committee and Vice Chairman of its Standards Board.[8] He was recently named to the jury of the prestigious Cotsen Prize in Archaeology[9]
Energy career[edit]
In addition to his academic work in archaeology, Coben has started and run numerous energy companies. He is Chairman of the Board of NRG Energy.[10] He is founder and CEO of Tremisis Energy Corporation and was CEO of Tremisis's two eponymous publicly traded affiliates. Coben serves on the Board of Freshpet,[11] and was an Advisory Partner of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Coben was one of the founders of Catalyst Energy Corporation, one of the nation’s first alternative energy companies. Catalyst was #1 on the Inc. Magazine Fastest Growing Public Company List for the years 1982-1986.[12] He served as chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange traded Bolivian Power Company, Ltd., Bolivia’s largest private integrated electric generator and distributor. He was also a director of Prisma Energy and the Chilean utility SAESA, among other companies.
Coben is also an advisor to several politicians and groups on energy policy. Ambassador Dick Swett and he wrote the national energy policy for Senator Joseph Lieberman's 2004 presidential campaign. He is a member of the Department of Homeland Security's Sustainability and Efficiency Task Force[13] and Cleantech and Green Business for Obama.
Coben writes the Larry Coben energy policy and cultural heritage blog for the Huffington Post, and his own blog Energizing America, both of which discuss major energy policy and cultural heritage issues and comment on related news from around the globe.
Education[edit]
Coben holds a BA in Economics from Yale University, a JD from Harvard Law School, and a Ph.D in Anthropology (Archaeology) from the University of Pennsylvania.

Archaeology/cultural heritage career[edit]
Coben is a consulting scholar and archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the founder and Executive Director of the Sustainable Preservation Initiative . His most recent work focuses on Inca imperial strategy and the archaeology of performance.[1] He directs a multidisciplinary archaeological project in the Canete Valley of Peru and was director of a project at the monumental site of Incallajta in Bolivia.[2] With Takeshi Inomata, he co-authored the book Archaeology of Performance: Theater, Power and Community. Richard Schechner described this work as "an important work integrating performance theory, forensics, and classical archaeology to describe and analyze not a “dead past” but pasts that continue to operate as rich repositories of living behaviors." [3][4] Coben has published articles on the Inca, archaeological site museums,[5] and the role of performance and spectacle in ancient society. Coben recently delivered a TED talk about SPI entitled "Build Futures, Save Pasts".
He also runs the aforementioned Sustainable Preservation Initiative ("SPI). SPI preserves the world's cultural heritage by providing sustainable economic opportunities to poor communities where endangered archaeological sites are located. SPI believes the best way to preserve cultural heritage is creating or supporting locally owned businesses whose success is tied to that preservation. SPI’s grants provide a TWO for ONE benefit: they provide transformative economic opportunities for local residents while saving sites for future generations to study and enjoy. SPI's paradigm, designed by Coben, has been suggested by the Milken Institute as an optimal solution to preserve and develop Israel's cultural heritage[6][7]
Coben is an expert member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Archaeological Heritage Management ("ICAHM"). He is Chairman of ICAHM's Nominations Assistance Committee and Vice Chairman of its Standards Board.[8] He was recently named to the jury of the prestigious Cotsen Prize in Archaeology[9]
Energy career[edit]
In addition to his academic work in archaeology, Coben has started and run numerous energy companies. He is Chairman of the Board of NRG Energy.[10] He is founder and CEO of Tremisis Energy Corporation and was CEO of Tremisis's two eponymous publicly traded affiliates. Coben serves on the Board of Freshpet,[11] and was an Advisory Partner of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Coben was one of the founders of Catalyst Energy Corporation, one of the nation’s first alternative energy companies. Catalyst was #1 on the Inc. Magazine Fastest Growing Public Company List for the years 1982-1986.[12] He served as chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange traded Bolivian Power Company, Ltd., Bolivia’s largest private integrated electric generator and distributor. He was also a director of Prisma Energy and the Chilean utility SAESA, among other companies.
Coben is also an advisor to several politicians and groups on energy policy. Ambassador Dick Swett and he wrote the national energy policy for Senator Joseph Lieberman's 2004 presidential campaign. He is a member of the Department of Homeland Security's Sustainability and Efficiency Task Force[13] and Cleantech and Green Business for Obama.
Coben writes the Larry Coben energy policy and cultural heritage blog for the Huffington Post, and his own blog Energizing America, both of which discuss major energy policy and cultural heritage issues and comment on related news from around the globe.
Education[edit]
Coben holds a BA in Economics from Yale University, a JD from Harvard Law School, and a Ph.D in Anthropology (Archaeology) from the University of Pennsylvania.

Lawrence S. "Larry" Coben (born 1958) is an archaeologist who founded the Sustainable Preservation Initiative. He serves as Chairman of the Board of NRG EnergyContents1 Archaeology/cultural heritage career2 Energy career3 Education4 Selected publications5 References6 External linksArchaeology/cultural heritage careerCoben is a consulting scholar and archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the founder and Executive Director of the Sustainable Preservation Initiative . His most recent work focuses on Inca imperial strategy and the archaeology of performance.[1] He directs a multidisciplinary archaeological project in the Canete Valley of Peru and was director of a project at the monumental site of Incallajta in Bolivia.[2] With Takeshi Inomata, he co-authored the book Archaeology of Performance: Theater, Power and Community. Richard Schechner described this work as "an important work integrating performance theory, forensics, and classical archaeology to describe and analyze not a “dead past” but pasts that continue to operate as rich repositories of living behaviors." [3][4] Coben has published articles on the Inca, archaeological site museums,[5] and the role of performance and spectacle in ancient society. Coben recently delivered a TED talk about SPI entitled "Build Futures, Save Pasts".He also runs the aforementioned Sustainable Preservation Initiative ("SPI). SPI preserves the world's cultural heritage by providing sustainable economic opportunities to poor communities where endangered archaeological sites are located. SPI believes the best way to preserve cultural heritage is creating or supporting locally owned businesses whose success is tied to that preservation. SPI’s grants provide a TWO for ONE benefit: they provide transformative economic opportunities for local residents while saving sites for future generations to study and enjoy. SPI's paradigm, designed by Coben, has been suggested by the Milken Institute as an optimal solution to preserve and develop Israel's cultural heritage[6][7]Coben is an expert member of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Archaeological Heritage Management ("ICAHM"). He is Chairman of ICAHM's Nominations Assistance Committee and Vice Chairman of its Standards Board.[8] He was recently named to the jury of the prestigious Cotsen Prize in Archaeology[9]Energy careerIn addition to his academic work in archaeology, Coben has started and run numerous energy companies. He is Chairman of the Board of NRG Energy.[10] He is founder and CEO of Tremisis Energy Corporation and was CEO of Tremisis's two eponymous publicly traded affiliates. Coben serves on the Board of Freshpet,[11] and was an Advisory Partner of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. Coben was one of the founders of Catalyst Energy Corporation, one of the nation’s first alternative energy companies. Catalyst was #1 on the Inc. Magazine Fastest Growing Public Company List for the years 1982-1986.[12] He served as chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange traded Bolivian Power Company, Ltd., Bolivia’s largest private integrated electric generator and distributor. He was also a director of Prisma Energy and the Chilean utility SAESA, among other companies.Coben is also an advisor to several politicians and groups on energy policy. Ambassador Dick Swett and he wrote the national energy policy for Senator Joseph Lieberman's 2004 presidential campaign. He is a member of the Department of Homeland Security's Sustainability and Efficiency Task Force[13] and Cleantech and Green Business for Obama.Coben writes the Larry Coben energy policy and cultural heritage blog for the Huffington Post, and his own blog Energizing America, both of which discuss major energy policy and cultural heritage issues and comment on related news from around the globe.EducationCoben holds a BA in Economics from Yale University, a JD from Harvard Law School, and a Ph.D in Anthropology (Archaeology) from the University of Pennsylvania.Selected publicationsArchaeology of Performance: Theater, Power and Community.

Item Description: The University of Alabama Press, United States, 2011. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. A rare view of a childhood in a European ghetto.Anna Spector was born in 1905 in Korsun, a Ukrainian town on the Ros River, eighty miles south of Kiev. Held by Poland until 1768 and annexed by the Tsar in 1793 Korsun and its fluid ethnic population were characteristic of the Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe: comprised of Ukrainians, Cossacks, Jews and other groups living uneasily together in relationships punctuated by violence. Anna s father left Korsun in 1912 to immigrate to America, and Anna left in 1919, having lived through the Great War, the Bolshevik Revolution, and part of the ensuing civil war, as well as several episodes of more or less organized pogroms deadly anti-Jewish riots begun by various invading military detachments during the Russian Civil War and joined by some of Korsun s peasants.In the early 1990s Anna met Lawrence A. Coben, a medical doctor seeking information about the shtetls to recapture a sense of his own heritage. Anna had near-perfect recall of her daily life as a girl and young woman in the last days in one of those historic but doomed communities. Her rare account, the product of some 300 interviews, is valuable because most personal memoirs of ghetto life are written by men. Also, very often, Christian neighbors appear in ghetto accounts as a stolid peasant mass assembled on market days, as destructive mobs, or as an arrogant and distant collection of government officials and nobility. Anna s story is exceptionally rich in a sense of the Korsun Christians as friends, neighbors, and individuals.Although the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe are now virtually gone, less than 100 years ago they counted a population of millions. The firsthand records we have from that lost world are therefore important, and this view from the underrecorded lives of women and the young is particularly welcome.

Coben, Performances in the premodern communities shaped identities, created meanings, generated and maintained political control. But unlike other social scientists, archaeologists have not worked much with these concepts. Archaeology of Performance shows how the notions of theatricality and spectacle are as important economics and politics in understanding how ancient communities work. Without sacrificing conceptual rigor, the contributors draw on the wide-ranging literature on performance. Without sacrificing material evidence, they try to see how performance creates meaning and ideology. Drawing on evidence from societies large and small, Archaeology of Performance offers an important new ways of understanding ancient theaters of power.  Bookseller Inventory # B9780759108776

Held by Poland until 1768, annexed by the Tsar in 1793, and the leading producer of paint in the Russian empire, Korsun and its fluid ethnic population were characteristic of the Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe: comprised of Ukrainians, Cossacks, Jews and other groups living uneasily together in relationships punctuated by violence. Anna s father left Korsun in 1912 to immigrate to America, and Anna left in 1919, having lived through the Great War, the Bolshevik Revolution, and part of the ensuing civil war, as well as several episodes of more or less organized pogroms - deadly anti-Jewish riots begun by various invading military detachments during the Russian Civil War and joined by some of Korsun s peasants. In the early 1990s, Anna met Lawrence A. Coben, a medical doctor seeking information about the shtetls (Jewish neighborhoods or ghettos) to recapture a sense of his own heritage. Anna had near-perfect recall of her daily life as a girl and young woman in the last days in one of those historic but doomed communities.Her rare account, the product of some 300 interviews, is valuable because most personal memoirs of ghetto life are written by men. Also, very often, Christian neighbors appear in ghetto accounts as a stolid peasant mass assembled on market days, as destructive mobs, or as an arrogant and distant collection of government officials and nobility. Anna s story is exceptionally rich in a sense of the Korsun Christians as friends, neighbors, and individuals. Although the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe are now virtually gone, less than 100 years ago they counted a population of millions. The firsthand records we have from that lost world are therefore important, and this view from the underrecorded lives of women and the young is particularly welcome.
