 Millennial ‘World Deeds’ Becoming a Way of Life
Small business owner Eric Whitaker talks his charitable clothing company, World Deeds

      by Brittany Dandy   
      Posted: April 28, 2015

Advocacy and awareness for change seem to be a rising millennial trend, especially when it comes to their business. However, studies show that millennials’ dedication to changing the world around them  is becoming more like the millennial way of life.
[Related: How One Young Professional is Creating a Network to Connect Female Entrepreneurs]
Recent reports show that small businesses, rooted in social consciousness like, World Deeds Clothing company, owned and operated by 28-year-old Eric Whitaker, are becoming far more popular.
Whitaker founded the company with is his older brother as a means to become an entrepreneur and to contribute to the world around him. Their colorful t-shirt line highlights social issues such a world hunger, homelessness, war and gender equality–with every purchase benefiting someone in need.  Each design is sketched with a cause in mind and bares symbolic meaning. Buying one tee or tank can provide as much as one pound of food for the poverty-stricken.
“We have helped over 1,000 people so far with meals, volunteer work, and donating. The feeling is priceless, “says Whitaker, “I feel like I need to do more and help as many [people] as I can. This is a good addiction to have.”
According to the Millennials Report, millennials are not solely virtually connected, like many baby boomers may like to believe, they happen to sincerely value the role they play in their communities.
While Whitaker does spend quite some time signed into facebook and twitter, as those are his main marketing tools, he says, it came with little surprise that the majority of his World Deeds fanbase happens to be millennials, specifically, millennial women between the ages of 18-24– making up 64% of his social following.
Black Enterprise caught up with Eric Whitaker to talk social entrepreneurship, his millennial supporters and World Deeds Clothing.
Tell me a little about yourself and what it is that you do for a living?
My name is Eric Whitaker. I’m originally from Palmdale California and now reside in Upper Marlboro, MD. By day I’m a General Manager for a fortune 500 company and CEO of World Deeds all the time.
How did you make the transition into entrepreneurship and why?
It was not easy making the transition into entrepreneurship. The first thing I had to do was recondition my mind. For so long I was conditioned to believe working a 9-5 was the only option. To do this I started reading; everyday for a year I read. Back then, it would take a week to get through a book–maybe more– but now a book every two days is the norm. Anything from finance, to biographies about how others have done it before. This was all helping me condition the mind and preparing for this task.
My father always wanted to have a family owned business that brings us all closer. While he said it, I decided to make the dream come true. While I’ve always had aspirations to be an entrepreneur, this extra motivation pushed me even more.
How does World Deeds work and where is your passion within its cause?
World Deeds is clothing with a cause. Every three months we come out with a collection that focuses on a different social issue. Whether it is hunger, poverty, gender equality, or war we want to not only bring awareness but take action. That is why for every purchase we donate to a charity that supports that cause. I have always wanted to help people in some way. I was a peer counselor since middle school and a psych major in college. This has always been my goal in life. This is a way for my family to be involved and make a difference.
Why do you think millennials feel the need to give and remain socially aware?
Millennials have grown up with technology, education, and an unbelievable amount of knowledge at their fingertips. They will be the most well educated generation in history. When you have knowledge you know giving back is the right thing to do. When you have the world at your disposal you have no choice but to be socially aware. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram have made it so easy to get almost instant news from around the world. With knowing what’s going on I believe people want to get involved and be a part of something bigger than themselves.
Why do you believe women have gravitated towards your brand?
This generation of women are givers. We all want to be apart of a movement and we all want to be better than the generation before us. With this brand you can give back and know you are doing something good. You were going to purchase a shirt or a tank top anyway, why not purchase one that also donates a pound of food to fight hunger?
What was your big “aha” moment?
I met a gentleman through my father that owned his own t-shirt company for 15 years. He was a tough guy to talk to and really wasn’t willing to converse with just anyone. I asked him if it was okay for me to get his input on a few things and he scheduled a time for us to talk. I was thinking if he likes the vision than I might be on to something. He was instantly willing to mentor me and helped me with my first sale, which was 53 shirts to a business owner. This was before we had a website, or even the product. This gentleman was so on board he placed an order because it was for a good cause, and I then knew we might be okay.

                                For those seeking the Heathen Worldview this book is essential. Short it may be, but it is packed full of more valuable information than many of the large tomes passed off as 'ancient wisdom'. No fluff or stuff! It goes into language used, context of words, language informs thought! I have ordered over 5 copies of this book and handed them out to my tribe whenever I can. In all my years of being Heathen I regret this book never came into my radar till recent years. I could have saved a lot of wasted time. I would love to see more like this title!

                                This is one of the most important heathen books written, and thank the gods (and White Marsh Theod) that it is back in print once again. Do yourself a favor, read this book, then read it again, and again. This is a book that will transform the way you look at the world and take your heathen practice and beliefs to new levels. I wholeheartedly recommend this work. (Jeff Wolf)

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Bio



Using computational approaches to understand the dynamics and evolution of complex biological networks.
A wide variety of processes in the cell depend on the function of large complexes.  A major focus of our lab involves using computational modeling to understand how macromolecular structures assemble from their component parts.  Our work is aimed at providing fundamental insights into assembly mechanisms with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that could disrupt or enhance the assembly of medically relevant complexes.  The results of our work also provide general rules that can be applied in the design and construction of synthetic complexes that will self-assembly efficiently.
In one set of projects, we are considering the assembly dynamics of macromolecular structures that contain rings.  Many important complexes, such as the proteasome, the chaperonin GroEL, and the apoptosome (which is involved in programmed cell death)       , consist either of single rings or of multiple rings stacked on top of one another.  We have characterized some of the challenges that face simple ring-like structures as they assemble, and have discovered mechanisms that complexes could employ to assemble with optimal efficiency.  We are currently extending this work to the study of stacked rings, with a particular focus on complexes for which there is experimental evidence of self-assembly.  The predictions of these models are being tested experimentally through our collaborations with a number of groups at KU.
A second major focus of the lab involves understanding how cells process information from their environment.  This task is often accomplished by signaling networks in which proteins interact with one another to propagate extracellular signals to the appropriate cellular response.  The structure of these networks varies widely in evolution:  bacteria, for instance, utilize highly linear signaling networks in which a single protein, called the sensor kinase, directly activates a second protein called the response regulator.  In contrast, metazoan networks, like those found in human cells, are generally incredibly complex, with a massive degree of crosstalk between the receptors on the cell surface and the transcription factors that control cellular responses.  Our lab is using a combination of computational modeling, data analysis, and collaborations with experimental groups to understand the evolutionary pressures that have led to such different global topologies.

                    Two bright tenor talents from the New York scene – coming together beautifully here, with one heck of a great rhythm section!  The players are all familiar, but the sound is nice and fresh – thanks to really strong interplay between the tenors of Eric Alexander and Grant Stewart – both driven onward with energy that almost reminds us of a Johnny Griffin/Eddie Davis session from way back!  There's plenty of that older soul on some of these tunes – mixed with a few that have a bit more poise, too – a good balance that's handled well in the rhythms by David Hazeltine on piano, John Webber on bass, and Joe Farnsworth on drums.  Titles include "R&D Bossa", "Crying Blues", "Omicron", "Amsterdam After Dark", and "Rise N Shine".   © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 




Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.




Used CD Grade

    We have only one grade for non-new CDs at Dusty Groove — "Used CD".
    This grade is somewhat all-encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer
    Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play
    without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove,
    you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not,
    then you may return it for a full refund.


    With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of
    surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all.  You can also expect the case to be
    clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we
    handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted
    otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so
    look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.
