Meet Dr. Brett Grossman (and Emerson, and Crocodile, and ...) - Medical District Veterinary Clinic at Illinois

Medical District Veterinary Clinic at Illinois
We get you and your little dog (or cat) too!











Meet Dr. Brett Grossman (and Emerson, and Crocodile, and …) 
By Medical District Veterinary Clinic at Illinois on June 19, 2015 in Uncategorized 

Please join us in welcoming Dr. Brett Grossman, the newest clinician at the Medical District Veterinary Clinic at Illinois!
Dr. Brett Grossman gets crazy while Oscar Biscuit Wilde keeps his cool.Since he started in late May, Dr. Grossman has quickly become a favorite with our clients and patients, including the adorable–and reportedly very food motivated–Oscar Biscuit Wilde, who appears calm and symmetrical with Dr. Grossman in the photo at right.
His own pet family includes Emerson, a ridiculously mischievous terrier/whippet mix that was adopted from a nun in Arizona while the Grossmans were on vacation; Crocodile, a Russian Blue-mixed cat adopted off the streets of Greensboro, N.C., with an unusual proclivity for urinating in the toilet; and Bell, the family matriarch and a hyperthyroid tabby cat adopted from the South Side of Chicago.
“I am very excited to be practicing veterinary medicine in Chicago and helping the Medical District Veterinary Clinic grow,” says Dr. Grossman.
He is no stranger to Chicago. Before joining the Medical District Veterinary Clinic Dr. Grossman provided emergency veterinary care in the Chicago area for several years. And before embarking on a veterinary degree, he earned dual degrees in Analytical Philosophy and Neuroscience at the University of Illinois at Chicago and spent his time playing music and running record stores in the Chicago area.
He earned his veterinary degree from Western University of Health Sciences in California and completed a small animal internship in medicine and surgery at Carolina Veterinary Specialists in North Carolina.
To learn more about Dr. Grossman, see our “Meet Our Staff” page.
