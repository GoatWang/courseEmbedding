ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) Rating Increased to Hold at Zacks Investment Research

Posted by Dan Jones on Jul 21st, 2017 // No Comments 

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a report published on Tuesday, June 20th. 
According to Zacks, “In the last three months, ResMed is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. On the brighter side, ResMed’s product launches and strategies to gain traction in the SDB market are expected to boost its performance in the near term. Moreover, the company’s double-digit growth in mask sales raises optimism. Its recent published favorable study result on COPD is expected to open up new scope in this line. Yet, challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement issues continue to plague the stock. Foreign exchange movements dented third-quarter earnings, thanks to the weaker Euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Rising operating expenses and a weak operating margin are other major woes for ResMed. The company’s last reported fiscal third quarter performance was also unimpressive.”

ResMed Products











ResMed
ResMed is the premiere manufacturer in the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) industry. They produce high-end CPAP machines, masks and accessories that are designed for comfortable and effective treatment of sleep apnea. The company was founded in 1989 to develop a device for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Through the years, they've offered more than 200 different products, from their AirSense 10 AutoSet CPAP machine, the world's best-selling CPAP device, to accessories such as cushions for their ResMed Quattro. 

Their most recent models include their AirSense™ 10 Series, a fixed-pressure CPAP machine with integrated humidifier and seamless cellular connectivity and the AirCurve™ bilevel machine, which provides adjustable set pressures. ResMed continues to be an innovator in the field, which is why the company is one of the most well-respected medical equipment manufacturers.

Whether you choose a fixed-pressure device, auto-adjusting pressure machine or bi-level unit, you'll know that your CPAP machine is of the highest quality to effectively treat your sleep disorder while providing optimal comfort. Their CPAP equipment has comfort features like heated tubing and pressure relief. All the ResMed machines we sell are available with or without a heated humidifier and heated tubing. These features make your device more comfortable to use, so that you can get the best results.

In addition to their world-class CPAP machines, ResMed also manufactures compatible CPAP masks and accessories. At RespShop, you'll find high-quality replacement head gear and cushions for our ResMed masks, which includes nasal, nasal pillow and full face masks. By regularly replacing your mask parts, you'll reduce or eliminate leaks, giving you more effective therapy treatment. 

ResMed is one of our elite manufacturers, hand-chosen by us for their innovative, high-quality and exceptionally well-designed products.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Medical Devices Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Medical devices are durable and disposable in nature.  These devices can be used for a wide variety of conditions for surgical procedures, home health care, clinical settings or in the medical office setting.  A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent or anything similar which can be used to diagnose, prevent or treat a disease within the body.  It can be as simple as a tongue depressor, medical thermometer or disposable gloves.  It can also be as complex as a computer which can assist in medical testing, an implant like a stent or a prosthesis.  Globally, the medical device market is over $209 billion.

ResMed Sees Potential in SDB Market, Eyes Global GrowthHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 1 hr 32 minsS&P Futures2,465.00-7.00 (-0.28%)Dow Futures21,711.00-32.00 (-0.15%)ResMed Sees Potential in SDB Market, Eyes Global GrowthZacks Equity ResearchZacksJuly 7, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareOn Jul 6, we issued an updated research report on San Diego, CA-based ResMed, Inc. RMD. The company is a global manufacturer and distributor of generators, masks and related accessories for treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and other respiratory disorders. At present, the company’s line of products includes airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories.Over the past one month, ResMed has traded above the Zacks categorized Medical Product industry. The stock has gained 3.8% in this period, much higher than the broader industry’s 0.8% improvement. We note that the top line growth was driven by a solid performance in the U.S. Also ResMed’s product launches and new strategies to capture the SDB market have boosted its earnings.ResMed had earlier identified three horizons for future growth. In terms of progress in the first horizon, which focuses on ResMed’s core sleep apnea franchise, the company has been making an advanced technology combined with digital health and connected care solutions.The company has also launched a new series of AirFit F20 full size masks and AirFit N20 nasal masks in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Management expects to witness a strong demand for these products which should continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Among the recent developments pertaining to sleep apnea, worth mentioning is the FDA clearance of ResMed’s AirMini, the world’s smallest continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.The second horizon is growth in adjacent products including homecare ventilation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other respiratory disorders, plus flourishing widely in geographic markets. The key emerging markets of China, India and Brazil top the list.Within the above horizon, ResMed continues to see portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) as an important addition to its menu of respiratory care products. The integration of the Inova acquisition has focused on quality improvements to the current Activox POC platform. Management is making efforts to broaden this technology globally.The third growth horizon incorporates a portfolio of opportunities in new markets, including clinical adjacencies such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, chronic disease management as well as sleep health and wellness.Another key area of this horizon is ResMed’s work on chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice.In the segment of sleep help and wellness, the company formed a joint venture with Dr. Mehmet Oz – Sleep Score Labs. This partnership was initiated last quarter with an entire Dr. Oz show dedicated to the field of sleep wellness, leveraging the S+ sleep wellness tool by ResMed.Significantly in the second quarter, ResMed has generated 10% revenue growth (up 13% at CER - Constant Exchange Rate) in the combined EMEA and APAC region. Remarkably, the upside was driven by solid Flow Generator sales, with a strong performance from the company’s combined Curative and China businesses.Management is particularly optimistic about its mask category to return to public growth in EMEA and APAC as the company continues to launch the N20 and F20 mask series.Read MoreOverall, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is huge and to a great extent, underpenetrated across the globe. Per a 2013 study, SDB affects 34% of men and 17% of women, aged between 30 and 70. It has been estimated that 26% of adults in the age group of 30-70 have some form of OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea), which is the most common form of SDB. In the U.S. alone, this represents approximately 46 million people.A strong correlation between OSA and a number of cardiovascular diseases has been recently discovered. Studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, 72% of patients has type II diabetes, 77% affected with obesity, while 76% suffers from congestive heart failure.Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the medical sector are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. MLAB, Inogen, Inc. INGN and Align Technology, Inc. ALGN. Notably, Mesa Laboratories and Inogen sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Mesa Laboratories has a positive earnings surprise of 2.84% over the last four quarters. The stock increased nearly 10.9% over the last three months.Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock surged around 25.6% over the last three months.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock almost rallied 31.9% over the last three months.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
