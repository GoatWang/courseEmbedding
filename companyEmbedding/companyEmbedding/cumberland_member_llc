Our goal is to support our customers during the development and design phase with part design and material suggestions so that the product will be cost effective and meets the intended design specification.










Cumberland has full tooling capabilities located at our sister company toolCare in Auburn, Al. Two-shot, automotive exterior and interior trim, and high tolerance applications are some of the strengths we  can provide.

A full design feasibility for manufacturing is preformed on every single product to identify any concerns with tool design and functionality.
