With Rose out, Randle continues to prove he's NBA-ready

As Derrick Rose remains in Los Angeles for the duration of his trial, things are looking up for Chasson Randle. The longer Rose is absent, the more likely the youngster is to make the Knicks' opening night roster.
Though anything is possible, it doesn't appear the Knicks are concerned Rose will miss major regular season time. Even so, Randle continues to use the opportunity afforded to him to prove he's an NBA player. He undoubtedly plays the Knicks' desired brand of basketball. The Stanford product already has an aptitude for the triangle, but can still push the tempo. It's a perfect compromise for what New York is trying to do.
Randle may not be a natural playmaker, but his ability to penetrate helps spread the floor. What's more, he's quite the aggressor on the defensive end. Randle is hungry and it shows.
Serving as the Knicks' backup point guard behind Brandon Jennings has been quite the opportunity, and Randle hasn't disappointed yet. Through three games, he's averaged 7.6 points (on 44 percent from the field and 55 percent from deep) and 1.3 steals.
New York may have initially had plans to cut and jettison Randle to Westchester following camp, but he's playing so well at this point that another NBA team would be hard pressed not to pick him up instead. The Knicks may not want to take that chance.
Randle is obviously benefitting from the time and attention Rose has not been able to get in games and practices. As such, he's learning the system and developing a familiarity with his teammates that Rose may not necessarily have just yet. Randle can provide stability at the point guard position, especially as the regular season starts and the team looks to fully acclimate Rose into the offense again. In the meantime, the youngster is showing potential and helping ensure the team doesn't miss a beat.
When Rose returns, he'll obviously be the priority. Nevertheless, having three point guards will also give New York the flexibility to experiment with dual floor general lineups, something Jeff Hornacek very much enjoyed doing as coach of the Phoenix Suns. Initially, it was surprising to see the Knicks only sign Rose and Jennings. Most NBA teams carry three point guards on the roster. Randle has proven he's a big league player and can be depended on in such a role.
Regardless of the reason, Rose's absence has given the Knicks a glimpse into why it is so crucial to have that backup manpower at the one. Rose and Jennings have both fought off major injuries, and should they experience something like that again, the Knicks would be left rather vulnerable having to depend on just one or the other.
Randle should have an inside track at making the roster at this point. He fills a desperate need, more so than Ron Baker or Sasha Vujacic. Luckily for Randle, he's continued to capitalize on the opportunity given. The Knicks need him, and he's given them every reason to believe in him thus far.

Knicks star F Kristaps Porzingis believes New York gives him the best opportunity to win, per The Post's Marc Berman. 
The quote came from a question posed by a camper rather than a reporter. Porzingis attended a Latvian basketball camp of about 250 kids, and he told the group why he doesn't want to leave the Knicks. 
"I feel that it is the best place to win. And if you win in New York, you are king," Porzingis said in his native language. "For the last two years, I have had so many positive emotions here that this is where I want to stay and that this is where I want to win."

A clause in Anthony's contract stipulates that his salary goes up 15 percent if he's traded. Waiving that clause would potentially make it easier for a trade partner to match contracts.

Steve Mills said Knicks had to be 'aggressive' to acquire Tim Hardaway Jr.

 (Ken Blaze)




Knicks president Steve Mills justified G Tim Hardaway Jr.'s pricey contract saying the team had to be "aggressive," per Newsday's Al Iannazzone. 
Many bashed the Knicks for giving Hardaway a four-year, $71 million contract being that he has never been a starter in his career, and spent time in the Hawks' development system. However, Mills defended the deal saying they couldn't pass up on a young guard with his potential.
"We watched him, in our opinion, grow over his time in the player development program that they had in Atlanta," Mills said. "So we decided he was a target."
"We felt like there are not that many opportunities in free agency that you have the opportunity to go after a 25-year-old. We made the decision that if you want to pry a restricted free agent away from the incumbent team, you have to be aggressive. So we made a decision to be aggressive."

GEICO SportsNite: Rondo a Knick?
00:03:27

Marc Malusis and Sal Licata debate whether the Knicks should pursue Rajon Rondo after missing out on Dion Waiters.

 


The Knicks have spoken with free agent PG Rajon Rondo, according to Michael Scotto of Basketball Insiders.
The 31-year-old Rondo was released by the Bulls last Friday. He averaged 7.8 points, 6.7 assists, and 5.1 rebounds in 69 regular season games in 2016-17. His year ended after he fractured his thumb during Game 2 of the Bulls' first round playoff series loss to the Celtics.
Rondo is reportedly also drawing interest from the Lakers.
He has averaged 10.7 points and 8.5 assists during his 12-year career that has been spent with the Celtics, Mavericks, Kings, and Bulls.

With all of the controversy surrounding Phil Jackson, Kyle O'Quinn was not surprised the Knicks let go of the team president, he told the New York Post. 
"It's tough to see anybody go, but I knew a change was going to be made,'' O'Quinn told Marc Berman of the Post. "We didn't know what. We knew something had to be done. That's what they chose to do. I wish Phil the best of course. In any organization, no matter who it is, you hate to see somebody go."
