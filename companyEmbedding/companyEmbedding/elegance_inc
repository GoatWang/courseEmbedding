But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Whittier, CA professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Whittier, CA portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Whittier, CA professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Whittier

FAQ’s - BOUTIQUE OWNERS QUESTIONS ANSWERED                

Q. Is this really my business?

A. Your Elegance Inc. business is YOURS. I know that every Party Plan Company says this but saying it and meaning it are two different things. In my opinion a business is only yours if:
* You can sell it
* You can will it
We allow you to sell or will your business.
If you cannot sell or will your business, one day, whether you retire, you quit or a tragedy affects your life and you can no longer work your business, it gets returned to the Company. So if this is the case, you don’t own it, you are just borrowing it. If you decide to go all out and really make it a success, the day will still come when “your” business ultimately goes back to the Company. BUT NOT WITH ELEGANCE INC! We allow you to sell or will your business! In many other companies, you or your heirs will never truly receive the benefit of all your hard work. If it was yours, you could and should be able to sell it for fair market value, or will it. The choice should be yours, and it is with Elegance Inc.
* You can’t lose your downline for inactivity.
* You can’t lose a person on your Team if they outperform you
At Elegance Inc. you NEVER lose your downline as long as you remain a Boutique Owner. What you have worked for cannot be taken away just because you do not personally sell for a few weeks, a few months or even a few years. We also will never take someone off your Team because they promoted faster than you did. I think the Company should thank-you for finding superstars. With Elegance Inc. you can cheer them on all the way without fear of losing them.
* You are able to sell other brands in other direct sales companies
We allow you to sell other brands while you sell Elegance Inc. even other jewelry brands. It’s your boutique, it’s your business. What right does anyone have to tell you what you may or may not sell? We appreciate the time and energy that you give to Elegance Inc.
We believe women are smart and we respect you, we will never tell you how to spend your time. It is up to us to make Elegance Inc. more appealing to you, with our quality products, our Success Path and the way we treat you!
* You can sell your samples
We allow you to sell your samples and cash and carry. You bought your samples or you earned them, whatever the case, they are yours. We allow you to run your business as you want. We want you to make money in every way you can with us.



Q. Is there a minimum I have to sell to remain a Boutique Owner?

A. No. There is no minimum you have to sell to remain a Boutique Owner.



Q. How much do I have to sell to keep my Downline?

A. Zero. There is no minimum amount of sales that you need to achieve to keep your Downline.



Q. Can I sell or will my business?

A. Yes. It is your business you are free to sell or will it.



Q. Can I ever retire?

A. Yes, we have a special program the 401(e) plan. Please see Complete Success Path for details or speak to your Sponsor.



Q. What is the difference between a Dream Job and Financial Freedom?

A. If you commit to holding regular Trunk Shows you will have a dream job. You will be your own boss, determine your own hours, and you can make a part time or full time living.
With Elegance Inc. since you are your own boss you can determine if you want more; if you do, you can sponsor a Team, coach, train and oversee them. This is the road to financial freedom.
Whatever your Success Path is, we are here to help you walk or run down it!



Q. Do I have to build a Team to be successful?

A. No. The beauty about Elegance Inc. is you define what your success looks like and you go for it!



Q. I heard Elegance Inc. has an emergency leave program, can you explain what this is?

A. Of course. We understand life happens. When bad things happen and there is a major injury or illness in your immediate family the last thing you need is to have is  your income taken away. We have an emergency program that relieves you of your (PRS) Personal Sales Requirement for Paid as Title Qualifications. In other words you will still receive a check for your team and downline without any other requirements. You are family to us, you will have our prayers and our support.



Q. Can I take Maternity Leave?

A. Yes. We want to help make this time a special and as stress free as possible for you. Although you do not need to worry about losing your downline in Elegance Inc. regardless if you take time off or not, we feel that when you are expecting it is not the time for you to lose your income. We have a maternity leave program that relieves you of your (PRS) Personal Sales Requirement for Paid as Title Qualifications. In other words you will still receive a check for your team and downline without any other requirements. Maternity Leave is four months, just fill out the form one month before you are due and relax, we have you covered.





FAQ’s RE: BOUTIQUE OWNER OPPORTUNITY                

Q. What is a Boutique Owner?

A. Boutique Owner is the name we give to our Indpendent Consultants. We see her as a person who wants to make a great living on her terms. I might be bias but she’s intelligent, loves attention and has exquisite taste but still loves a bargain. She knows that working for someone gets you nowhere and not only does she always want to be somewhere she wants to be somewhere great with other great women who share her values. So here she is a Boutique Owner with Elegance Inc. holding Trunk Shows and sharing and helping other women look extraordinary and making a living at it, it couldn’t be better. She loves it so much she shares the opportunity with others and builds a Team of great women. She’s an independent Contractor, and an independent women. The world is a better place with her in it!



Q. Why are there four ways to join?

A. We want this to be the perfect Opportunity for everyone. A church or charity can sign up. A Mother with her 13 year old daughter, a women who wants all the tax benefits a business entity affords her, and the women who just wants to sign up and make it a success.



Q. I’m not really a salesperson. Can I still be good at this?

A. At Elegance Inc., it’s about relationship, not hard sell tactics. Elegance Inc. is a social retail company. If you enjoy socializing and sharing Elegance Inc. products with friends and family, you have all the qualifications it takes to succeed. In fact, it’s the complete lack of sales pressure that makes your business wonderful. Your goal is to help people find the right accessory for them. That piece that’s exactly what they’re looking for and can’t find anywhere else. To book a Trunk Show, turn a guest into a Hostess, and possibly a Boutique Owner doesn’t take sales pressure. They need to fall in love with the product and the personalized shopping experience you’re giving them and their friends. If you sincerely want to help each customer, each Hostess, and your desire is to make every Trunk Show a great experience, then you will be great at it.



Q. What are the advantages of Direct Selling (Social Retailing)?

A. The freedom of being your own boss, the flexibility to set your own schedule and work as many hours (or as few) as you choose, and the limitless potential for success.
Anyone can do it, you don’t need a degree or a background in sales or a big chunk of money for start-up capital.



Q. How many hours do I need to work?

A. It’s completely up to you. An average Trunk Show takes about three to four hours, by the time you set up, take the orders, and tear down.



Q. How much can I expect to earn?

A. The amount you earn depends on how much time and energy you want to invest. Boutique Owners make 25 -30% commissions on all personal retail sales. To layer your income you can earn Royalties on Boutique Owners you Sponsor. Some Boutique Owners just want a little extra pocket money while others are setting a goal of becoming a Triple Diamond Boutique Owner and qualifying for our Millionaire Maker and hitting that seven-figure income.



Q. Are there any scripts to memorize?

A. Definitely not. We would never give you any forced speeches or scripts. We do advise you on how to run a successful Trunk Show, but it’s ultimately up to you how you choose to run your own business. We want your own style to shine through.



Q. What if it doesn’t work for me?

A. At Elegance Inc. we realize that even with the best intentions on both sides, not all partnerships are meant to be. As a Boutique Owner you’re free to leave Elegance Inc. any time. There will never be any hard feelings or cancellation fees.





FAQ’s ON RUNNING YOUR BUSINESS                

Q. How do taxes work?

A. Sales Tax. You collect sales tax at the local rate where you sell product. You then pay sales tax at the time you place your customer’s order in your Boutique Owner’s Back Office. Elegance Inc. will remit all collected sales tax to the appropriate location for you.
Income Tax. Paying taxes on your income: As an Independent Contractor with Elegance Inc., you will be accountable for paying taxes on your earnings. Each Boutique Owner that earns $599 in any calendar year w ill receive a Form 1099 for tax purposes.



Q. Are there any additional merchant or credit card processing fees at Elegance Inc.

A. This is your business and once again you have choices. It is up to you if you would like to have your own merchant service provider (credit card processing system), or use Elegance Inc’s. If you use Elegance Inc.’s there will NOT be any charges.
If you choose to have your own merchant service provider (credit card processing system): you will be charged a percentage on your sales by your merchant service provider, according to your agreement.



Q. Where does Elegance Inc. do business?

A. Elegance Inc. is currently a USA opportunity, and you may recruit Boutique Owners and sell product in all 50 states. Elegance Inc. is NOT currently doing business in territories of the USA or Canada or Mexico.





FAQ’s ON GETTING STARTED                

Q. How much will I need to invest?

A. You can join FREE in our special Work Hard, Play Hard program. For more information please review the Boutique Starter Choices, located on the Let’s Get Started page in the Join Section of this website, or you can discuss it with your Sponsor. If you would like to buy in, you can do for as low as $99.00.  
It was very important to us to have a way for hard working women to be able to start a business through hard work. That’s the American Dream, and it is alive and well with Elegance Inc.  With Elegance Inc. it doesn’t take money to make money, it takes hard work and dedication.



Q. How do I book my first Trunk Shows?

A. Don’t worry, with Elegance Inc. you are in business for yourself not by yourself. You will have a Sponsor that will help you every step of the way to train you on how to book your first Trunk Show and how to keep booking them. You will also have us if you have any questions.



Q. How do I get paid?

A. Again it’s your choice. You can choose to be paid on an Elegance Inc. debit card which is accepted anywhere credit cards are accepted, including ATM’s machines, or you can be paid by direct deposit in your savings or checking account.



Q. When do I get paid?

A. There are two ways to be paid your commissions. You can be paid on the spot- every Trunk Show is a pay day for you. You keep the 25% profit from each sale and send the rest to Elegance Inc. along with the tax and shipping paid by the customers. If you do not have your own merchant account (credit card processing – ex. Square) you can still get paid on the spot on all orders that are cash and checks.
Or you can be paid Bi-monthly. Run your customers credit card through our merchant service account and we will pay your commissions bi-monthly. If you sell over $2,500 a month or are a Paid as Title of Presidential or higher and are receiving 30% commission we will pay your 5% raise monthly. If you build a Team and are receiving royalties, they will also be paid monthly.



Q. Do I need to keep inventory?

A. No. You will never be required to carry one piece of inventory. Your customers order product from you and we ship it to them, it’s that easy. Elegance Inc. is a great business because you can own your own boutique without spending one dime on inventory.



Q. How do I order samples and do I get a discount?

A. For your first 30 days of becoming a Boutique Owner, you can purchase samples at 50% off. Every time we offer new pieces those samples will also be 50% off. We have an incredible Super Starter Program, Success Express, where you can EARN hundreds or even thousands of dollars in FREE samples. Ask your Boutique Owner (sponsor) for details.



Q. Can I sell product/services for other Party Plan/Direct Sale Companies?

A. Yes, we believe you are smart enough to know where to spend your time and how many companies you can represent effectively. We do not believe it is our place to tell you how to run your business. We appreciate the time and energy you spend with us.
We came from a retail world. We sold to Boutique’s, we could not tell them to only carry us, and it was exciting to be up against all the biggest designers and have customers choose us. We are not afraid of competition of any kind. Competition is what our great country was born on.
Please go to the top of the website and read “Why Elegance?” You will be pleasantly surprised how different we are.
