			About Morrison Winton

with WIN MORRISON REALTY


					Agents: Edit this profile&nbsp





					Win Morrison was born and raised right here in the Hudson Valley, growing up in Freehold. Besides his formal education, Win quickly learned that working hard paid big dividends.He was the sole owner of the Snowflake Ski Shop for a time, and has been an antique dealer for most of his adult life. Win even sold automobiles to supplement his living expenses.Win Morrison spent many years as an IBM executive, based in the Former IBM Kingston facility. From this ideal vantage point, he observed how much the region had to offer and how its people and business community constantly fought back against economic limbo. Long before he formed WMR, Win began to formulate ways to revitalize The Hudson Valley.Wherever Win worked, and in whatever field, he always worked with the public, finding his greatest satisfaction came from interacting with others. And so, the transition into real estate came naturally.Opening the Kingston office of WMR in 1982 was Win''''''''''''''''s first step. Since then, the company has grown every year in size, effectiveness and impact. And there''''''''''''''''s a lot more to come.The company is actively pursuing expansion into other locations, both within Ulster County and in other parts of the region.Win Morrison''''''''''''''''s mission to help shape the future of the Hudson Valley, and to help enrich the lives of its communities, grows stronger every year.

                                    Hi Everyone! I am a recent MBA graduate from Schulich School of Business with 6.5 years of strong experience in Technology Consulting for Banking and Financial Services Industry (especially Capital Markets, Wholesale Banking and Order Management Systems). I have worked in multiple core banking projects for clients such as State Bank of India, Dehtscue Bank, Deutsche Equities, Equifax Inc. etc.
I started my professional career as a Developer and moved towards Business System Analyst - Team Lead roles in the later stages of my professional experience. Thus I have sound knowledge of all the stages of the SDLC and PMLC.

Post my MBA I have started working part-time for a Start-up Firm Recright Inc. as a Program Manager where I am involved in all the facets of the business including business strategy, analysis, technology, integration, database architecture, and project management. I am closely working with the CEO and CTO of the company to build a Business Intelligence application in HRMS practices.

I am looking for full-time opportunities in Technology Consulting and/or Busniess Analysis for firms in Bankiing and Financial Services Industry in Canada. I would be happy to provide further information when contacted.

                                    Hello Everyone.
I have been away for awhile,due to illness. I am back and ready to get back to work. Living in Calgary,Alberta, and at this point in time we are in a state of emergency. Calgary and Area is pretty much flooded and 100,000 people have been evacuated. So far I am fortunate and am high and dry. I am working from home office which is good. I am so happy that so far, there has been no loss of life. People have rallied together to help each other and many of us  who are dry are inviting the flood victims into our  private homes. Where there is no room centres have been set up and volunteers are helping out. The army is here to rescue those who cannot be reached.

                                    I cannot recall in my life, ever have knowing a set of twins. Would you believe that in the past four months I have done wedding videos for three sets of twins. Not just twins, but identical twins. And I mean identical.
Adding to that, I took another booking for a wedding video today and for the second time in a month, I am doing a wedding video where the brides name is Samantha and the grooms name is Chris.

                                    Working From Home

A Little Effort Leads To A Wealth Of Success

What would you do if you no longer had to worry about money? Where would you go? How would you spend your time?

If you�re like most people, you rarely stop to think about these kinds of questions. Too busy caught up in the day-to-day rat race, you�ve forgotten the dreams you had for yourself and your loved ones . . . or at least put them on the back burner for �later.�

Meanwhile, your life is passing you by. Birthdays come and go. Days blend into weeks and months, with only the occasional vacation or major life change to mix things up.

You know there must be more to life, but you�re not sure where to even begin making a change.

Here�s a thought for you: what if you could work from home? http://www.lifestylebusinessonline.com

                                    Hi everyone. I have just joined whoswho so would like to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I am from Brisbane, Australia.I am a videographer specialising in weddings. I will of course take on any other event that a client wants videoed.
Filming and photography has been a hobby since as far back as 1968, but it has only been in the last 12 months that I have taken it up as a full time job. This was due to restructering at my last job that made my position surplus. Having worked in the electrical and electronics fields all my life, I thought that this was all I could do, then suddenly I realised - hey, i have a lifetime hobby that i enjoy and have learnt so much about - step outside the square you've been boxed up in all those years and do something different. If you wish to have a look at my website you will find it at www.alloccasionsvideos.com.au
