Excedrin Product Hailed as First OTC for Migraine 
By Smith, Elizabeth A

Read preview




Article excerpt

Excedrin Migraine reaches shelves this month as the first over-the-counter medication approved by the Food & Drug Administration for mild to moderate migraine headache pain. 
The formula, which received FDA approval Jan. 14, is exactly the same as Excedrin Extra Strength (250 mg aspirin, 250 mg acetaminophen, 65 mg caffeine), with the same recommended dose (two tablets at the first sign of migraine, repeated every six hours as needed) and same price. At the FDA's request, Bristol-Myers Squibb gave the product a new trademark, distinctive reddish-brown packaging, and labeling targeted at some 20 million Americans who have migraines each year. 
"Migraine sufferers have never before had labeling specific to their condition, including guidance regarding when to see a physician," said Nancy Goldfarb, a Bristol-Myers Squibb spokeswoman. 
Several national consumer groups and medical organizations have voiced the need for a clearly labeled, clinically proven OTC migraine medication. Linda F. Golodner, president of the National Consumers League, said that Excedrin Migraine's labeling "provides an extra level of education and specific information for migraine sufferers." 
"Two-thirds of migraine sufferers in the United States treat with OTC medications to the exclusion of prescription drugs, and those people, for the most part, do not get advice from doctors," said Richard B. Lipton, M.D., lead investigator for the Excedrin Migraine clinical trials and codirector of the Headache Unit at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. 
In clinical trials, 59% of the Excedrin patients experienced mild or no pain two hours after treatment, compared with 33% of placebo patients. After six hours, 79% of the Excedrin patients showed a response, compared with 52% of placebo-treated patients (see Drug Topics, Aug. 18, 1997, page 22). Relief from associated symptoms, such as nausea and sensitivity to light or sound, was also noted in the Excedrintreated patients, as well as an improvement in the ability to perform daily activities. 
Side effects from the aspirin-acetaminophencaffeine combination included stomach upset, jitteriness, nervousness, and palpitations. "Basically, the side effects were all mild, shortlived, and what one would expect from an OTC product with a combination of those ingredients," Lipton said. 
In making scientific recommendations to consumers, Lipton advises pharmacists to keep in mind that Excedrin is, for now, the only OTC medication approved for the treatment of migraine. However, there are caveats. "Those people who experience headache-related disability or who don't get the relief they're looking for from OTC medications need to be advised to seek medical care," Lipton said. People who have vomiting with their migraines should also see a physician. …

Article excerpt

Clinical research and the consumer's desire for a more youthful appearance is perking up interest in natural skin care and beauty products, according to industry experts at the recent HBA '98 Global Expo in New York City. 
Though natural ingredients have been used for centuries, they have undergone scientific testing only over the past decade or so, said Michael Bishop, president of Active Organics Inc., Lewisville, Texas. Previously, people relied on anecdotal evidence and used such products simply "because they worked," he said. An ongoing quest for the "fountain of youth," along with evidence that one's outward appearance affects one's inward self, have resulted in widespread "antiaging" claims within the cosmetics industry, added Scott J. Norton, Ph.D., a biochemistry and molecular biology professor at the University of North Texas. "It seems there has been a mad scramble for the true elixir that removes blemishes and wrinkles, moisturizes, tones, improves texture, and protects from the damaging rays of the sun-an elixir that indeed fulfills this quest for a more youthful appearance," he said. 
Despite their positive results, many natural products have shortcomings, Norton said. For example, with alpha hydroxy acid, the better the rate of cell renewal, the higher the irritation. Also, the rapid benefits of cell rejuvenation appear to drop off significantly after 20 to 30 weeks of use. "We really don't know for sure how these alpha hydroxy acids work," he noted. Proteolytic enzymes offer exfoliation and cell renewal activity, but their use in cosmetics has been limited, primarily because they can cause skin irritation, possibly from prolonged proteolytic action of the enzymes, he said. 
Acid proteases, on the other hand, are active only under very acidic conditions. "By the time neutrality is reached, they have totally lost enzymatic activity," so irritation from prolonged enzymatic action should not occur, he said. …
