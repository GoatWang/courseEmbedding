“You’re going to collect more than you can do on the laptop. Everything’s right there: camera, video, voice, signature, anything you need to highlight; it’s all right there.”

Project Inspector, TxDOT



"Total time savings in one day: 2 hours. You can spend that time watching your crew instead of doing other unnecessary activities."

Area Engineer, TxDOT



“I absolutely love HeadLight. You get your inspectors who don’t write out as much detail, but they do a lot of photo observations, and when you pair their short writing with the photos, you get a good idea of what’s going on.”

Project Engineer, TxDOT



“IDRs are more thorough, real time is great for viewing daily activity.”

Construction Engineering Supervisor, Perteet



“HeadLight could have saved me trouble on a claim worth $500,000.”

Project Engineer, WSDOT



“Allows me to make decisions from wherever I am.”

Area Engineer, TxDOT

History of Pavia Systems, Inc. - HeadLight






























































History of Pavia Systems, Inc.







Pavia Systems, Inc., founded in 2005, is a software technology company specializing in the transportation infrastructure industry. The company emerged out of the University of Washington’s Civil Engineering Department after years of research collaboration efforts with several state DOTs including Washington, Texas, Minnesota and Caltrans in California. One result of these early efforts is Pavement Interactive which began out of research conducted by the UW and the Texas Department of Transportation in 2001 and grew from there. The end result was a collaboration of nine state DOT’s design, construction, material and research offices contributing to a comprehensive resource for the industry. Today, Pavement Interactive is used heavily by DOT professionals from around the world and maintained by Pavia Systems as a resource and service to the industry.
Company founders George White and Si Katara conducted these research efforts while completing their studies at the UW and Pavia Systems, Inc. emerged as a direct response to industry needs identified.
Through a pooled fund study, the SPTC – State Pavement Technology Consortium- from TxDOT, WSDOT, MnDOT chose Pavia Systems to help them determine how to best apply technology to streamline processes, an initiative today known as e-Construction. The study concluded that the impacts of mobile technology on project inspection proved to provide significant ROI in efficiencies gained, claims abatement and time savings. Pavia Systems designed, built and tested a mobile project inspection solution focused on a DOT’s construction program, addressing the specific business needs outlined by area office personnel and management. The benefits were measured and validated supporting a compelling business case for it’s use and the result is a purpose built tool which we now refer to as HeadLight.
Today the company is focused on helping clients increase project intelligence on transportation construction projects by increasing efficiency and quality of construction projects. The company’s core product HeadLight, a project intelligence platform, has delivered more than 280,000 high quality field observations seamlessly from field to office in real-time. Customers include large departments of transportation, top ten consulting engineering firms, contractors, equipment manufacturers, and industry related materials companies.

Aug 25 16
Pavia Systems unveiled its cutting-edge, construction industry resource database called “Peer-to-Peer Directory of e-Construction Practitioners”. As a service to the transportation community, Pavia has assembled this freely available database to connect community members with peers willing to share their experiences about the various e-Construction tools and methodologies they use. Pavia Systems’ HeadLight software is a form of e-Construction; it allows highway construction inspectors to collect real-time data with photo and video capabilities, track equipment and personnel in the field, upload reference files, and flag areas of on-site concern in real-time.

Companies often underestimate what is needed to help individuals within their organizations to adopt and use chosen technologies. Pavia Systems offers full service, end-to-end implementation and change management support for clients just starting on e-Construction. Their Customer Experience team has considerable experience helping organizations implement successful digitized project inspection programs across North America with highly specialized trainers and consultants who have a background in civil engineering.
