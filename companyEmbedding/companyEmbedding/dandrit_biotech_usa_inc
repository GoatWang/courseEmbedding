“How Do I Get MelCancerVac®?”
        Cancer Information


“How Do I Get MelCancerVac®?”
In order to be released to the general consumer and comply with regulations, medical drugs must undergo years upon years of testing and clinical trials.
However, due to a collaboration between DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc. and myTomorrows, patients with colorectal cancer can obtain DanDrit’s MelCancerVac, even as the drug continues to undergo clinical trials and has yet to be released on the consumer market.
How It Works
myTomorrows provide so-called “Fast Track Treatments”. They describe how this is relevant to patients with colorectal cancer:

The Anticancer Fund, an international partner organization, made a convenient guide for patients with colorectal cancer about the diagnosis and today’s treatments in cooperation with the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO).
Unfortunately today’s treatments aren’t effective for everyone, so the search for better treatments continues.

This is where Fast Track Treatments come into the picture:

myTomorrows helps you to start such a Fast Track Treatment. First of all we arrange that drug developers make their promising medicine available via myTomorrows. As soon as we’re able to offer a Fast Track Treatment to patients, we inform you about this on our website. We always comply with official procedures. This means your doctor has to prescribe the medicine to you and has to submit a request for approval to the regulatory authorities.

Sign up here for myTomorrows and explore your opportunity to obtain our MelCancerVac product to treat colorectal cancer.

Company Profile
DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc. is focusing on the clinical development of a dendritic cell vaccine for treatment of colorectal cancer. DanDrit Biotech A/S was founded in 2001 on the research of Professor Jesper Zeuthen at the Danish Cancer Society (Kraeftens Bekaempelse). Dendritic cells are critical components of the immune system. The ability of dendritic cells to induce a strong immune response is the basis of the vaccine therapies under development at DanDrit. Our expertise in producing dendritic cells from a patient’s blood is combined with conventional production methods to make new and advanced vaccines for cancer patients.
The proprietary technology upon which MCV is based is protected by several issued patents.

MelCancerVac®


MelCancerVac®—Polyvalent Vaccine Targeting Shared Tumor-Specific Antigens
(This page is an excerpt from the Research section “Vaccine Platform”.)
The main product of DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc. is MelCancerVac®, which uses a patient’s own dendritic cells loaded with tumor antigens from the lysate of a specifically selected melanoma cell line.
The melanoma cell line expresses a broad spectrum of cancer/testis antigens (in particular, the antigens of the MAGE family) and has low levels of expression of the melanocyte differentiation antigens. The original cell line used for the selection was isolated from a patient with a long-lasting disease-free period after the removal of a metastatic tumor, reflecting the natural high immunogenicity of these particular melanoma cells. The melanoma cell line has been tested for safety and was found to be free of infectious agents. The melanoma cell lysate is combined with the patient’s own dendritic cells. The method of dendritic cell generation was initially optimized in order to increase the capacity of immature dendritic cells to load the exogenous antigens and present them for recognition by T lymphocytes. The method was also optimized to increase the efficiency of transformation of monocytes into dendritic cells and permits us to produce up to five portions of vaccine using only 200 mL of a patient’s blood.
In pre-clinical studies performed in vitro, dendritic cells loaded with melanoma cell lysate were able to stimulate the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with broad anti-tumor specificity. This demonstrated that DanDrit’s dendritic cell system is capable of inducing an immune response against shared tumor-restricted antigens expressed in many types of solid tumors. The extent of tumor cell death was correlated with the number of expressed antigens of the MAGE family, the main group of the cancer/testis antigens. These data indicate that the lysate of our melanoma cell lines could be used for treatment of many kinds of solid tumors where cancer/testis antigens are expressed in significant amounts.
For information on obtaining the product, see the section “How Do I Get MelCancerVac®?”.

STOP SEPTIC ODORS!











Septic Tank Treatment
          with 600 Trillion sewage digesting bacteria and enzymes are 100%
          guaranteed to safely eliminate grease, sludge, paper and solid organic
          waste. Eliminates the odors and causes of clogged septics, drain fields,
			cesspits, leach fields and sand mounds.














See How NT-MAX Stacks Up Against The Competition!


Why septic tank and drainfield systems clog
Untreated or poorly maintained septic systems can develop severe Bio-Mat (undigested raw sewage) and grime buildup throughout the entire system including
        the tank, lines, cesspit, sand mound, leach field and drain field. This accumulated sludge builds up gradually, causing performance to degrade steadily
		which eventually results in
        drainage failure. Septic tank systems that have not been
        properly treated, or have had a decrease in bacterial populations due to
        everyday cleaners and other common household chemicals, have a difficult
        time digesting and degrading the raw septic sewage that enters the tank. Most systems
        see problems in the drain field where the field lines progressively clog to a point where
        waste breakdown and digestion is inhibited. These lines have small perforations that allow liquids to pass into the surrounding gravel bed
        where they further digest and degrade. 
In trouble systems, the soil surrounding the
		 septic drainage area
        piping becomes extremely compacted with sludge and waste. At that point, the undigested sewage and liquids
        have no where to go, leading to backups, wet spots and odors. As clogging
        continues, sewage waste may leak out of your septic, drain field or even
		back into your home, causing serious septic system problems. Slow
		flushing toilets, raw sewage odors and wet areas
        are potentially a sign of an imminent backup. A clogged drain field can either be replaced (can cost upwards of five to
		thirty thousand dollars), or bombarded with potent sewage eating bacteria
		that will digest the sludge, re-establish healthy bacterial counts and
		get the septic tank and field back into proper condition. Naturally occurring
		bacterial strains found throughout your septic tank system are killed off by the use of many household chemicals such
		as bleach, anti-bacterial soaps and other bacteria killing chemical  products that
		enter your tank via drain lines. NT-MAX Septic Tank Treatment bombards your
        tank, lines and drainfield with over
		600 Trillion bacteria per treatment, reestablishing much	needed bacterial colonies to quickly digest waste and unclog your system.
Using NT-MAX Septic Tank Treatment on a regular basis assures that sludge and bio-mat buildup does not occur
        by digesting and alleviating your septic tank and drainage problems. The bacterial enzymes introduced into your
        system by NT-MAX Septic Tank Treatment are extremely aggressive at digesting waste, are of the highest quality
        and purity and are guaranteed to be non-disease causing and non-hazardous.
		Our bacterial strains are of the most potent and densely populated counts available (see comparison chart here),
		containing aerobic and anaerobic cultures to attack and digest even the
		most compacted soils. To date, our success rate is second to none and our products
		are guaranteed to eliminate all organic matter, bio-mat, sludge and
        other degradable compounds blocking your system or lines. Backed by over 70 years
         of research and development experience, Newtechbio products continue to
		 be the dominant
		leader in bio-remediation and septic system restoration.

NT-MAX Septic Tank Treatment can save you tens of thousands of dollars in repair or replacement
		costs and can have your system up and running in a matter of days. In many areas, septic tank and drain field replacement can run $5,000 to $30,000
		and in most cases is an unnecessary burden on your	finances. If your system is clogged, go with NT-MAX,
		our most powerful Septic
