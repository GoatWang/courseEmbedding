About Monarch | Monarch LP











 






































Monarch Alternative Capital is an established and recognized distressed debt firm, led by co-founders Michael Weinstock, Andrew Herenstein and Chris Santana.  Established in 2002, the origins of Monarch Alternative Capital date back to 1992 when our co-founders joined together at Lazard Frères & Co. to build an industry-leading distressed debt research effort focused on the United States and Europe.  
Monarch prides itself on the firm’s collaborative and team-based culture.  Our philosophy of hiring at the junior level and promoting from within has enabled our firm to build an experienced and cohesive team that is dedicated to distressed debt investing.  We believe that our one-team model, the strength and experience of our team, and the vast network of relationships cultivated over twenty-five years in the industry are distinguishing competitive advantages for our firm. 
Our flexible and opportunistic approach to investing in the distressed debt asset class and commitment to being active in many of our investments are core to Monarch’s strategy.  Our emphasis on areas with limited competition, particularly in small to mid-sized capital structures, our global mandate, and willingness to take advantage of new opportunities in specialized segments of the distressed debt market are essential to the key tenets of our approach.  
As of April 30, 2017, Monarch manages approximately $4.8 billion in net assets under management and draws on the skills and experience of 67 employees, including 21 investment professionals, across our offices in New York and London.

The Reporting Persons have entered into an agreement (the “Joint Filing Agreement”) with respect to the joint filing of this statement and any amendment hereto, pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  The description of the joint Filing Agreement contained in this Schedule 13D is qualified in its entirety by reference Exhibit 99.1 hereto.  On October 5, 2016, the Issuer and MAC, as investment manager to certain funds, entered into a letter agreement regarding board observer rights (the “Observer Rights Agreement”) which provides that a designee of MAC has the right to attend meetings of the Board and in connection therewith receive certain information from the Issuer.  MAC has appointed Tim De Santa, an investment professional of MAC, as the initial observer.  The Observer Rights Agreement automatically terminates once MAC does not have an employee who is a member of the Board.  Additionally MAC may terminate the agreement at any time by delivering notice to the Issuer.  The terms of the Observer Rights Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.2, are incorporated herein by reference.
