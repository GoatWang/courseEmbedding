Unique Design.Proven Indication.




Unique Design


Intelligent engineering expands the physicians� reach to treat a wider range of anatomies with EVAR 
Revolutionary technology combines circular and helical structures that provide the flexibility needed to treat tortuous of anatomies

 halO Stent Technology is designed to allow the stent graft to conform to anatomy reducing the risk of kinking and endoleaks
 
Flexibility


Ring body and helical limb structure incorporating halO Stent Technology,� is designed to maintain patency in tortuous anatomies1

The circular design of the Aorfix Endovascular Stent Graft delivers unmatched flexibility while maintaining its luminal size � even in extreme angulations1

 halO Stent Technology allows Aorfix to have the flexibility to better match the anatomy in high neck angulations compared to traditional stent designs
 
Conformability


Designed to adapt to changing anatomy over time and accommodate pulsatile forces

Unique fish-mouth design facilitates a superior seal in changing neck morphologies 

Traditional stent graft designs versus halO Stent Technology which is engineered to conform to anatomical changes over time
 
Durability


Self-expanding electropolished nitinol wires mould to uneven vessel walls for improved apposition and seal

Rigorous testing performed that simulates in situ movement in angulated anatomy2 


Aorfix is tested to 400 million pulses at 90� angulation

5-7% pulsatility per 100mmHg - equivalent to 10 years

 
Aorfix Endovascular Stent Graft is designed to mould to tortuous arterial anatomies as well as maintain strong links between joining limb extensions 
 
 
Proven Indication
The Aorfix Endovascular Stent Graft is designed to extend the proven performance of current EVAR devices to include the successful treatment of complex anatomies with neck angulations of 0� to 90� as well as tortuous iliac arteries
A direct comparison of the PYTHAGORAS IDE data with various competitor IDE data shows the strength of the Aorfix clinical outcomes, results are unimpeded by the inclusion of patients with more challenging neck angulations significantly greater than 60�3&4

Comparison of Aorfix Results Versus Competitors

Proper graft fit and seal ensure procedural success and longevity in the treatment of neck angulations or tortuous iliacs. The results of the PYTHAGORAS trial demonstrate Aorfix' ability to achieve aims across a wider range of anatomies than competitive devices, due to Aorfix's unique flexible, conformable and durable design
 
5-Year Follow-Up

 
Aorfix is designed to effectively exclude the aneurysm over 5 years with lasting seal even in the changing neck morphology
 

 
Impressive sac diameter reduction over time with complete patency in the iliac arteries

Four Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

A mix of SEO tips, good marketing strategy, and tested usability features, here's the eight must-haves for your medical practice website.Download This ResearchAutomated On-Call Scheduling: Small Step, Big GainsTackling administrative challenges in healthcare enterprises often means big resource commitments that take years to pay off.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
