New Enterprise Stone and Lime buys Berks Products and EJB Paving 
13th February 201713th February 2017 


New Enterprise Stone & Lime Co has bought Berks Products Corporation and EJB Paving & Materials Co.
The acquisitions consist of two aggregate plants, two hot mix asphalt plants, four ready mixed concrete plants, and a construction supply center in Berks County, Pennsylvania.
The sites are between New Enterprise ’s existing Lehigh Valley and Lancaster locations, expanding its operating footprint and market scope into the Reading, Pennsylvania market.
New Enterprise says both businesses are highly-regarded in the community, with outstanding assets and attractive operating characteristics.
The total purchase price of the two acquisitions was approximately $46.3 million, net of a working capital adjustment, funded using existing cash and bank facilities, New Enterprise  sayhs.
New Enterprise “will leverage its new shared service center and the scalability of its infrastructure to seamlessly integrate the nine acquired facilities into the broader NESL operations.
“NESL expects to be selling, producing and accounting for all products almost immediately with minimal additional SG&A, outside of the costs associated with maintaining a portion of the salesforce of the acquired businesses,” the company saiod in a statement.
“On the heels of NESL’s strong third quarter 2017 earnings, the company is pleased to advise that it believes Fiscal Year ended February 28, 2018 will be the fifth consecutive year of expanding operating profit. The company expects that both acquisitions will provide significant synergies to NESL’s primary business next fiscal year and believes the incremental profit from the acquisitions will more than offset any lost profit from the recent divestiture of NESL’s PSI traffic and safety business,” it said.
Paul Detwiler, III, chief executive, New Enterprise Stone & Lime Co said: “Together with our $46.5 million of debt reduction in the previous two quarters, the Berks County acquisitions demonstrate the viability of our profit enhancement plan initiated five years ago. The acquisitions were completed with no additional long-term debt and will push our operating profit to record highs. We have now shown our ability to grow operating profit while reducing debt – a cornerstone of our operating plan going forward.”
