Item #: MPR-721-PA



			The MPR Series Hinged Glass Door Refrigerators from Panasonic are designed to meet regulatory guidelines and strict temperature requirements necessary for storing pharmaceuticals, medicines, vaccines, and other temperature-sensitive biologicals. In addition, they are ideal for various clinical research, pharmaceutical, and industrial laboratory applications including chromatography and pharmaceutical storage. The MPR-721-PA refrigerator features a unique, electronically monitored defrost cycle, which initiates only when needed to minimize temperature fluctuations. The flexible interior layout of this unit makes running experiments that require changeable shelf configurations effortless while the standard alarm and safety features monitor critical parameters and alert you of irregular temperature fluctuations within the cabinet. The MPR Series Refrigerators have all the right features for even the strictest application including: advanced temperature controls, precise uniformity, temperature stability, and accurate alarms and monitoring.

			 


		 

Product Features:


			ENERGY STAR Certified

			Wide Operating Range: With a temperature range of 2°C to 23°C, Panasonic’s MPR Series refrigerators are ideally suited for many reagents and biologicals that require a stable, cool temperature, or general cold storage environment.

			Microprocessor Controls: The microprocessor and the electronic temperature controls ensure that the set temperature is maintained, without being affected by the ambient temperature.

			Performance: For frequent door openings, Panasonic’s MPR Series refrigerators are equipped with powerful, hermetically sealed compressors that ensure superior pulldown characteristics, energy efficiency, and precise temperature control.

			Large Fans: The double 4.7”-diameter fans create a double flow system to ensure even temperatures throughout the cabinet. Because of this, heat spots from a powered test apparatus are minimized, while recovery characteristics after door openings remain outstanding.

			Shelves: The shelves can be arranged to accommodate tall apparatus such as fraction collectors. These shelves are deep and strong enough to hold most apparatus.
