About Us
Gustavo Dantas Jiu-Jitsu (GDJJ) Academy is the premier Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) School in Phoenix, Tempe, Scottsdale, Mesa, Chandler and Gilbert, Arizona. GDJJ Academy has been providing world-class instruction, building champions on and off the mat for 25 years. No matter your age, no matter your gender and no matter your size, Jiu-Jitsu is for you. Whether your goal is to be a World Champion competitor, learn self-defense, or increase your fitness, our Academy will be able to help you reach your goals.
 




















ADULT JIU-JITSU PROGRAM
This program provides some of the most comprehensive and effective instruction available in the United States. Known for its success in sport Jiu-Jitsu competition, the adult program has been developed and fine-tuned over the past 25 years. It continues to evolve to provide students with the technique that is relevant to today's standards and applicable for any life situation. This is a program with proven results and is focused on developing students not only physically, but mentally as well. With a wide variety of classes from beginners to competition training, our program fits all lifestyles and schedules.


















KIDS' JIU-JITSU PROGRAM
Jiu-Jitsu, which means “gentle art”, emphasizes the use of technique and leverage. Your child won’t have to rely on size, strength, or speed to defend themselves. We teach them to subdue their opponent in a safe and humane way, without having to rely on kicks and punches. Your child will develop physical awareness of balance, reflexes, flexibility and coordination, as well as build on the mental aspects of their personality such as self-esteem, discipline, confidence, compassion and good work ethic. The classes are taught in a positive, fun and friendly manner, so your child will enjoy learning the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.


















WOMEN'S JIU-JITSU PROGRAM
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the most valuable martial arts for women today. The key principles of leverage and technique provide women with the ability too not only defend themselves against an attacker, but also instill a sense of empowerment, confidence, and strength. Women will be able to learn in a safe and comfortable environment among other women without the intimidation that may come from training with male students. The women’s program focuses on the development of basic Jiu-Jitsu technique and is great for women of all ages, shapes, and sizes. With regular training, women will have the tools for self-defense, competition, fitness and self-improvement.

It has changed my life on multiple levels. Your first class will leave you with a “ YES I CAN” do attitude.Each workout is extremely intense and fun. How often do you hear someone say working out is exciting and fun? I’m in the best shape of my life thanks to Master Nottingham and his Coaches. Entire staff is very knowledgeable, helpful and encouraging. To date, I have lost 15 lbs, down 3 dress sizes and gained incredible amount of muscle no other workout has ever done for me. Added bonuses include endless nutritional tips and even special events. If you are ready to work hard, stay committed, and surround yourself with vibrant, energetic people then USA Martial Arts & Ilovekickboxingphx.com is for you. Try it, you won’t regret it!USA Martial ArtsSusan L. ratedI've been going to kickboxing classes here for three months, and it never stops being challenging.  There are always new moves to learn, but the best thing is getting instructed on how to improve our formation/stance/and how we do our moves.The coaches and students are very motivating and encouraging - not only in class, but by example. In addition to the classes, the coaches also encourage changing our eating habits to become healthier all around. Eating more food that don't come from bags that crinkle. This doesn't mean you need to give up chocolate chip cookies, just reduce the intake of them.I signed on for a year, it's worth the investment, and I'm looking forward to adding Krav Maga classes once I'm in better shape.USA Martial Artslpike25 ratedI haven't had much success in the past in sticking with exercise programs -I hate the gym and everyone in it, I used to run outside but developed horrible allergies, the elliptical in my living room makes a great clothes hanger, etc.I've been coming to USA Martial Arts kickboxing class for several years and it has made a huge impact on my life. The classes are varied and full of new things, the coaches are great, everyone encourages you to push yourself. If that part doesn't sound fun, you get to punch things. I just realized now why they call the class "I love kickboxing." Meta.Horizons Martial ArtsLea E. ratedKickboxing at Horizon is the best thing I do for myself physically and emotionally.  I taught aerobic classes at a fitness center for 11 years, after which I was totally burned out and didn't want to join a gym ever again. Kickboxing here is a physical challenge every time I go.  The class sizes are small, which feels almost like having a personal trainer every day.  Kettlebells and medicine balls are mixed into this intense workout.  Love this class and my results so much!USA Martial ArtsKelly M. ratedUSA Martial Arts has played a dynamic role in our family.  My husband and I are gaining strength and skills while our boys are gaining strength, skills, confidence and respect that is translating into every area of life.  Master John Nottingham is not only an accomplished Martial Artist, he is a gifted educator and a friendly, positive person to work with.  I would recommend USA Martial Arts to everyone looking to improve their health and life!  We LOVE it!!USA Martial ArtsSandra Á. ratedAfter 8 months of going to USA MArtial Arts for kickboxing classes I couldn't be happier. It was so hard for me to engage to something fitness related and now it has become an important part of my week. Staff is great! The workouts are very intense but the coaches make it so  much fun. Everyone is very friendly creating a very positive and healthy environment. Horizons Martial ArtsAmber F. ratedOutstanding schoolOur family has been apart of Horizons for 5 years and I could not be happy. The instructors are great with teaching kids and adults how to become martial artist and at the same time help them understand and develop respect for each other .  They also offer a fitness kickboxing class that is awesome. I would encourage anyone to become part of this family. Arizona Judo AcademyAaron J. ratedThis is a clean club with new equipment. I think the instructors are very diversified on instruction, with Kata, Judo technique, excellent ground work. Great combination of combination Judo with wrestling.Arizona Judo AcademyDan M. ratedThe club is clean with a bunch of blackbelt instructors.  I think it is a great competition club for kids and adults. Very similar to Greco Roman wrestlingUSA Oyama Karatefalconsfan42 ratedFeel my fighting ability and conditioning increasing very satisfactorily.
