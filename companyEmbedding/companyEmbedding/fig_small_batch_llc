			Tom Knibbs of Urban Accents Inc.
		




Small-batch foodmakers vie for space on grocers' shelves


Nearly 20 years ago, Tom Knibbs mixed his first spice blends in a big green Tupperware bowl to give to friends and family as Christmas gifts. Now he runs Urban Accents Inc., a Chicago-based purveyor of 150 spice blends, seasoned salts and specialty mixes that are stocked in hundreds of stores across the country including Crate & Barrel, Sur La Table and Mariano's. He's one of dozens of local entrepreneurs clamoring for a footing in the competitive specialty foods market—crafting the artisanal cookies, coffees, chocolates and other premium goods that often combine the sector's holy trinity of local, seasonal and natural. The niche is heating up, fueled by a growing appetite for locally produced items and consumers' willingness to shell out a little bit more for high-quality and natural eats.    U.S. sales of specialty foods and beverages, including imports, rose 14.3 percent to $86 billion in 2012, more than double the 6.8 percent increase in the prior year, according to research released in August by Mintel Group Ltd., a London-based market research firm. This accounts for slightly more than 13 percent of all food sales. Nearly 75 percent of consumers said they made a specialty food purchase last year, up 29 percent from 2009, according to Mintel. Figures for the Midwest were slightly lower  than the national average. Despite the growth in purchasing, bringing a specialty product to market is a tough sell. Many small-batch producers use premium, natural ingredients, which often cost more and don't contain the preservatives that extend shelf life. Small producers lack the purchasing power of their conventional counterparts, say food industry watchers, and slotting and marketing fees charged by national retailers can be cost-prohibitive. Competition is fierce, with 15,000 food and beverage companies entering the market each year, according to industry estimates.  And while many players in the small-batch arena boast impressive culinary skills, they often lack the experience needed to scale a business.  Still, Urban Accents' Mr. Knibbs says he regularly encourages would-be foodmakers to jump in. “If you can make a good product, you can figure it out,” he says. “You have to have passion.” Working out of a 30,000-square-foot Ravenswood office and warehouse, the company Mr. Knibbs, 55, co-founded in 1996 stays true to its small-batch roots, blending spices to order and hand-packing and labeling each product. By Mr. Knibbs' estimates, the company produces 500 bottles at a time, about 65 pounds of herbs and seasonings, compared with major manufacturers, which may have the equipment and capacity to produce—and warehouse—50,000 pounds of their products at a time.  Urban Accents has little inventory; it takes the company two to four weeks to fulfill orders. “That's our proposition to the marketplace,” says Mr. Knibbs. “It makes us unique, and we can keep our quality and innovation that way.” Here's what's cooking with three other up-and-coming food entrepreneurs: 







Stu's Heritage Foods LLCWebsite: StusKitchen.comLocation: ChicagoFounder: Stu Waters, 30On The Menu: "This is Bloody Mary" concentrated mix ($10-$12); "This is Bloody Mary" five-piece boxed Mixology Kit ($45); Stu's Sour spicy garlic pickles ($11-$15). Stu's Sour pickle juice will launch in January and is billed as a post-workout electrolyte replacement for athletes.Backstory: Mr. Waters learned the art and science of fermentation and canning at culinary school and worked as a bartender and restaurant server for 14 years. He launched his "pickle project" in 2010 with $5,000 and a crop of cucumbers sourced from a Michigan farm. The following year, he created his Bloody Mary concentrate, a spicy spin on the classic vodka cocktail using leftover brine from the pickle-making process. Packaging sports a "clean, urban design that looks as good as our products taste," says Mr. Waters. Pickle jars are sealed with photos of a rotating lineup of customers' "sour" faces. "I think personality matters when it comes to packaging."Growth: T.J. Maxx and Anthropologie stores will stock Mixology Kits nationally later this month for the holiday season—the company's first crossover into big-box retailing. Its Bloody Mary products are sold at 150 specialty retailers nationwide and are used at local restaurants including Sepia, Boka and GT Fish & Oyster; sales through the company's website are "robust." Stu's Sour pickles are local only and can be found at Binny's Beverage Depot, Pastoral Artisan Cheese, Bread & Wine and Plum Market. Mr. Waters did not disclose revenue but says the company "smashed" its $100,000 year-end revenue projection by more than 200 percent.Challenge: Last year, Mr. Waters contracted with a manufacturer near Grand Rapids, Mich., to ramp up production. "This was a game-changer for us," he says. "As we step into the adolescence of the company, we want to be small and hands-on but also scalable. It sounds easier than it is."Lesson Learned: Omaha, Neb.-based investor Jeff Zindel became a 30 percent owner last year. Maureen O'Brien, who owns a marketing agency in Omaha, became a 5 percent owner in June. "I recognize my skills and deficits, and I try to fill in the gaps," Mr. Waters says. "Don't assume you can do everything. You just can't."







Rare Bird PreservesWebsite: RareBirdPreserves.comLocation: Oak ParkFounder: Elizabeth Madden, 43On The Menu: Seven flavors of jam, including top-selling cherry lime and Meyer lemon curd ($8-$10). Seasonal flavors, currently fig Earl Grey and apple caramel, change quarterly. Limited- edition Black Label jams ($16-$20) are sold at the Logan Square Farmers Market. The recent Black Label offering, fig raspberry, sold out in less than a month.Backstory: Ms. Madden fell in love with preserving fruit while studying at the French Pastry School in Chicago. She makes jams in the French tradition using an 11-gallon copper pot, seasonal fruits and herbs and natural ingredients. "When I made my products, they seemed so different from anything I saw on the market," she says. The Rare Bird name comes from the nickname her grandmother gave her as a child.Growth: Launched in 2006 with $20,000 from personal savings and loans from family members, Ms. Madden and four employees work out of an 1,800-square-foot storefront she purchased five years ago; she also rents workspace to five other chefs. Jams are stocked in 60 stores in 15 states, including some Whole Foods Market, Dean & Deluca and Plum Market locations. Products also appear on local restaurant menus including Xoco, City Winery and Glazed & Infused. Ms. Madden did not disclose revenue but says sales are up 77 percent from last year.Challenge: Ms. Madden recently signed on with a distributor that has doubled the number of stores that carry her products. She says the company has reached a tipping point: "I have the opportunity to take on a huge national account, and that makes me pause. How do you go from a hand-labeled product to a national brand? It's a worthy brand and people are excited about it. At some point I have to restructure the way I'm running my business. The model is becoming outdated." She says companies like Columbus, Ohio-based Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams and Waukegan-based Nielsen-Massey Vanillas Inc. offer a blueprint for managing growth and maintaining quality.Lesson Learned: "Assume people are going to love your product and be ready," she says. "If you can make 25 jars, how can you make 25,000 jars? I was startled by the interest in my jams and I made mistakes early on because I didn't plan for growth. I didn't take into consideration that people would care as much as they have."







Twofold LLCWebsite: TwofoldFoods.comLocation: ChicagoFounders: Jennifer Blaeser, 46, and Paula Morawski, 44 (at right)On The Menu: Three granola blends: classic, pistachio and quinoa ($8.50-$9); two nut blends: Savory Nuts and Glazed Almonds ($9.50-$10).Backstory: Former road warriors at management consulting firm Booz & Co., Ms. Blaeser and Ms. Morawski found few healthy food choices when parked at airports and hotels and during long work sessions. They began travelling with their own nuts, energy bars and homemade granola, which Ms. Blaeser would bake and share at team meetings. Now top-selling locations include the Westin Hotel in River North, the Hyatt Hotel at McCormick Place and the East Bank Club in Chicago, where customers are looking for health and convenience. "It feels like we've come full circle," Ms. Morawski says.Growth: The company launched in January with $15,000 from each partner. In September, the granolas were picked up by Whole Foods Market's Gold Coast store; products also are carried by 30 independent retailers and hotels in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Texas. The company has turned a slight profit and is on track to exceed first-year revenue projections, the owners say.Challenge: The partners are beginning to outgrow the incubator kitchen they use for production and are evaluating how to manage operations. They'd like to hire two bakers and eventually sign on with a local distributor, and they're exploring grab-and-go-sized packaging to accommodate food-service providers like hotels and corporate cafeterias. "We've established proof of concept—now we want to get better organized so we can scale going forward," Ms. Morawski says.Lesson Learned: Twofold granolas are full of whole nuts and made from natural ingredients like pure maple syrup, which drive up price but differentiate the products, Ms. Morawski says. "Know what your anchor is," she says. "It will be challenged. We want to make a product that is healthy and nutritious and filling. We didn't want to make a product that could sit on the shelf for three years. You did this for a reason. The market will tell you if there is a gap or not."More from this week's Focus section:Shared kitchens cultivate startupsThe new food chain: Two angel funds invest in local food sceneGet your foodie delight into Whole Foods in 4 (not-so-easy) steps

About Us

Fig & Flour Bakery ( a Sweet Art by Olivia LLC co) is a small batch wholesale bakery. We sell direct to consumer, as well as to businesses and restaurants. Our Bakery was born of a passion for quality and artistry. The story begins with community sharing. When quality and love is baked into each product it shows, our desserts were requested time and time again, new challenges were presented, and word of mouth spread quickly. Soon our love of confections had us agreeing to all types of special requests. A few classes, and the local creative community, taught that a passion can grow into a career. We are active in the community, and love the opportunity to serve and donate to various causes. Please take a moment to view our gallery. We hope to have the opportunity to meet you and make your event one to be spoken about for time to come.
