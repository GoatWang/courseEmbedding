“We are excited to have Gary and the rest of the NOGA team, as well as their coaches, players, teams, clubs and families join the UK Elite family,” Smoothey continued. “We have personally known the principals at NOGA for 20 years and are confident that our shared core values and principles makes NOGA a perfect fit for UK Elite. Together we are in a unique position to further establish ourselves as the industry gold standard in coaching excellence.”
