  Account Based Marketing | Triblio            (888) 328-8667 [email protected]Login     Select Page   Account Based MarketingA Account Based MarketingWhat is account based marketing?Target accounts each with a unique multichannel campaign.Account based marketing (ABM) is a framework for targeting specific accounts or account segments, usually by purchase history, firmographics, product need, or strategic value.ABM uses demand generation techniques with the objective to increase new accounts or revenue per existing account instead of simply focusing on lead generation. Increasing quality leads in target accounts is just the first step for ABM. Account based tactics is a multi-step process which influences stakeholders that are part of a buying group throughout the entire buyer journey.The buyer journey includes, for new logos, the stages from discovery to proposal to win. You can even use account based marketing for your existing customers from upsell, cross-sell, retention and advocacy. Additionally, account based marketing is for both your inbound and outbound marketing campaigns.ABM is no longer a cute buzzword or trend. With the proven success and impact of ABM programs, research advisory firms such as SiriusDecisions and TOPO have debuted new demand funnels constructed with the core principles and strength of ABM. “With ABM, we can engage more stakeholders during the sales process.”Brendon O'DonovanVP of Marketing, AquicoreWho needs account based marketing?ABM is not just for your marketing team. ABM is not solely for your sales team either. ABM is a strategy that your entire organization needs to adopt. From your sales reps and marketing managers all the way to your client success teams, adopting and adapting to a complete account based approach centralizes your entire organization. Forrester released a report on how ABM aligns sales and marketing.More and more organizations are moving to an account-based approach after seeing the success of other organizations. TOPO reports that over 80% of organizations that have launched ABM campaigns for a year or more have met or exceeded expectations.When practicing ABM, it is essential for sales and marketing to work together. Stakeholders across the account will receive integrated campaigns and a unified contact strategy with consistent messaging and CTAs across sales and marketing touchpoints. Instead of measuring channel performance by leads, account based marketing groups contacts and leads into account-based metrics that are tracked throughout the entire buyer journey.Account based marketing is for: Marketers that want their marketing campaigns to deliver results and revenue, not empty promisesAccount executives that only want to talk to their target accounts and waste no time with those outside of targetSales representatives that only want to deliver in-target contacts and demosOrganizations that want to reduce waste, maximize revenue, and take advantage of the latest innovations of marketing technologySee how Triblio can help you achieve your ABM goals.Triblio account based marketing software enables marketers to create ABM campaigns to:Customize messaging, content, and CTAs by account segments: prospect vs. customer, product interest, content topic interest, firmagraphics, or funnel stageUnify marketing and sales messaging across corporate channels for specific account targetsConnect sales and email cross-sell/upsell campaigns across multiple channelsIncrease engagement of unknown contacts and visitors within target accountsDetermine purchase intent and content interest known and unknown visitor behavior by accountWant more account based marketing?Here are some of our favorite resources to get you started: Getting Started with ABM: Using Account-Based TacticsGetting Started with ABM: ABM Program “Carve-Out”Getting Started with ABM: Account Based Demand Generation See how account based marketing will fit your business Get ABM Consultation

Triblio Raises $3.4M For A Data-Driven Approach To Content Marketing

Triblio, a startup that says it’s bringing “science to the art of content marketing,” is announcing that it has raised $3.4 million in seed funding.
Content marketing startups (i.e. the ones that help companies produce blog posts, videos, and other content that can indirectly promote their brand) have announced some big rounds this year — NewsCred raised $25 million, Percolate raised $24 million, and Contently raised $9 million. And if recent product launches are any indication, there’s an appetite for more data around this content, too.
Triblio’s CEO Andre Yee was previously vice president of product development at Oracle-acquired Eloqua, and he told me that Triblio is different in a couple of ways. For one thing, he noted that many of these content marketing companies are trying to sell their tools to outfits that market to consumers, while Triblio is more focused on businesses that sell their products to other businesses. Second, he said that unlike the competition, he’s less focused on “the process of production” and more on “the science of content.”
“What is my buyer interested in right now?” Yee added. “What conclusions can I draw about their propensity to engage with me? What’s the next piece of content that needs to be served up to them in order to engage them? We provide the intelligence to make that happen.”
He said that there are three main pieces to the Triblio platform. First, it looks at users visiting your website or engaging with your company on social media and assigns them a certain persona. For example, a company trying to reach customer service managers can create a that persona in Triblio and identify the common characteristics of customer service managers — then Triblio will determine what stories are popular among those kinds of people and recommend content that’s likely to be relevant to them.
Second, there’s “a content development kit” with things like a content calendar and workflow management (so Triblio isn’t ignoring the production process entirely). Third, Triblio tracks the effectiveness of content on your website and on social media. The company just left private beta, and it says its customers include Deltek, Parature, Vocus, and Neustar.
As for the funding, it was led by Longworth Venture Partners and Kepha Partners. Kepha’s Eric Hjerpe and Longworth’s Jim Savage are joining Triblio’s board of directors.

  Digium Case Study · Triblio            (888) 328-8667 [email protected]Login     Select Page   Digium increased total web conversions by 32% Digium, the largest open-sourced telecom equipment provider, wanted to improve the quantity and quality of leads. With Triblio, they used account based messaging and CTAs by funnel stage, industry, and geography.About the CompanyDigium®, Inc., created the innovative force behind Asterisk, the most widely used open source telephony software with customers like Google and the US Army. Digium has become the open source alternative to proprietary communication providers, with offerings that cut costs by as much as 80%. Digium’s ABM ProblemDigium’s main source of leads is their web channels. Centered around a vibrant open source community, their web properties generate hundreds of thousands of visitors per year with different needs and objectives. Depending on persona and account profile, Digium needed to serve specific and relevant content, messaging, and promotional product offers. In the sales process, Digium wanted customers to get upsell promotions to purchase more equipment. Prospects from noncommercial organizations should receive messaging about the cost benefits of open source, while commercial organizations needed messaging to address reliability concerns.Triblio’s ABM SolutionTriblio’s ABM web campaigns could dynamically serve the right message and offer to known and unknown visitors.Target anonymous visitors by account firmagraphics Digium set out to increase leads from unknown visitors in their target industries of professional services, government, healthcare, auto, and education services. Triblio can recognize a visitor’s industry profile using reverse IP lookup, marketing automation segments, and user behavior. Once visitors are profiled by account, Triblio offers relevant content such as eBooks, webinars, and whitepapers. Through this level of personalization, Digium is able to nurture visitors at an early stage and increase email capture – which corresponds to a shorter sales cycle. The campaign was set for exit-intent deployment to capture bouncing visitors and turn them into leads.  Web nurturing by geo locationTriblio can determine location by country, MSA, and DMA codes. For non-US visitors, Digium’s home page banner is focused on brand positioning messaging about open source telephony’s reliability since they are not targeted prospects. US visitors to the home page receive brand messaging focusing on cost with an ROI calculator call to action. Digium utilizes web nurturing by displaying different imaging, messaging, and CTAs to specific locations to keep the product information relevant and engaging in order to gather more conversions.Upsell offers for customersTriblio can identify Digium’s existing customers. Since they are already familiar with open source telephony and Digium already has their email, the customer CTAs are product offers. Product offers depend on the purchase history and firmagraphics of the visitor. Some companies receive a Switchvox cloud offer while others receive an offer for free phones. This increases the effectiveness of the discount promo, as well as the promotion’s efficiency since discounts are not needlessly given away.  Slideout and popup methods matterTriblio’s technology gives marketers control to choose the best slideout or popup method to achieve results. For example, blog traffic visitors should see CTAs before exiting the page because blog pages are an entry AND exit page. If visitors are at your product page, however, they are engaged. The best tactic would be to slide out a relevant CTA after the visitor has been on the page for more than a few seconds.Talk through best uses cases for your business needs Get an ABM Consultation           Triblio Software | G2 Crowd
