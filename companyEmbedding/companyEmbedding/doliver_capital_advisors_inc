Strategy | Doliver Advisors
























































 
 





Strategy




Quantitative Investing
Doliver implements a quantitative investing strategy which uses statistical models, programming, active trading and short holding periods.  Our trading process uses real time and historical data model inputs to project discount changes and then screens these by importance of our weighting parameters.  A few of Doliver’s model components are annual return, annual risk, capital capacity, turnover and sharpe ratio.  These components are used to determine the attractiveness of a fund for our client’s portfolios.  We then rank the funds and execute trades through a proprietary trading platform.

 
 









 







About CEFs | Doliver Advisors
























































 
 





Closed-End Funds




Our Niche In The Market

Doliver has been managing money for clients since 1988, over 28 years. It focuses exclusively on investing in closed-end funds (CEFs). A closed-end fund is a professionally managed portfolio of individual securities which has a specific value, called the “net asset value” (NAV). The NAV is derived from the sum of the total value of securities held in the portfolio, divided by the total number of outstanding shares. A fund’s NAV is a specific price per share and is calculated daily based on the closing market price.
 
Different from a mutual fund, a closed-end fund shares are not redeemable from the fund itself, based on the daily NAV. Instead, the shares of a closed-end fund trade on the major exchanges where the forces of supply and demand cause share prices to fluctuate. Since shares are bought and sold in the open market, at any given time, the share price of a closed-end fund may be greater (premium position) or less (discount position) than the NAV, thus creating potential pricing inefficiencies. As a simplified illustration, a closed-end fund investor may buy $1 worth of stock ($1 NAV) for 90 cents. Or, one may sell $1 worth of stock ($1 NAV) for $1.10. Of course, the converse may also be true. Although more than 550 different closed-funds exist today, with over $215 billion dollars in total capitalization, they represent a relatively small part of the overall market.

Long-Term Growth
CAPITALIZING ON CEF PRICING INEFFICIENCIES

Core Strategies 
Doliver’s long-term, wealth-building strategy is derived from our strategic investing approach and quantitative models.

Since inception, Doliver has capitalized on pricing inefficiencies identified in the CEF niche.
Learn About CEFs



Our Founder's Background
After graduating from Rice University, Ron Olin joined IBM directing programmer staffs for ground-based computer systems for the Apollo space program at NASA. After 17 years, Ron applied his extensive knowledge of computer-based analytics to investment markets, where he derived the core belief that the financial markets are overall very efficient. He then began work to develop a program and became an activist in closed-end funds (CEF’s).

The investment principles employed by Doliver Capital Advisors were then established. Our strategy utilizes a proprietary quantitative model and database to identify and evaluate probabilities related to price and NAV changes in order to select a portfolio of attractively valued closed-end funds. Doliver has focused its effort and research in this specific market niche since inception in 1988.

Priorities




Our Beliefs
 

We believe safety and preservation of capital are a priority.
 
We believe the compensation to Doliver should be directly related to performance and based on the success of the client’s account.
 
We believe that the stock market in general is very efficient and that no one can consistently predict or time the market.
We believe that with proper analysis and sufficient effort, inefficiencies, or inappropriately priced closed-end funds, can be identified and exploited.
 
We believe discipline in buying at the right price leads to better returns.
