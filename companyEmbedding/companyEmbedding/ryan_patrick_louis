Patrick, Ryan Nicholas age 13, fortified with the Sacraments of Holy Mother Church on Saturday, November 13, 2010. Beloved son of Amelia and Wade Patrick; precious grandson of John and Nancy Patrick, Carol Holtz and the late Donald Holtz; beloved brother of Andrew, Carol and Evan; dear Godson of David and Dee Dee Holtz; cherished nephew of Mike Henson and a multitude of aunts and uncles; cousin to many and an inspiration to thousands. Ryan described himself as smart, reserved, resilient, creative, determined, thoughtful, funny with a dry sense of humor and logical. But above all, Ryan described himself as loved. Ryan was our precious son. He was our wise, witty and stubborn brother. A devoted friend and courageous warrior in his daily battle for life. Ryan was his dad's buddy and best friend spending many hours together sharing their passion for trains, cars, coins and adventure novels. Ryan delighted in snowball fights, sand boxes, dogs, babies, collecting Hot Wheels, bottle caps, stamps, coins and model trains. He also delighted in sparring with his brothers and sister. The biggest joys of Ryan's life were playing baseball, vacations to Florida and Arizona, riding diesel and steam trains and going with his dad to train clubs and conventions. Ryan delighted in the shower of hundreds of birthday cards from around the world each year. He cultivated a great love for cooking, gourmet foods, gardening and independent learning. Ryan was a truth speaker and required honesty of those around him, especially his parents and medical team. He refused to be intimidated by life even as life threw so many challenges at him. But by the end he was weary and battle scarred like an old Sherman tank. He has now gone onto a richly deserved rest. We love him, miss him and look forward to the day when we will once again be reunited. Do not coax me off The Edge. It is where I exist. Its sharpness defines my joy, my pain. The Edge means I endure, persist. And where exactly would you coax me? Your Edge is not the same. I see you there and I applaud you, but on My Edge choose to remain. When from my Edge I fall completely, do not fear I left undone. I drunk it all, I lived completely. I will not leave What I should have done. Services: On Thursday, Nov. 18 there will be an open casket viewing at Ambruster-Donnelly Mortuary from 4-8 PM for Ryan's devoted family and friends, along with his beloved medical Team/family. On Friday, Nov. 19 there will be a closed casket visitation for the vast community of those touched by Ryan's life, held in the Great Hall at Ambruster Donnelly Mortuary from 3-8 PM. The funeral will be held at Mary Queen of Peace Church in Webster Grove on Saturday, Nov. 20 at 10 AM. In honor of Ryan, please dress colorfully--Ryan found joy in and appreciated the vibrance of the color wheel. www.caringbridge.org/ visit/ryanpatrick

Sometimes wine's just about fun, and "fun" is what this great value red blend is all about.  Cabernet, Syrah, Merlot and Petit Verdot get picked ripe and fermented gently to extract lots of fruit and no hard edges.  Bold black cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors plus accents of dark chocolate, dried herb and red currant.  This is plush, velvety and smooth with lots of fruit on the drink-me-anytime finish.  Fun!

This is the kind of bold, rich, and super-plush red blend that Washington does so well.  It's a blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 4% Primitivo, picked ripe and given a dark, chocolatey and spicy sheen by a year in 20% new American oak.  Creamy and smooth in texture with bold blackberry and black raspberry fruit with accents of lavender, cocoa and vanilla and a long, smooth, finish.
