Nov. 17: Meet Heidi Wagner, Hearst Professional-in-Residence 



Published:  Nov. 7, 2014 


 

Lecture: "Putting Your Journalism Degree to Work" 
Date: Monday, Nov. 17
Time: 11:30 a.m.
Location: IBS 155A
Heidi L. Wagner, vice president of global government affairs for Alexion Pharmaceuticals, is an attorney with more than 20 years of experience in health care legislative and regulatory policy issues. Prior to joining Alexion in 2009, Ms. Wagner was Sr. Director of Government Affairs for Genentech, and also consulted for a variety of health plans, biopharmaceutical and other health care-related companies.
Ms. Wagner's policy expertise broadly encompasses issues relating to biotechnology/pharmaceuticals and public payer policy. She has led numerous federal legislative/regulatory strategic efforts relating to, among other issues, Medicare payment policy, follow-on biologics/biosimilars and HIPAA/health privacy; and advises regularly on the commercial implications of such federal policy and political initiatives.
Ms. Wagner received a Bachelor of Science degree in Journalism and Mass Communication from the University of Colorado Boulder, and earned a law degree from the George Mason University School of Law in Virginia.
Not all journalism degrees lead to careers in the industry, but Wagner says the skills she obtained while studying journalism at CU proved essential to her success in the booming field of health care policy. Join us for a free lunch and learn how she puts her journalism skills to work in unexpected ways.
The Hearst Professional-in-Residence program provides fellowships for professionals to visit CU-Boulder each semester and provide helpful lessons and advice to students and faculty. Its purpose is to introduce nationally known, accomplished professionals to our students to enrich their studies. The program is funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
