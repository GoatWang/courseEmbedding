How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.              
              
            

12:40 p.m. July 28, 2017






What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?              
              
            

5:47 p.m. July 27, 2017






Put your money where your mindset is
              
              Socially conscious mutual funds invest in ways that can be good for society and your portfolio.

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio (GLDV0173)
	
	




Strategy
		  	
		  	
		
		The Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio is an enhanced index* unit investment trust that invests in stocks of foreign and domestic companies. The strategy contains three approximately equally weighted dividend oriented strategies: the Select 10 Industrial Strategy, the Select S&P Industrial Strategy, and the EAFESM Select 20 Strategy. 

Why consider investing in the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio?
The Portfolio invests in stocks of foreign and domestic companies selected by applying separate uniquely specialized strategies. The Portfolio combines three investment strategies: the Select 10 Industrial Strategy, the Select S&P Industrial Strategy, and the EAFESM Select 20 Strategy.




Here are some reasons why the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio may be a viable addition to your portfolio: 

Foreign Exposure 
Multi-Index Exposure 
Potential Decreased Volatility
Potential Dividends 

Stock Selection Process
The Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio invests in stocks of foreign and domestic companies. The strategy contains three approximately equally weighted dividend oriented strategies:

The Select 10 Industrial Strategy selects the ten highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM (DJIASM) for the portfolio.
The Select S&P Industrial Strategy

Beginning with the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index, select only those stocks ranked either A or A+ by S&P Capital IQ's Earnings and Dividend Rankings.
Eliminate stocks that are in both the S&P Industrial Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Select stocks with the highest market capitalization (the top 75 percent).
Select the 15 highest dividend-yielding stocks.


In addition, a stock will be excluded if, based on publicly available information as of the selection date, the company is the target of an announced business acquisition which Invesco expects will close within six months of the date of deposit.
The EAFESM Select 20 Strategy



Start with the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) Index. 
Assess company quality. This consists of applying sales growth, earnings growth and dividend performance screens. 
Stocks with the highest market capitalizationthe top 75 percentare chosen.
Select a portfolio of the twenty highest dividend-yielding stocks.Please note that stocks traded in Singapore are eliminated from the portfolio strategy to help limit exposure to uncertain political and economic conditions. Stocks which are passive foreign investment companies are also eliminated because of the negative tax treatment which could result from such ownership.



* An enhanced sector (or “index”) strategy refers to a unit
investment trust strategy, sponsored by Invesco Capital
Markets, Inc., that seeks to outperform an index by
investing in an objectively selected subset of stocks from
the same index.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk




There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment
in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of
securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what
you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life
except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be
considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by
investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from
one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or
assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current
levels or increase over time.

assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current
levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in
the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold.
There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits
and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the
United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic
uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
The Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM (DJIASM) is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S.
stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S.
stock market. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, and Far East Index ("MSCI EAFESM")
is an unmanaged index generally representative of major overseas stock markets. MSCI EAFESM data is U.S.
dollar adjusted. The S&P Industrials Index is a capitalization — weighted index of all stocks in the S&P 500 Index
that are involved in the industrials industry.
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an
investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the index is shown for illustrative purposes
only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or
the trust, which will vary. Securities in which the trust invests may differ from those in the index.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.

 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk




There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment
in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of
securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what
you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life
except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be
considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by
investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from
one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or
assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current
levels or increase over time.

The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in
the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold.
There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits
and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the
United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic
uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an
investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the index is shown for illustrative purposes
only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or
the trust, which will vary. Securities in which the trust invests may differ from those in the index.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer
the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend
investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily
out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment
combines the two styles.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the
United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic
uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

combines the two styles.

 The above graph represents a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the trust strategy (not any actual trust) and the associated benchmark over the period indicated in the graph. The graph assumes the sum of the initial investment ($10,000) and all dividends (including those on stocks trading ex-dividend as of the last day of the year) and appreciation during a year are reinvested at the end of that year. 
All strategy performance is hypothetical (not any actual trust) and reflects trust sales charges (full sales charge in first year of 2.95% and reduced rollover charge thereafter of 1.95%) and expenses but not brokerage commissions on stocks or taxes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Actual returns will vary from hypothetical strategy returns due to timing differences and because the trust may not be invested equally in all stocks or be fully invested at all times. In any given year the strategy may lose money or underperform the index. Returns are calculated by taking year-end prices, subtracting them from the prices at the end of the following year (adjusting for any stock splits that might have occurred during the year) and adding dividends received for the period divided by starting price. Average annual total return and total return measure change in the value of an investment plus dividends, assuming quarterly reinvestment of dividends. Average annual total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects aggregate change and is not annualized. Standard deviation is a measure of volatility that represents the degree to which an investment's performance has varied from its average performance over a particular period. Standard deviation does not compare the volatility of an investment relative to other investments or the overall stock market. The more an investment's return varies from the investment's average return, the more volatile the investment. Standard deviation is based on past performance and is no guarantee of future results.
 Please keep in mind that high, double-digit and/or triple-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the indices are shown for illustrative purposes only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or the trust, which will vary.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

In the new sales  charge structure, the deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per $10 unit and comprise the maximum sales charge on the initial date of deposit. With this in mind, the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee will vary as a percentage with changes in the public offering price and when the public offering price is greater than $10, the sales charge will include an upfront component. Sales charges will not exceed the total sales charges shown above. Investors in fee accounts will only be charged the C&D Fee.2 As of Mar. 31, 2017 through Invesco Unit Investment Trusts and predecessor firms.




About risk
There is no assurance that a series of the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in any series of this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by a trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust’s life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as a part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and more complete information about the trust, investors should ask their advisor(s) for a prospectus or download one at invesco.com/uit.
Invesco unit investment trusts are distributed by the Sponsor, Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. and broker dealers including Invesco Distributors, Inc. Both firms are wholly owned, indirect subsidiaries of Invesco Ltd.

Infrastructure investing: From concrete to computer chips
Learn why Invesco Unit Trusts views information technology as a critical part of the infrastructure category.
By Nick Clare, Associate Portfolio Manager, Invesco Unit Trusts


Make American infrastructure great again!
As we begin a New Year, with a new President, investors may be reevaluating certain portfolio positions in an effort to capitalize on changes to come. Although presidential races can be laced with exaggeration and sometimes even unrealistic promises, investors can often still find investment opportunity in the core ideas and concepts of a future leader. In the case of President Donald Trump, there were often four consistent core concepts he campaigned around: Fiscal easing, deregulation, trade and infrastructure spending. With a purported spending plan in excess of $1 trillion dollars, it is infrastructure that we want to focus on today. Industrials and Materials are commonly considered categories tied to infrastructure but are these two the only market segments to benefit from potential increased spending?
Invesco Unit Trusts believes in expanding the definition of infrastructure beyond the three traditional categories: transportation, telecommunication and energy to include information technology. Technology, such as software, cyber security technology and cloud based applications have become as important to the operation of a global economy as the actual structures they reside in. For example, which is more important to the cell tower, the steel frame or the communication chips inside of it? When looking at infrastructure capital expenditures the answer to this question has become increasingly clear as IT spending has garnered a larger portion of allocated funding. In recent past, infrastructure budgets have been limited, which has led to a reliance on technology to extend the lifespan of existing investments, improve efficiency and boost return on investment of existing infrastructure. Although the present opportunity resides in traditional infrastructure investments, Invesco Unit Trusts believes a modern approach to this theme may complement traditional categories while, supplying additional diversification to the theme.

Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and more complete information about the trust, investors should ask their advisor(s) for a prospectus or download one at invesco.com/uit.

The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Security prices will fluctuate. The value of an investment may fall over time.
A security issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends or make other distributions in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may reduce the level of distributions certain of the Portfolio's securities pay which would reduce your income and may cause the value of the Units to fall.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio invests in MLPs. Most MLPs operate in the energy sector and are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in that sector, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject the risk that regulatory or legislative changes could eliminate the tax benefits enjoyed by MLPs which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs and/or the value of the Portfolio's investments.
The trust is concentrated in the information technology sector. There are certain risks specific to the information technology sector such as rapid product obsolescence, volatile stock prices and speculative trading.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.
Trust objective: The portfolio seeks to provide above-average total return.The portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks and other equity securities of companies in industries that may benefit from increased levels of infrastructure investment in the United States. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., the Sponsor, seeks to identify companies that are involved in America's movement towards energy independence, technology and communication growth, renewable energy and utility service modernization. The Sponsor believes that certain industries may have the potential to benefit from increased spending on infrastructure repair and growth in America, including the construction, engineering, utilities, renewable energy, energy pipeline and transportation, railroad, technology and telecommunication infrastructure industries.

Compared with the top income tax rate of 43.4%, QDI is taxed at just 23.8% for those in the top tax bracket and 18.8% for investors in most lower brackets.


The preferred opportunity
On top of the potentially attractive yields for preferred securities, they may also allow investors to keep more of what they earn. Preferreds generally pay qualified dividend income (QDI)1, which is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Compared with the top income tax rate of 43.4%, QDI is taxed at just 23.8% for those in the top tax bracket and 18.8% for investors in most lower brackets. 
Preferred securities are a potential high income alternative to investment grade and high yield bonds.2 Tax-advantaged income helps you potentially keep more of what you earn. In a rising interest rate environment, you may want to focus on income and spreads. Within credit sensitive fixed income securities, preferred securities are offering an attractive yield when comparing the yield spreads between investment-grade preferred securities and high-yield bonds.
For investors interested in a potentially high income and tax-advantaged investment, Invesco Unit Trust's Preferred Opportunity Portfolio (PFOP) is a duration sensitive approach with a portfolio that seeks to take advantage of the current spread advantage and fixed-to-float nature offered by preferreds.
Many preferred securities offer tax-advantaged income, potentially resulting in higher after-tax yields than municipal bonds3

An investor cannot invest directly in an index and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes. Notes: Yields shown on a yield-to-maturity basis. The risks of loss attributable to bonds is generally less than that associated with owning preferred securities. (a) For individuals with income less than $400K, qualified dividend income is taxed at 18.8% and the marginal tax rate used was 38.8%. Both rates include the Medicare surcharge of 3.8%. (b) For individuals with income exceeding $400K, qualified dividend income is taxed at 23.8% and the marginal tax rate used was 43.4%. Both rates include the Medicare surcharge of 3.8%. (c) BofA Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index (Credit quality: BBB) tracks the performance of fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated preferred securities issued in the U.S. domestic market. (d) BofA Merrill Lynch Municipal Master Index (Credit quality: AA-) tracks the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade tax-exempt debt publicly issued by U.S. states and territories, and their political subdivisions, in the U.S. domestic market. Note: State and local taxes are not included in these calculations. You should consult your tax professional concerning federal, state and local tax consequences of investing in a particular series.

1 The Sponsor seeks to allocate a significant portion of the portfolio in preferred securities whose distributions are taxed as qualified dividend income (QDI). Approximately 80% or more of the portfolio of each PFOP trust deposited since May 2014 has been invested in preferred securities whose distributions are taxed as QDI. 
2 Between 20–30% of the portfolio of each PFOP trust deposited since May 2014 has been invested in preferred securities rated below investment grade, otherwise known as "junk" securities. Please refer to a PFOP prospectus for a full discussion regarding the risks related to investments in "junk" rated securities. 
3 The underlying risks of owning fixed rate instruments, such as bonds and treasuries, are substantially different than those of owning preferred securities (see "About risk"), however, the yield comparison on the previous page serves to demonstrate the potential for preferred securities to outperform bonds and treasuries. In viewing this comparison, investors should note that preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore are subject to greater risk than those debt instruments. 
Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and more complete information about the trust, investors should ask their advisor(s) for a prospectus or download one at invesco.com/uit.
About risk
There is no assurance that the Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. The Portfolio is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value of Portfolio units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in the Portfolio. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Investors could experience dilution of their investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your clients' investment will maintain its proportionate share in the portfolio's profits and losses.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated with an investment in a portfolio of preferred securities, such as the inability of the issuer to pay the principal of or income on a security when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the securities.
The portfolio invests exclusively in preferred securities, including hybrid and trust preferred securities. Hybrid-preferred securities are preferred securities typically issued by corporations, generally in the form of interest-bearing notes or preferred securities and may be perpetual in duration or may have a stated maturity. Trust preferred securities are similar to hybrid securities, but are typically issued by an affiliated business trust of a corporation, generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures or similarly structured securities. Preferred securities do not generally have the growth potential of common stocks. They are also sensitive to interest rate changes and the market price generally falls with rising interest rates. In addition, they are more likely to be called for redemption in a declining interest rate environment. In the event of an issuer's bankruptcy, preferred securities will not be repaid until the issuer's other debt securities, which have priority, have been satisfied. Income payments on most preferreds are non-cumulative and can be deferred indefinitely; distributions on certain hybrid-trust preferreds may generally be deferred without default, although such payments will continue to accrue until paid.
The trust is concentrated in banks and other companies in the financial services industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financial services sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
Securities of foreign companies held by the funds in the portfolio present risks beyond those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include company's foreign market, international trade conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies.
The portfolio will receive early returns of principal if securities are called or sold before the portfolio termination. If this happens your portfolio income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. In addition, the value of your units may decline if any portfolio securities trading at a premium are called at par.
Certain preferred securities in the portfolio are rated below investment grade and considered to be "junk" securities. Securities fated below "BBB-" by Standard and Poor's or below "Baa3" by Moody's are considered to be below investment grade. These securities are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks. Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than with investment grade securities. In addition, these securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal.

Trust objective: The portfolio seeks an attractive level of current income by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of preferred securities. Cohen & Steers, is the Portfolio Consultant. The Sponsor selected the final portfolio based upon the recommendations provided by the Portfolio Consultant.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
The trust should be considered as a part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.
The portfolio does not replicate all of the components of the S&P 500 Buyback Index or its component weightings and the stocks in the portfolio will not change if the index components, or their weightings within the index, change. The performance of the Portfolio will not correspond with the S&P 500 Buyback Index for this reason and because the Portfolio incurs a sales charge and expenses. The Portfolio is not intended to replicate the performance of the index.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee.

Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
