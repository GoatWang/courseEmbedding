The Funds investment objective is long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity securities of Irish companies. The fund is designed for U.S. and other investors who wish to participate in the Irish securities markets. In order to take advantage of significant changes that have occurred in the Irish economy over the past few years and to advance the Funds investment objective, the Funds investment portfolio will have a bias towards both listed and, to a lesser extent, unlisted high-growth Irish companies, drawn primarily from the technology, telecommunications and healthcare sectors. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in equity and fixed income securities of Irish companies. To the extent that the balance of the Funds assets is not so invested, it will have the flexibility to invest the remaining assets in non-Irish companies that are listed on a recognized stock exchange. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in equity securities that are not listed on any securities exchange.

Welcome to The New Ireland Fund

The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company whose objective is long-term appreciation through investment primarily in equity securities of Irish companies.


	Ireland has been one of the strongest growing economies in Europe in recent years while significantly improving its fiscal situation.  Companies have benefitted from business-friendly government policies, strong exports to Europe and the U.S. and a highly qualified, competitive work force.
	
	
	The Fund's investment manager, KBI Global Investors (North America) Ltd., seeks to identify well managed companies with strong economic fundamentals and superior growth characteristics compared to their market valuation.


Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in equity and fixed income securities of Irish companies. To the extent that the balance of the Fund's assets is not so invested, it will have the flexibility to invest the remaining assets in non-Irish companies that are listed on a recognized stock exchange. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets
 in equity securities that are not listed on any securities exchange.

The NAV information is provided by the Fund's accounting agent. The market price is as reported by the exchange on which the Fund trades. This information is unaudited and neither KBI Global Investors (North America) Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Funds, nor any other person guarantees their accuracy.



Rolling 12 Month Performance to June 30, 2017




Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold, may be worth more or less than original cost.  Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.  NAV return data includes investment management fees, custodial charges and administrative fees (such as Director and legal fees) and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions.  The Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.  Returns for less than one year are not annualized.




THE NEW IRELAND FUND UPDATE






	
	Listen to the latest update on the New Ireland Fund, Inc., from Noel O'Halloran, Portfolio Manager for the Fund, who is joined by  Eoin Fahy, Economist, KBI Global Investors.









USEFUL LINKS


Investment Company Institute
Closed-End Fund Association (CEFA)

Fund specific data and performance are provided for informational purposes only and are not intended for trading purposes. The performance shown represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance information shown. Fund returns are annualized for periods longer than one year. Fund returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions, if any, were reinvested. 
 


Net asset value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Market Price is the price at which the Fund's shares are traded on an exchange. Because closed-end fund shares trade on an exchange based on investor demand, the Fund's shares may trade at a price higher or lower than the Fund's NAV. Consequently, a shareholder may be unable to realize the full NAV of the shareholder's shares when the shares are sold.




An investment in the Fund's shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes unpredictably. At any point in time, Fund shares may be worth less than a shareholder's original investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and/or distributions. 

 
 


An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested in the Fund. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and focuses its investments in a single country, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks not associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes and market risks. This may result in greater share volatility. 

 
 


Fund shares are not FDIC-insured and are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any bank.

Fund specific data and performance are provided for informational purposes only and are not intended for trading purposes. The performance shown represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance information shown. Fund returns are annualized for periods longer than one year. Fund returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions, if any, were reinvested. 
  

 Net asset value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.  
  

 Market Price is the price at which the Fund's shares are traded on an exchange. Because closed-end fund shares trade on an exchange based on investor demand, the Fund's shares may trade at a price higher or lower than the Fund's NAV. Consequently, a shareholder may be unable to realize the full NAV of the shareholder's shares when the shares are sold.
  
 
  	An investment in the Fund's shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes unpredictably. At any point in time, Fund shares may be worth less than a shareholder's original investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and/or distributions.  

An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested in the Fund. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and focuses its investments in a single country, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks not associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes and market risks. This may result in greater share volatility.  

Fund shares are not FDIC-insured and are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any bank.

 
The Fund is managed by Kleinwort Benson Investors International Ltd., a subsidiary of Kleinwort Benson Investors Dublin Ltd., and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol - IRL. For further information, please contact the Fund at (800) 468-6475 or investor.query@newirelandfund.com.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  24.90 (07/26/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.55      Market Cap $73.82 M     Shares Outstanding 5.34 M     Public Float 5.30 M     Yield IRL has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.
