Magnus Holding




Company Name : Magnus HoldingAbout Us : The Magnus Company is one of the leading producers of wooden products in Central Poland. The Company was founded in 1986 and in initial stages Magnus Holdingre in the market of pine fronted furniture and other wood based product production. In 1989 substantial growth and manufacture lead to increased production of building woodwork. Four short years later the company required considerable expansion and subsequently purchased the Social Building Company on Warszawska Street 116 in Pabianice. Following refurbishment and general overhaul the substantial building became a wood trade industrial plant, producing and exporting woodwork made of pine plywood. Further growth and development of the company, particularly in the field of woodwork consequently brought about the acquisition of the Furniture Fabric of Lodz in 1995. Immediate modernisation of the premises allowed the production of high quality wooden windows and doors. Essentially The Company's core products are year-long log homes in the Magnus M-BAL System. The innovative technology was created and patented by the proprietor exclusively as the only global building system made of prefabricated timber, filled with M-Term insulation. MAGNUS industrial plants in entirety cover a 15ha area, and have approximately 250 employees on staff. High production capacity allows continuous assembly to a standard of excellence and within a one month period 800m3 of sawn timber is handled. The factory has ecological boilers, sawmill, drying- lumber of 300m3 capacities, state of the art paint shop, researching laboratory and a mechanical workshop manufacturing machines and instrumentation. The factory also has its own side-track, manoeuvring square and warehouses with platforms to reload materials. The location of Magnus Management, Architectural and Commercial office head quarters is in Pabianice. We also created a Magnus exposition of log homes where the value of the M-Bal System technology can be viewed, recognised and appreciated.Product/Service : Timber Homes,Windows,Doors, Furniture,Log Houses,Magnus Homes, M- Log, PVC Windows,Wooden Windows,Aluminium + Wood Windows, Furnitures,Wardrobes,Beds, Tables,Chairs,Shelving,Timber Doors,Wooden Doors,M-Lux, Glass block walls, glass brick walls Country/Region : Poland > Category : Construction & Real EstateContact Person : Mr. Daniel RussellLink More : Poland Construction & Real Estate ,Poland DoorsTelephone : Address : UL.
