Frequently Asked Questions


Where can I order paper?
Paper can be ordered online through our TransAct Supplies website at www.transactsupplies.comWhere can I order parts?
Parts can be ordered online through our TransAct Supplies website at www.transactsupplies.comDo you offer a repair service?
Yes, we offer repair at one of our Repair Centers in and outside the United States. Please use our convenient RMA web form.What communication interface do I have?
The Ithaca 9000 printer can be purchased with several different communication interfaces. Please use the below chart to identify which interface your printer has:
9 pin Serial Interface Cable Required: Serial Null Modem Cable, 9 pin female to 9 pin female. This cable is available for purchase from us. Item No: 10-2020 
 
36 pin Centronics Parallel Interface Cable Required: Parallel Cable, 25 pin male to 36 pin Centronics male. This cable is available for purchase from us. Item No: 253-9800002 
 
USB Interface Cable Required: USB Cable This cable is available for purchase from us. Item No: 98-04322 
 
Ethernet Interface Cable Required: CAT-5 Ethernet cable This cable is not available for purchase from us. 
 
25 pin Parallel Interface Cable Required: Parallel Cable, 25 pin male to 25 pin male. This cable is available for purchase from us. Item No: 253-9800007 
 
25 pin Serial Interface Cable Required: Serial Null Modem Cable, 9 pin female to 25 pin male. This cable is available for purchase from us. Item No: 253-9800006 
 Caution: The 25 pin Parallel and 25 pin Serial interfaces look exactly the same externally. 
They both use a 25 pin D-shell connection. A closer look will reveal that the electronics on the actual interfaces boards are different. The best way to determine which 25 pin communication interface is present in the printer is to print a configuration listing from the printer. This listing will show either RS232 Serial or P1284 Parallel. See Manual Configuration for how to print out this listing. What is the difference between parallel and serial communication?
Parallel and serial communications are two distinct ways of getting data from a PC to our printer. Serial communication transmits data on only 2 wires, one for sending and one for receiving one bit at a time. Parallel communication transmits data across multiple wires simultaneously. This provides a faster means of data transmission than serial. A parallel printer must be connected to a parallel port, commonly labeled as an LPT port on a PC. The LPT port should be set for bi-directional, standard, or SPP. A serial printer must be connected to a serial port, commonly labeled as a COM port on a PC. The COM port settings must match the printer serial settings to communicate properly. Please consult your PC’s literature to learn how to change these setting.What printer driver should I be using?
The correct printer driver depends on what Operating System you are using. You can find the drivers on our website. Drivers & DownloadsWhy won’t my cash drawer open that is connected to my printer?
The Ithaca 9000 printer has an RJ11 cash drawer port for connecting a cash drawer. This port is hard wired for an EPSON configuration. When purchasing a cash drawer to use with this printer, an Epson cash drawer cable must be ordered. Cash drawer cables are not available from TransAct. Once you have the correct cable, you will still need to send the correct cash drawer command code to the printer to open the drawer. The cash drawer code depends on the Emulation Mode the printer is in. This can be determined by printing a configuration listing. See Manual Configuration for how to print out this listing. The follow are the codes for the common Emulation Modes:
Ithaca PCOS Cash Drawer 1 | ASCII : [ESC] x 1 | DECIMAL: 27 120 1 | HEX: 1B 78 01 Cash Drawer 2 | ASCII : [ESC] x 2 | DECIMAL: 27 120 2 | HEX: 1B 78 02
EPSON Cash Drawer 1 | ASCII : [ESC] p 0 | DECIMAL: 27 112 0 | HEX: 1B 70 00 Cash Drawer 2 | ASCII : [ESC] p 1 | DECIMAL: 27 112 1 | HEX: 1B 70 01
Star Cash Drawer 1 | ASCII : [BEL] | DECIMAL: 7 | HEX: 07 Cash Drawer 2 | ASCII : [SUB] | DECIMAL: 26 | HEX: 1A
Microline Cash Drawer 1 | ASCII : [BEL] | DECIMAL: 7 | HEX: 07 Cash Drawer 2 | ASCII : [BS] | DECIMAL: 8 | HEX: 08Why won't my printer cut?
The printer will cut the paper when the printer receives the cut command from the system. This command code depends on the Emulation Mode the printer is in. This can be determined by printing a configuration listing. See Manual Configuration for how to print out this listing. The follow are the codes for the common Emulation Modes:
Ithaca PCOS Cut | ASCII: [ESC] v | DECIMAL: 27 118 | HEX: 1B 76
EPSON Cut | ASCII: [ESC] i | DECIMAL: 27 105 | HEX: 1B 69
Star Cut | ASCII: [ESC] d 0 | DECIMAL: 27 100 0 | HEX: 1B 64 00
Microline Cut | ASCII: [EM] | DECIMAL: 25 | HEX: 19When I print to my Ithaca 9000 printer nothing prints?
The Ithaca 9000 printer is a thermal printer that requires thermal paper. Verify the paper you are using is thermal paper. Make sure the paper is loaded properly. To load paper, simple drop the paper roll into the printer with the paper coming from the bottom of the roll. Pull the paper out a little bit, and close the lid. Printer should cut the paper, and be ready to print. (No error LED, just solid Green LED) Verify you have selected the correct communication port on the system. If the printer has a serial port, make sure you are connected to the serial port of the PC with a serial null-Modem cable. Verify that the configuration settings of the printer are set to the correct Emulation Mode and communication settings for your system. See Manual Configuration for how to print out this listing.In Windows 8.1/Windows 10, my 9000 printer with USB interface is not showing up or reconginzed/assigned on a USB port?
In Windows 8.1/Windows 10, before installation, please change the "USB Mode" option in the internal configuration of the 9000 printer to “USB Printer Only”. See Manual Configuration under the Quick Reference section.NOTE: After you change this option, you must unplug the power cord from the printer, wait at least 15 seconds, then plug the power cord back in. (This updates the interface with the new USB Mode.)Then please follow the Windows Driver Installation Guide under the Drivers section to complete the installation.I have an ethernet interface on my printer, and I can ping to my printer, but I can't print to it. Why?
The most common reason why this happens is because the "Enable bidirectional support" checkbox is checked under the Ports tab in the Properties of your printer. To uncheck this, go to your Printers and Faxes/Devices and Printers page, right click on your printer and select Properties/Printer Properties, click the Ports tab, uncheck the "Enable birdirectional support" checkbox, then click the Apply button, and then click the OK button.Why do I get an �Error encountered in opening lang mon Registry� when trying to save changes in the properties of the Windows driver?
 
The “Lang Mon” error is due to the driver's lack of privileges writing to the registry.
If you encounter this error, please use the “TransactPrinterProperties.exe” program found in the Utilities folder that comes with the Windows drivers.
Note:  You must Right Click the TransactPrinterProperties.exe program and select Run as administrator to allow the changes to be saved to the registry.
 
 
 
 
Change values as you want them, and then click the Save Changes button.
Then Select Yes to allow the Windows Print Spooler to be restarted for the change to take effect.

Back-of-house solutions that drive operational efficiency
The newest addition to the AccuDate line of back-of-house solutions combines the purpose-built, Android-based AccuDate XL terminal with Jolt’s widely used back-of-house operations management software.  This results in an easy to use system that will revolutionize the way you create your food rotation labels and Grab & Go labels. Jolt’s cloud-based administration tool enables you to centrally manage menu items and label designs at a corporate, regional or even local level, making the system ideal for food service operations with tens, hundreds or thousands of locations. And the TransAct AccuDate touch-screen terminal, with its easy to use Android interface and internal thermal printers, makes onsite label printing a breeze.
You can also upgrade to the full Jolt platform and gain additional back-of-house solutions (Temperature Monitoring, Tasks & Checklists, Time & Attendance, Employee Scheduling, and more) that improve operational efficiency even further.
