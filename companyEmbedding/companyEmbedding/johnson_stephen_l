Education and career in industry[edit]
Johnson attended Taylor University, receiving a B.A. in biology followed by a master's degree in pathology from George Washington University. Before working for the U.S. Government, he held a number of positions in laboratory and bio-technology companies. He was also the director of Hazelton Laboratories, now Covance. He has been awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees by Taylor University and Virginia Wesleyan College.[1]
EPA career prior to becoming administrator[edit]
Johnson began working at the EPA in 1979. He had been working at a private lab, Litton Bionetics Inc., in Washington. Johnson said that a mentor suggested he get a job at the EPA, learn about regulations from inside government, and then return to industry. "Regulations were really frustrating," Johnson told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2008, recalling his decision to join the EPA. "I wondered if they really understood what it was like to work in a laboratory."[2]
Johnson's rise from career scientist to EPA chief began in 2001, when he made the jump from civil service bureaucrat to political appointee. In January 2001, Johnson was the lead staff toxics official at EPA. His selection as assistant administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances was set in motion by a Kentucky lobbyist, Charles Grizzle, whose clients have included power companies, hospitals, shopping centers, and a formaldehyde industry association. After the 2000 election, Grizzle called then-senior White House aide Karl Rove and suggested that Rove should take a look at Johnson.[2]
When EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman resigned in 2003, Johnson became the acting deputy administrator, the number two position at EPA, and remained in that position when former Utah governor Michael O. Leavitt was named administrator.
EPA Administrator[edit]
On January 26, 2005, when Leavitt became secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Johnson became acting administrator of EPA.[2] On March 4, 2005, President George W. Bush nominated him formally for the permanent position. He became the first career employee to hold the position of Administrator and the first scientist to head the Agency.
During his April 6, 2005 Senate confirmation hearing, EPA was criticized for support of using human subjects in pesticide testing.[3] Johnson "did not have the opportunity to fully address the committee's criticisms before the hearing was recessed."[4] In April 2005, a secret hold was placed on his confirmation vote while he evaluated the Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study, which advocated recording the effects of pesticides on children from infancy to age 3. In a letter that reached Senator Barbara Boxer several hours after she raised her concerns, Johnson said, "No additional work will be conducted on this study subject to the outcome of external scientific and ethical review."[5] On April 8, Johnson canceled the study. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 29. On February 6, 2006, he issued a final regulation "prohibiting new research involving intentional exposure of pregnant women or children intended for submission to the EPA under the pesticide laws" and other protections.[6]
Johnson tried to block the efforts of 17 states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. He defended his position by arguing that “The Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution, not a confusing patchwork of state rules. I believe this is a better approach than if individual states were to act alone.” The state rules he was blocking were more stringent than the Bush administration's proposed national solution.[7] Johnson came under investigation for allowing the White House to improperly interfere with the decision to grant California a waiver to limit greenhouse gases. On May 20, 2008, Johnson was questioned for three hours by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. On July 29, 2008, four Senators called for Johnson's resignation, alleging he made false statements to Congress.[8]
On December 9, 2008, the Office of Inspector General, US EPA concluded that "EPA's California waiver decision on greenhouse gas automobile emissions met statutory procedural requirements." [9] On May 19, 2009, President Obama also concluded: "a clear and uniform national policy is also good news for the auto industry which will no longer be subjected to a costly patchwork of differing rules and regulations." [10]
Johnson's stance on this and other issues was criticized in an editorial by the scientific journal Nature, which claimed he acted with "reckless disregard for law, science or the agency's own rules — or, it seems, the anguished protests of his own subordinates."[11] In spite of this external criticism and over the objections of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, Energy, Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Council of Economic Advisors, and Small Business Administration, Johnson issued the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, "Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air Act." [12] On February 29, 2008, four labor unions representing 10.000 of the EPA's 17.000 employees (ca. 60%) published an open letter to Johnson, complaining that he had ignored the EPA's official Principles of Scientific Integrity in advancing Bush Administration positions on water fluoridation, pesticide regulation, mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas control.[13]
As Administrator, he managed more than 17,000 Agency employees nationwide and oversaw an annual budget of $7.7 billion. His tenure expired on January 20, 2009.
Post EPA[edit]
On June 29, 2010, clean technology company FlexEnergy announced that Johnson had joined its Board of Directors.[14] According to Johnson, the company's technology can minimize air pollutants in congested cities and industrial sites, as well as provide energy in remote areas around the world.[15]
On November 11, 2010, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company announced that Johnson had been named to its Board of Directors.[16]
Johnson also sits on the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, Taylor University.[17]

Education and career in industry[edit]
Johnson attended Taylor University, receiving a B.A. in biology followed by a master's degree in pathology from George Washington University. Before working for the U.S. Government, he held a number of positions in laboratory and bio-technology companies. He was also the director of Hazelton Laboratories, now Covance. He has been awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees by Taylor University and Virginia Wesleyan College.[1]
EPA career prior to becoming administrator[edit]
Johnson began working at the EPA in 1979. He had been working at a private lab, Litton Bionetics Inc., in Washington. Johnson said that a mentor suggested he get a job at the EPA, learn about regulations from inside government, and then return to industry. "Regulations were really frustrating," Johnson told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2008, recalling his decision to join the EPA. "I wondered if they really understood what it was like to work in a laboratory."[2]
Johnson's rise from career scientist to EPA chief began in 2001, when he made the jump from civil service bureaucrat to political appointee. In January 2001, Johnson was the lead staff toxics official at EPA. His selection as assistant administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances was set in motion by a Kentucky lobbyist, Charles Grizzle, whose clients have included power companies, hospitals, shopping centers, and a formaldehyde industry association. After the 2000 election, Grizzle called then-senior White House aide Karl Rove and suggested that Rove should take a look at Johnson.[2]
When EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman resigned in 2003, Johnson became the acting deputy administrator, the number two position at EPA, and remained in that position when former Utah governor Michael O. Leavitt was named administrator.
EPA Administrator[edit]
On January 26, 2005, when Leavitt became secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Johnson became acting administrator of EPA.[2] On March 4, 2005, President George W. Bush nominated him formally for the permanent position. He became the first career employee to hold the position of Administrator and the first scientist to head the Agency.
During his April 6, 2005 Senate confirmation hearing, EPA was criticized for support of using human subjects in pesticide testing.[3] Johnson "did not have the opportunity to fully address the committee's criticisms before the hearing was recessed."[4] In April 2005, a secret hold was placed on his confirmation vote while he evaluated the Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study, which advocated recording the effects of pesticides on children from infancy to age 3. In a letter that reached Senator Barbara Boxer several hours after she raised her concerns, Johnson said, "No additional work will be conducted on this study subject to the outcome of external scientific and ethical review."[5] On April 8, Johnson canceled the study. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 29. On February 6, 2006, he issued a final regulation "prohibiting new research involving intentional exposure of pregnant women or children intended for submission to the EPA under the pesticide laws" and other protections.[6]
Johnson tried to block the efforts of 17 states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. He defended his position by arguing that “The Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution, not a confusing patchwork of state rules. I believe this is a better approach than if individual states were to act alone.” The state rules he was blocking were more stringent than the Bush administration's proposed national solution.[7] Johnson came under investigation for allowing the White House to improperly interfere with the decision to grant California a waiver to limit greenhouse gases. On May 20, 2008, Johnson was questioned for three hours by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. On July 29, 2008, four Senators called for Johnson's resignation, alleging he made false statements to Congress.[8]
On December 9, 2008, the Office of Inspector General, US EPA concluded that "EPA's California waiver decision on greenhouse gas automobile emissions met statutory procedural requirements." [9] On May 19, 2009, President Obama also concluded: "a clear and uniform national policy is also good news for the auto industry which will no longer be subjected to a costly patchwork of differing rules and regulations." [10]
Johnson's stance on this and other issues was criticized in an editorial by the scientific journal Nature, which claimed he acted with "reckless disregard for law, science or the agency's own rules — or, it seems, the anguished protests of his own subordinates."[11] In spite of this external criticism and over the objections of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, Energy, Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Council of Economic Advisors, and Small Business Administration, Johnson issued the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, "Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air Act." [12] On February 29, 2008, four labor unions representing 10.000 of the EPA's 17.000 employees (ca. 60%) published an open letter to Johnson, complaining that he had ignored the EPA's official Principles of Scientific Integrity in advancing Bush Administration positions on water fluoridation, pesticide regulation, mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas control.[13]
As Administrator, he managed more than 17,000 Agency employees nationwide and oversaw an annual budget of $7.7 billion. His tenure expired on January 20, 2009.
Post EPA[edit]
On June 29, 2010, clean technology company FlexEnergy announced that Johnson had joined its Board of Directors.[14] According to Johnson, the company's technology can minimize air pollutants in congested cities and industrial sites, as well as provide energy in remote areas around the world.[15]
On November 11, 2010, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company announced that Johnson had been named to its Board of Directors.[16]
Johnson also sits on the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, Taylor University.[17]

Education and career in industry[edit]
Johnson attended Taylor University, receiving a B.A. in biology followed by a master's degree in pathology from George Washington University. Before working for the U.S. Government, he held a number of positions in laboratory and bio-technology companies. He was also the director of Hazelton Laboratories, now Covance. He has been awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees by Taylor University and Virginia Wesleyan College.[1]
EPA career prior to becoming administrator[edit]
Johnson began working at the EPA in 1979. He had been working at a private lab, Litton Bionetics Inc., in Washington. Johnson said that a mentor suggested he get a job at the EPA, learn about regulations from inside government, and then return to industry. "Regulations were really frustrating," Johnson told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2008, recalling his decision to join the EPA. "I wondered if they really understood what it was like to work in a laboratory."[2]
Johnson's rise from career scientist to EPA chief began in 2001, when he made the jump from civil service bureaucrat to political appointee. In January 2001, Johnson was the lead staff toxics official at EPA. His selection as assistant administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances was set in motion by a Kentucky lobbyist, Charles Grizzle, whose clients have included power companies, hospitals, shopping centers, and a formaldehyde industry association. After the 2000 election, Grizzle called then-senior White House aide Karl Rove and suggested that Rove should take a look at Johnson.[2]
When EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman resigned in 2003, Johnson became the acting deputy administrator, the number two position at EPA, and remained in that position when former Utah governor Michael O. Leavitt was named administrator.
EPA Administrator[edit]
On January 26, 2005, when Leavitt became secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Johnson became acting administrator of EPA.[2] On March 4, 2005, President George W. Bush nominated him formally for the permanent position. He became the first career employee to hold the position of Administrator and the first scientist to head the Agency.
During his April 6, 2005 Senate confirmation hearing, EPA was criticized for support of using human subjects in pesticide testing.[3] Johnson "did not have the opportunity to fully address the committee's criticisms before the hearing was recessed."[4] In April 2005, a secret hold was placed on his confirmation vote while he evaluated the Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study, which advocated recording the effects of pesticides on children from infancy to age 3. In a letter that reached Senator Barbara Boxer several hours after she raised her concerns, Johnson said, "No additional work will be conducted on this study subject to the outcome of external scientific and ethical review."[5] On April 8, Johnson canceled the study. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 29. On February 6, 2006, he issued a final regulation "prohibiting new research involving intentional exposure of pregnant women or children intended for submission to the EPA under the pesticide laws" and other protections.[6]
Johnson tried to block the efforts of 17 states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. He defended his position by arguing that “The Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution, not a confusing patchwork of state rules. I believe this is a better approach than if individual states were to act alone.” The state rules he was blocking were more stringent than the Bush administration's proposed national solution.[7] Johnson came under investigation for allowing the White House to improperly interfere with the decision to grant California a waiver to limit greenhouse gases. On May 20, 2008, Johnson was questioned for three hours by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. On July 29, 2008, four Senators called for Johnson's resignation, alleging he made false statements to Congress.[8]
On December 9, 2008, the Office of Inspector General, US EPA concluded that "EPA's California waiver decision on greenhouse gas automobile emissions met statutory procedural requirements." [9] On May 19, 2009, President Obama also concluded: "a clear and uniform national policy is also good news for the auto industry which will no longer be subjected to a costly patchwork of differing rules and regulations." [10]
Johnson's stance on this and other issues was criticized in an editorial by the scientific journal Nature, which claimed he acted with "reckless disregard for law, science or the agency's own rules — or, it seems, the anguished protests of his own subordinates."[11] In spite of this external criticism and over the objections of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, Energy, Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Council of Economic Advisors, and Small Business Administration, Johnson issued the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, "Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air Act." [12] On February 29, 2008, four labor unions representing 10.000 of the EPA's 17.000 employees (ca. 60%) published an open letter to Johnson, complaining that he had ignored the EPA's official Principles of Scientific Integrity in advancing Bush Administration positions on water fluoridation, pesticide regulation, mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas control.[13]
As Administrator, he managed more than 17,000 Agency employees nationwide and oversaw an annual budget of $7.7 billion. His tenure expired on January 20, 2009.
Post EPA[edit]
On June 29, 2010, clean technology company FlexEnergy announced that Johnson had joined its Board of Directors.[14] According to Johnson, the company's technology can minimize air pollutants in congested cities and industrial sites, as well as provide energy in remote areas around the world.[15]
On November 11, 2010, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company announced that Johnson had been named to its Board of Directors.[16]
Johnson also sits on the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, Taylor University.[17]

Stephen L. Johnson

Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Biography














October 4, 2006




Stephen L. Johnson
Thank you for joining me.  This is my first opportunity to participate in an Ask the White House forum, and Im excited to discuss Bush Administrations efforts in promoting clean and dependable energy solutions. 

Today, Im pleased to kick off ENERGY STARs annual Change a Light, Change the World campaign.  

Consumers have a choice between installing traditional lighting, or ENERGY STAR qualified lights that protect our environment, promote greater economic security, and put more money in our pockets.  The Change a Light campaign is about getting these lights off the store shelves and into peoples homes.

Saving money, while protecting the environment, is as easy as changing a light.  By encouraging Americans to make smart energy decisions, President Bush and EPA are brightening Americas future - literally - one light at a time.

Now, Id be happy to answer any questions.


Carol, from Annapolis  writes: What is Energy Star?
Stephen L. JohnsonThanks for the question, Carol  this is a great place to start.

ENERGY STAR is a voluntary, federal program run by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy that helps all of us save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices.   

The Bush Administration is a big supporter of ENERGY STAR because it is all about delivering economic and environmental results, without sacrificing performance.  Last year alone, Americans with the help of ENERGY STAR saved $12 billion on their utility bills and prevented greenhouse gas emission equivalent to those from 23 million cars  the number of all the cars in California and Illinois combined. 

When most people hear the name, ENERGY STAR, they probably think about big appliances like refrigerators, air conditioners, or washing machines.  But during the Change a Light campaign, were focusing on an energy user thats often overlooked, but lights up all the rest  home lighting.

For more information on a variety of energy-efficient products that you can use in your home or office, go to www.energystar.gov.
Tim, from Denton, TX
 writes: I've heard a rumor that technology exists which can create lightbulbs
that last for years. Is that true and if so, would they be energy
efficient? 
Stephen L. JohnsonIn this case, the rumors are true.  An ENERGY STAR bulb lasts about 5 years versus an incandescent bulb that burns out in six months to a year.  Plus ENERGY STAR bulbs use 2/3 less power than a conventional bulb.  

Through ENERGY STAR, President Bush and EPA are brightening Americas future  literally  one light at a time.  During the Change a Light, Change the world campaign, we are educating consumers  who, like me, hate replacing their bulbs every few months  to make smart energy solutions for their environment and their wallets.  For every traditional bulb you replace with an ENERGY STAR bulb, youll save $30 on your energy bill over the life of the bulb and prevent the emission of 450 pounds of greenhouse gases  and minimize the number of times you have to climb up on your stepstool to replace those burned-out bulbs.
Mark, from Durham, NC
 writes: There is so much back-and-forth in the media about the nature of global
warming. I know that we will see some fluctations in temperatures around
the globe for a number of reasons, but don't know what to think. Is
global warming all hype, all horror, or somewhere inbetween? Thanks sir.
Mark 
Stephen L. JohnsonPresident Bush understands that the world is going through a period of warming, however the science is still out as to how much it is affected by human activity.  What we do know is that every individual has the power to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by installing energy efficient products with a smaller climate footprint.

The Bush Administration recognizes that America has a significant role to play in reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions we, as a country, release.  That is why we are implementing an aggressive yet practical strategy to reduce emissions while growing the American economy.

Since 2001, the Bush Administration has committed over $26 billion to climate change science, technology and tax incentive programs  more than any other country in the world.  Through programs like ENERGY STAR, we are encouraging consumers and businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, while reducing their energy costs  setting an example for the rest of the world to follow.
Cliff, from Brimfield, Ohio writes: Dr. Johnson: They have Dancing with the Star's and Singing with the
Star's and now we have Energy Star's. and the program with a savings of
energy for 10 MILLION HOMES AND GREENHOUSE GASES OF 12 MILLION CARS. I
would say this is a program that is giving a lot of bang for the buck.
And I hope we keep shooting for the Star's. Is this a long term program
with White House support? Thank You 
Stephen L. JohnsonMy wife says I have two left feet, and an American Idol I am not.  But I do know a thing or two about saving energy and saving money.

Through ENERGY STAR, President Bush and EPA are brightening Americas environmental, economic and energy future one light at a time.  Today, Im encouraging all Americans to join me in taking the Change a Light Pledge at www.energystar.gov, and commit to changing just one traditional light in their home to one thats earned EPAs ENERGY STAR label.

If every American household changed just one bulb, we would save enough power to light more than 2.5 million homes  thats all the homes in Washington, D.C. and the state of Maryland combined.  And by changing just one bulb, homeowners can save more than $30 dollars in electricity costs over the bulbs lifetime, and prevent more than 450 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.

As EPA Administrator and a consumer, I practice what I preach.  Over the years, I have designed and served as the general contractor for several of my familys homes.  In every one, I considered their efficient use of water and energy.  Our current home has won an award for energy efficiency  saving my family hundreds of dollars a year on power costs and limiting its impact on the environment. 
Chris, from Sylacauga,Alabama  writes: Are you the person that can answer my questions? Was the President
impressed with the E85 gasoline that Hoover Police Department is using
in Alabama? Is this something the President is thinking about using
nation wide for our vehicles? 
Stephen L. JohnsonThe President and I applaud any effort to help break Americas dependency on foreign sources of energy.  The President knows our nation is too reliant on foreign energy, and the best way to get off this treadmill of dependency is through innovative fuel technology like E85.  

President Bush set a clear goal in his State of the Union Address last January when he announced a new national investment in energy innovation to accelerate our nations drive towards energy independence.  His Advanced Energy Initiative includes a national goal of replacing more than 75% of our oil imports by the year 2025.  

President Bush and EPA are encouraging the advances in energy innovation that power our nations economy and drive our environmental successes.  Since 2001, under President Bushs leadership, our nation has funded nearly $10 billion in developing energy sources that are cleaner, cheaper and more reliable.  

EPA is building on this progress, and will soon announce a program to promote the use of E85, biodiesel, and the vehicles that use them.  So for now, the Hoover Police Department may have a jump on other parts of the country  but EPA is working to ensure all Americans have access to alternative fuels, and are helping us build toward a clean, secure energy future.
David, from Portland Oregon writes: I am concerned with the way gas prices have gone, and am wondering if
this administration has been finding new ways to fuel our vehicles other
than with oil. I personally like the idea of hydrogen because water is
what is left after it is burned. Are we finding any feasible, less
expensive ways of fueling our nation's vehicles? 
Stephen L. JohnsonThanks, David.  As EPA Administrator, I also envision a future where water is the only emission from our cars.  Although fleets, like some Postal Service trucks here in Washington, D.C., are using hydrogen fuel cells to power their vehicles, the technology is still cost-prohibitive for most uses.    

The Bush Administration is exploring ways to utilize two important alternative fuels  ethanol and biodiesel  renewable fuels that decrease emissions and also decrease our dependency on foreign oil.  Both of these fuels are made from plants - currently, ethanol begins life as corn stalks, and biodiesel comes from soybeans.  EPA is working to increase the supply, availability, and competitiveness of these clean fuels, as well as the cars and trucks that use them.  

EPA and our partners are moving fuel technology breakthroughs from the labs to the streets.  This summer EPA unveiled the most fuel-efficient and cost-effective delivery vehicle in the world.   Utilizing hybrid hydraulic technology, we partnered with UPS to develop a truck with 60-70% better fuel efficiency and 40% lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to a conventional diesel delivery truck.  Laboratory tests show that this hybrid technology has the potential to save more than 1,000 gallons of fuel each year, and over $50,000 in fuel costs over its lifetime.  Imagine the enormous fuel savings for an entire fleet of trucks.
Sandy, from Ohio  writes: I am extremely pleased with the all electric geothermal heatingair
conditioning system we had installed 9 years ago. Everyone told us at
the time all electric was too expensive. During the 9 month heating
season we are charged significantly less by our electric company per
kw-hour than homes that are not all electric. I am the "Thermostat
Watcher" in our house. 
To better control your monthly bill you'll need to close curtains on
windows that let the hot sun shine through, you'll need to add
sweatshirts and or sweatpants during cold weather, but we're for the
most part comfortable. I've found it more efficient and more dependable
than the heat pump we had. Our hot water is also (optionally)
geothermally heated.I don't want to mislead anyone, it is significantly
much more expensive than traditional heatingcooling systems to have
installed. I believe a 30 tax credit for system and install would
generate a lot of interest, 50 credit would generate even more, and
would at the same time make the system more affordable. For anyone
interested just Google "Geothermal" as there is much information
available. 

My question? Why aren't you more actively promoting and advertising this
type of system? I would gladly be your spokesperson :o) This should be
plastered all over the media. 
Stephen L. JohnsonWhat's very exciting to see is a range of new and existing technologies to heat and cool our homes. The Energy Star label can be found on the most efficient of these technologies. In my own home, I have dual-stage heat pumps that are very efficient and effective in heating and cooling my home. The reason why we are here today is because President Bush wants us to promote investments in science and technology that will secure our nation's environmental and energy successes. Geothermal and other energy efficient systems are great examples of technologies that are available today and offer consumers energy efficient solutions.
Jenifer, from china  writes: what have the U.S goverment done to improve the public's sense of
enviroment protection? thank you for you service 
Stephen L. JohnsonUS Environmental Protection Agency is celebrating its' 35th anniversary this year. Our air pollution has been reduced by 50%. Our water is significantly cleaner today than 35 years ago and we have cleaned up, literally thousands of hazardous waste sites around the United States. We have accomplished all of this at the same time as our population has grown 40% and our GDP has grown almost three times.

So, the experience in the United States is that environmental protection and economic growth go hand-in-hand.

P.S. I enjoyed my recent visit to China and am actively cooperating with my colleagues there.
jason, from minnesota  writes: why dont they start making other things more energy efficient like
boats, lawnmowers, and other things we use dailey and use up alot of
gas. Thye boat we use goes through about a tank every 10 hours, and that
would be 34 gallons. the yachts in florida and on the mississippi river
go through event mare then that. If we make this more efficient we will
cut back the use of gas.  Jason 9th grade
Stephen L. JohnsonI agree and the Bush Administration is encouraging the development of more fuel efficient engines for boats, lawn mowers, cars and trucks.
You might be interested to know that at EPA, we have a fuel cell car that we are testing. It runs on hydrogen and the only thing coming out of the tailpipe is water. It produces enough electricity to not only power itself, but has enough to power three-to-five single family homes.

When I was in 9th grade, I read about someday being able to pull your car into the garage, and plug it into the house to charge it. The fuel cell technology that we are researching may allow us to pull our car into the garage and plug the house into the car. I think that's pretty cool!
Keith, from Oakland  writes: Why on earth is this initiative under the mandate of the EPA and not the
DOE? 
Stephen L. JohnsonEnergy Star is a collaborative effort between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. Energy issues can often be environmental issues. President Bush and EPA are cutting our nation's climate footprint by offering consumers environmentally-friendly energy choices. To learn about Energy Star, you can visit the Web
site: www.energystar.gov.
Charles, from Chevy Chase
 writes: Whats your favorite energy star product? Do you have any in your home?
Do they make energy star power tools? 
Stephen L. JohnsonMy laptop computer because I use it so much. It is a hard choice because I have so many Energy Star products in my home. In fact, a number of years ago our home won an energy efficiency award. While we don't certify power tools, we do evaluate and qualify their external power sources (their chargers) as Energy Star qualified products. Keep a watchful eye for new Energy Star products by looking for the blue Energy Star label.
You can learn more about all the products at the Energy Star Web site.
Nick, from Fort Worth, TX
 writes: A good portion of lighting fixtures in today's homes are of the dimmable
variety. When will dimmable CFL's become cost-effective? Most of these I
have found are $20 are more. 
Stephen L. JohnsonMany compact fluorescent lights that have earned the governments Energy Star are available as dimmable lights. The best way to know is to look for the blue Energy Star logo and make sure the packaging says they are dimmable. My experience as a consumer is that the costs continue to come down, as is often the case with newer technologies.

President Bush and EPA are encouraging consumers to get the most out of their energy dollars, so Change a Light and Change the World.




Stephen L. Johnson
Thank you all for your great questions.  I always say that environmental responsibility is everyones responsibility  and the only way to meet this challenge is by being informed.  

I encourage all Americans to do as I have and take the ENERGY STAR Change a Light Pledge at www.energystar.gov, committing to change just one traditional light in your home to one thats earned EPAs ENERGY STAR label.

Saving energy and saving money just makes sense  and by taking a few seconds to change a bulb in our homes, together we can help brighten Americas future one light at a time.

Thanks and I hope to see you again on-line soon.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Johnson Stephen L carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Johnson Stephen L currently holds license 5789, ME-5789 (Me Master Electrician, Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Johnson Stephen L



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Johnson Stephen L



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Johnson Stephen L



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
