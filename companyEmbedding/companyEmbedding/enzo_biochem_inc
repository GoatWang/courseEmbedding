Enzo Biochem Rounds The Corner - Enzo Biochem, Inc. (NYSE:ENZ) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Enzo Biochem Rounds The CornerJul.10.17 | About: Enzo Biochem, (ENZ) Strong Bio Long only, biotech, Growth, contrarianSummaryEnzo diagnostics platforms are expanding, revenues are increasing, and costs are decreasing.
        Enzo has a competitive price-point advantage and market penetration.
        Set to serve impressively large markets, Enzo is well-positioned to expand into your investment portfolio.
        Enzo Biochem, Inc. (ENZ) is a $550 million market cap company focused on gene regulation and gene modification technologies. Specifically, Enzo has developed into a leader in the field of recombinant DNA technology, a major space in modern medicine. The key to their business has been generating very low cost physician-based MDx diagnostic platforms that are highly sensitive, versatile, and compatible with current open systems. In many cases ENZ offers its clients savings of 30-50% versus competitors. The company has made its state-of-the-art laboratory capabilities available on a reference basis, enabling other labs to meet client-physician needs in a more affordable manner, in this space of competitively squeezed reimbursements. The company is focused on streamlining product distribution and developing new diagnostics tools to expand its market. ENZ stock has increased about 100% over the past year, and the company has reported improved operating results. Main growth drivers for the company are in the women’s health space where ENZ has increased its market share in New York, with New York State Department of Health having recently granted conditional approvals for infectious disease. The company’s cost efficient AmpiProbe® PCR platform is expanding its specialized 14-analyte panel with three new diagnostics anticipated to be generating revenue by end Q3 2017. The diagnostic product expansion was for real-time PCR-based diagnostics for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis.  ENZ reported that these are just a few of the diagnostic products to be released in its long line of product developments to come.  In addition to these products, the company is developing assays in its flow cytometry platform. Flow cytometry can be used in large market applications such as cancer detection, infectious disease, inflammatory bowel disease, urology, HIV, diabetes, immune disorders, bone disorders, and hematopathology. Enzo also is developing a line of diagnostic products examining biopsy specimens for oncology. According to the company, molecular-based laboratory service U.S. products have a market currently estimated to be in excess of $3 billion.
 1Q 2017 revenues were reported at $27 million. The company generated clinical lab revenues of $19.6 million, an 8% growth over prior year period, and represents a sixth straight quarterly increase. Gross margins are increasing for the company as well. Life sciences business revenue decreased 9% to $7.5 million citing weakness in academic and government markets, but remains a profitable segment. Having displayed lower operating costs, the company was essentially cash neutral, having turned the corner over last year period which had a $0.05 per share quarterly loss. From a market standpoint, treatment-resistant strains offer the infectious disease diagnosis market space prospects for growth, with genetic testing approaches confirming several advantages. Genetic testing approaches can screen panels of known mutants as built-in features of a testing platform, whereas immuno-markers may fall short without a cocktail of expensive and wasteful tests as a built-in feature. However, markets for infectious disease and biomarker diagnostics are extremely competitive, with advances having led to declining margins for a number of years, and it seems unlikely that new players can even target the space. At the turn of the century biomarker diagnostics was a hot space and there was no shortage of companies wanting in (or analyst coverage), but consolidation, licensing, and acquisitions have streamlined the segment, and the mature species of diagnostics firms has now been "selected". Immunoassays still dominate the space, but genetic screening technologies have emerged due to technical advantages such as panel analysis, cost-driven factors, and honestly the absolute passion of the genetic engineers who recognized its potential and developed the technology to be so sensitive. Being efficient was the key to survival, and ENZ has succeeded in cost-point and physician-patient availability, having been named as in-network provider for the 4th largest national insurer, two critical competitive factors.
  Genetic diagnostics as an industry got a lot of coverage by analysts about ten years ago, as did ENZ, but it doesn't appear to be getting all that much follow-up attention right now, ironically, even though the market is finally telling us opportunity may be passing. Strong Bio regards this as a good potential watchlist candidate for all of the reasons stated above. Additionally, it is possible that acquisition of this infectious disease leader by the "one-stop shopping" push for consolidation in DNA diagnostics could reel ENZ in as part of a larger operation. Strong Bio sees an opportunity for whole-genome screening leaders, tumor ctDNA leaders, and infectious disease leaders to merge and dominate the genetic diagnostic space in the coming decade. Risks for the company remains in that it is an incredibly competitive space. But much of the competitive risk has been resolved due to the critical cost-point and market penetration work that the company has performed. With $62 million in cash and cash equivalents it does not seem likely they would need to raise capital, but it is a possibility if the company wants to expand into a new space that requires significant investment. Reward to risk ratio is as good as one could expect for the industry. There is a significant risk in that some competitors have purportedly infringed upon the company's patents for DNA detection. The company feels that the courts have made errors in its early rulings against Enzo, but the trend in DNA-related legal judgments have been competition-supportive. Perhaps opportunity-promoting legal influence can provide better medical care for patients in the long run. In either case the competitive space has yet to work out some of the proprietary boundaries and remains a risk factor for ENZ investment.

About Us







Enzo Biochem is a leading life sciences and biotechnology company focused on harnessing genetic processes to develop research tools, diagnostics and therapeutics and provides reference laboratory services to the medical community. Founded in 1976, we have concentrated on the development of enabling technologies in the areas of gene regulation and gene modification. Many of our technologies are applicable to the biomedical and pharmaceutical research markets, and we are further using these technologies as a platform for our entry into the clinical diagnostics market. Today, Enzo technologies and products are recognized as the key tools in non-radioactive gene labeling used by researchers worldwide. Additionally, Enzo's work in gene analysis has led to development of a number of significant therapeutic candidates for the treatment of viral and immunological based disorders, several of which are in various phases of human clinical trials. In the course of our extensive research and development activities, we have built a significant patent position consisting of numerous pioneer patents and applications that encompass our core technologies.
The business activities of Enzo Biochem are performed by the company's three wholly owned subsidiaries... Enzo Life Sciences, Enzo Therapeutics and Enzo Clinical Labs. Such activities include research and development, manufacturing and marketing of biomedical research products and tools through Enzo Life Sciences and research and development of therapeutic products through Enzo Therapeutics and the operation of a regional clinical reference laboratory through Enzo Clinical Labs.
Enzo's vision of the importance of recombinant DNA technology as an informational source more than two decades ago has now become a major direction in modern medicine.

Recent acquisitions






2007 Alexis Corporation, Axxora LLC, and Apotech








ALEXIS  Corporation was founded during 1993/1994 in Switzerland and  the USA by a  team of experts in the field of life science research  reagents. Over  the following years the company built a fast growing and  comprehensive  product line to serve the life science research market.  Starting as an  in-licensing, OEM and trading business, ALEXIS  Corporation developed and  acquired its own in-house manufacturing  capabilities. By leveraging its  own production with a series of  proprietary product licensing  arrangements with universities, research  institutes, as well as biotech  and biopharmaceutical companies, the  brand ALEXIS® Biochemicals  developed a strong reputation among  researchers for providing the most  innovative products within its  chosen market segments.In April 2005  ALEXIS® Biochemicals was  enhanced by the merger with the Swiss company  Apotech Corporation, a  life science reagents company, discovering,  developing and producing  new products in the field of immunology,  apoptosis, and inflammation.








2008 – Biomol International LP








Biomol  International was formed by the merger of two leading companies in  cellular biochemistry in 2004. Biomol Research Laboratories Inc., based  in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, USA, was founded in 1983 focusing on  the supply of innovative signal transduction reagents to the life  science research market, while Affiniti Research Products Ltd., based in  Exeter, UK, was founded in 1991 as a supplier of products and services  to the neuroscience sector of the life science research market. The  brand BIOMOL® International continued to serve the cellular biochemistry  sector of the life science research market with innovative research  products and services launching hundreds of new products every year.








2009 – Assay Designs Inc. and Stressgen Bioreagents








Founded in 1992 in Athens, Georgia then re-located to Ann Arbor, Michigan, Assay Designs® began as a small company with the goal of providing high quality, easy-to-use assay kits and highly characterized reagents to the life sciences research market. The portfolio of kits grew from the first PGE2 EIA kit to the present offering of over 200 assays for biomarkers relevant to inflammation and immunity, oxidative and cellular stress, steroid and hormone biology, cell signaling, and metabolism ELISA Kits. The Assay Designs acquisition of Stressgen Bioreagents in 2005 incorporated the definitive collection of Stressgen® brand antibodies, proteins, and kits for heat shock proteins, chaperones, and mediators of cellular stress to complement its product portfolio.

Enzo Biochem


Enzo Biochem is a leading life sciences and biotechnology company focused on harnessing genetic processes to develop research tools, diagnostics and therapeutics and provides reference laboratory services to the medical community. Founded in 1976, we have concentrated on the development of enabling technologies in the areas of gene regulation and gene modification. Many of our technologies are applicable to the biomedical and pharmaceutical research markets, and we are further using these technologies as a platform for our entry into the clinical diagnostics market. Today, Enzo technologies and products are recognized as the key tools in non-radioactive gene labeling used by researchers worldwide. Additionally, Enzo's work in gene analysis has led to development of a number of significant therapeutic candidates for the treatment of viral and immunological based disorders, several of which are in various phases of human clinical trials. In the course of our extensive research and development activities, we have built a significant patent position consisting of numerous pioneer patents and applications that encompass our core technologies.

The business activities of Enzo Biochem are performed by the company's three wholly owned subsidiaries . . . Enzo Life Sciences, Enzo Therapeutics and Enzo Clinical Labs. Such activities include research and development, manufacturing and marketing of biomedical research products and tools through Enzo Life Sciences and research and development of therapeutic products through Enzo Therapeutics and the operation of a regional clinical reference laboratory through Enzo Clinical Labs.

Enzo's vision of the importance of recombinant DNA technology as an informational source more than two decades ago has now become a major direction in modern medicine.
