Take An Exam
Interested in taking an ETA certification exam? Once you have decided which ETA certification exam(s) you would like to take, find   an ETA test site near you to take the exam.
Next, you must decide whether to take the exam online with Trapeza, ETA's online testing site, or on paper. A Certification Administrator must be present no matter which   method of testing you select. You will then need to schedule a time to take the   exam with your chosen Certification Administrator.
ETA is also one of only 13 FCC COLEMs approved to administer FCC licenses in the United States. You can take an FCC license exam at most Certification Administrator locations.
