SUPPLEMENT DATED JANUARY 1, 2006 TO 
PROSPECTUS DATED MAY 1, 2005
 
INHERITANCE BUILDER PLUSSM
 
Issued through
 
Transamerica Life Insurance Company
 
 
Effective on or about February 1, 2006, We will offer a new Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider for long-term care that may be purchased with the Policy.  Also effective on or about February 1, 2006, the Accelerated Death Benefit Rider will no longer be available for new sales.  
 
The following is added to the beginning of the fifth bullet in the prospectus on page 1 under the section entitled “Policy Benefits – Variable Death Benefit”:
 
Effective on or about February 1, 2006, the Accelerated Death Benefit Rider is no longer available for new sales.
 
The following bullet is added after the sixth bullet in the prospectus on page 1 under the section entitled “Policy Benefits – Variable Death Benefit”:
 
</R>



  

• 

Effective on or about February 1, 2006, you may exercise the Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider for long-term care, if such rider was purchased with the Policy.  The Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider accelerates payment of a portion of the Death Benefit under the Policy when the Insured becomes eligible for benefits by being certified as a Chronically Ill Individual and Confined to a Nursing Facility or Assisted Living Facility or receiving Home Health Care or Adult Day Care, subject to terms and conditions defined in the rider.  We believe the benefit paid under this rider is generally not subject to tax.  However, various factors such as certain business uses of the rider or the amount of other long-term care insurance on the Insured may cause the benefit to be taxable.  You should consult your tax advisor.  
<R>
 
The following table is added to the fee tables in the prospectus on page 5 under the section entitled “Fee Tables – Periodic Charges Other Than Portfolio Operating Expenses”:

The following is added in the prospectus on page 12 under the section entitled “Charges and Deductions – Rider Charges”:
 
Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider.  If you purchase the optional Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider, we will assess an additional charge that is a percentage of the Initial premium paid for your Policy at issue (as shown in the chart below), unless the state where we issued your Policy requires otherwise.

The following is added in the prospectus on page 23 under the section entitled “Death Benefit – Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider”:
 
Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider
 
You may exercise the simplified issue Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider for long-term care for issue ages 30 - 79, if such rider was purchased with the Policy. The Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit accelerates payment of a portion of the Death Benefit under the Policy. Benefits under the rider are payable monthly to the Owner and are a percentage (maximum of 2% or 4%) of the Initial premium.  The Insured becomes eligible for benefits under the Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider by being certified as a Chronically Ill Individual and by being confined to a Nursing or Assisted Living Facility, or by receiving Home Health Care from a Home Health Agency or Adult Day Care in an Adult Day Care Center.  If you purchase the optional Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider, we will assess an additional charge that is a percentage of the Initial premium paid for your Policy at issue
(as shown in the chart below), unless the state where we issued your Policy requires otherwise.
 



Charge for Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider  


Gender / Benefit 

4% / 2% Acceleration Benefit 

2% / 1% Acceleration Benefit  


Male 

4.0% 

3.0%  


Female 

7.0% 

5.0%  
 
If the 2%/1% benefit is chosen at issue the benefit amount for a Nursing Home or Assisted Living Facility would equal the lesser of 2% of the initial specified amount or $5,000.  For Adult Day Care or Home Health Care, the benefit amount would equal the lesser of 1% of initial specified amount or $2,500.
 
If the 4%/2% benefit is chosen at issue, the benefit amount for a Nursing Home or Assisted Living Facility would equal the lesser of 4% of the initial specified amount or $5,000.  For Adult Day Care or Home Health Care, the benefit amount would equal the lesser of 2% of initial specified amount or $2,500.
 
The benefit provided is a monthly benefit that is paid to the Owner regardless of actual expenses incurred by the Insured.  The monthly benefit is set based on the initial specified amount and is level during the claim period, unless a withdrawal (i.e., a partial surrender or any acceleration of the death benefit under the Policy under any other rider available under the Policy) is taken.  If no withdrawal is taken, the entire initial specified amount is available for eventual acceleration, and the maximum total Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider benefits paid will be the initial specified amount.  If withdrawals are taken, however, the amount available for acceleration is reduced on a pro-rata basis.  
 
Each rider benefit we pay will reduce the Policy’s death benefit, specified amount, Cash Value, Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, surrender charge, or any indebtedness.
 



  

• 

The Death Benefit under the Policy will be reduced by the amount paid under the Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider.  If the Insured dies while the Policy is in force and while benefits under the rider are being paid, the remaining death benefit proceeds will be paid to the Beneficiary and no further payments under this rider will be made to you.  However, if the entire death benefit proceeds are paid under the terms of the rider prior to the Insured’s death, the Policy will terminate and there will be no death benefit payable upon the Insured’s death.  
 
Benefits under the Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider are not intended to be considered taxable income to you.  However, benefits paid under this rider may be considered taxable income to you.  We urge you to consult your personal tax advisor or attorney about the tax treatment of the benefits paid under this rider given your own circumstances.
 



  

• 

The specified amount of the Policy, the Cash Value, the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit under the Policy, and the surrender charge under the Policy each will be reduced proportionately to the reduction in the death benefit under the Policy as a result of each rider benefit amount paid.  
 



  

• 

If there is any indebtedness under the Policy, a pro-rata portion of each rider benefit amount paid will be used to repay a portion of any indebtedness under the Policy.  For example, if the death benefit was $100,000 and the outstanding debt was $10,000, the monthly payment of $2,000 would be reduced by $200 to help pay off the loans.  
</R>

<R>

Once benefit payments begin, we will provide you with a monthly report that shows the effect of each rider benefit payment on the Policy.
 
The following bullet is added in the prospectus on page 31 under the section entitled “Other Policy Information – Riders”:
 



  

• 

The Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider accelerates payment of a portion of the death benefit under the Policy to the Owner as reimbursement of certain charges incurred by the Insured for long-term care.  Benefits under this rider may be payable monthly.  
</R>
 
<R>
The following is added to the first paragraph on page 6 of the prospectus under the heading “Transamerica, the Variable Account, the Fixed Account and the Portfolios” – “Transamerica Life Insurance Company”:
 
Transamerica Life Insurance and Annuity Company (“TALIAC”) was merged into Transamerica, an affiliate, on October 1, 2005.

Item 29. 

Indemnification  
 
The Iowa Code (Sections 490.850 et. seq.) provides for permissive indemnification in certain situations, mandatory indemnification in other situations, and prohibits indemnification in certain situations.  The Code also specifies procedures for determining when indemnification payments can be made.
 
Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of Transamerica pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, Transamerica has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by Transamerica of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of Transamerica in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, Transamerica will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to
a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an Applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Applicants' Representations:

1. TLIC is the depositor of Account VA-2L. TFLIC is the depositor of Account VA-2LNY. Each Company is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of AEGON, N.V.
2. Each Account is a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act, and each is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. Each Account is divided into sub-accounts, which reflect the investment performance of certain registered investment companies, including Transamerica Series Trust. The Accounts are administered and accounted for as part of the general business of the Companies. The application sets forth the registration statement file numbers for the security interests under the Contracts and the Accounts.
3. The Contracts are individual and group variable annuity contracts. Each of the prospectuses for the Contracts discloses that the issuing Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another registered open-end management investment company for shares of a registered open-end management investment company held by a sub-account of an Account.
4. Transamerica Series Trust is an open-end management investment company of the series type that is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-04419).[1] 
           Shares of the series are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 033-00507) and are sold to the separate accounts of life insurance companies to fund benefits under variable life policies or variable annuity contracts and to certain affiliated asset allocation funds.
5. Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), an investment adviser that is registered with the Commission, has overall responsibility for the management of each Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Fund. TAM delegates to a sub-adviser the responsibility for day-to-day management of the investments of each Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Fund, subject to TAM's oversight. TAM may, in the future, determine to provide the day-to-day management of any Start Printed Page 15736Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Fund without the use of a sub-adviser.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Funds for shares of the Existing Funds (“Substitutions”) to fund the Contracts:
Existing fundReplacement fundDreyfus Variable Investment Fund: Appreciation Portfolio (Service Shares)Transamerica WMC US Growth VP (Service Class).Dreyfus Variable Investment Fund: Quality Bond Portfolio (Service Shares)Transamerica JPMorgan Core Bond VP (Service Class).Dreyfus Investment Portfolios: Core Value Portfolio (Service Shares)Transamerica Barrow Hanley Dividend Focused VP (Initial Class).The Dreyfus Socially Responsible Growth Fund, Inc. (Service Shares)Transamerica WMC US Growth VP (Service Class).
7. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Funds have investment objectives, policies and risk profiles, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially the same as, or sufficiently similar to, the corresponding Existing Funds to make those Replacement Funds appropriate candidates as substitutes. Applicants also state that the investment objectives and investment strategies of each Replacement Fund are similar to the corresponding Existing Fund, or each Replacement Fund's underlying portfolio construction and investment results are similar to those of the Existing Fund, and therefore the fundamental objectives, risk, and performance expectations of those Contract owners with interests in sub-accounts of the Existing Funds will continue to be met after the Substitutions.
8. The investment objectives of each Existing Fund and its corresponding Replacement Fund are set forth below. Additional information for each Existing Fund and Replacement Fund, including principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
Existing fundReplacement fundDreyfus Variable Investment Fund: Appreciation Portfolio seeks long-term capital growth consistent with the preservation of capitalTransamerica WMC US Growth VP seeks to maximize long-term growth.Dreyfus Variable Investment Fund: Quality Bond Portfolio seeks to maximize total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current incomeTransamerica JPMorgan Core Bond VP seeks total return, consisting of current income and capital appreciation.Dreyfus Investment Portfolios: Core Value Portfolio seeks long-term growth of capital, with current income as a secondary objectiveTransamerica Barrow Hanley Dividend Focused VP seeks total return gained from the combination of dividend yield, growth of dividends and capital appreciation.The Dreyfus Socially Responsible Growth Fund, Inc. seeks to provide capital growth, with current income as a secondary goalTransamerica WMC US Growth VP seeks to maximize long-term growth.
9. Applicants state that the Substitutions are designed to allow Contract owners to continue their investment in similar or better investment options without interruption and at no additional cost to them. Contract owners with sub-account balances invested through the Accounts in shares of the Replacement Funds will have the same or lower total expense ratios taking into account fund expenses (including Rule 12b-1 fees, if any). With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Fund are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Fund. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Fund and its corresponding Replacement Fund in greater detail.
10. Applicants represent that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Effective Date”) shares of the Existing Funds will be redeemed for cash. The Companies, on behalf of each Existing Fund sub-account of each relevant Account, will simultaneously place a redemption request with each Existing Fund and a purchase order with the corresponding Replacement Fund so that the purchase of Replacement Fund shares will be for the exact amount of the redemption proceeds. Thus, Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
11. The Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value (in accordance with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act) with no change in the amount of any affected Contract owner's contract value, cash value, accumulation value, account value or death benefit or in dollar value of his or her investment in the applicable Accounts.[2] 
           No brokerage commissions or other fees will be paid by either the Existing Funds or the Replacement Funds or by the affected Contract owners in connection with the Substitutions.
12. The affected Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions nor will their rights or the Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. The Companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses. The Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by affected Contract owners to be greater after the Substitutions than before the Substitutions. Moreover, the Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on affected Contract owners.
13. As described in the application, after notification of the Substitution and for 30 days after the Effective Date, affected Contract owners may reallocate the sub-account value of an Existing Fund to any other investment option available under their Contract without incurring any transfer charges.Start Printed Page 15737

14. All Contract owners affected by the Substitutions will be notified of this application by means of supplements to the Contract prospectuses at least 30 days prior to the Effective Date. The notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the notice until the Effective Date, owners are permitted to make one transfer of Contract value out of the Existing Fund sub-account to one or more other sub-accounts without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that the Companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the Effective Date.
15. If affected Contract owners reallocate account value during this 60 day period, there will be no charge for the reallocation of accumulated value from the Existing Fund sub-accounts and the reallocation will not count as a transfer when imposing any applicable restriction or limit under the Contract on transfers. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Funds at least 30 days before the Effective Date.
16. Within five (5) business days after the Effective Date, affected Contract owners will be sent a written confirmation, which will include confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified, a restatement of the information set forth in the pre-Substitution notice and values of the Contract owner's position in the Existing Fund before the Substitution and the Replacement Fund after the Substitution.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the Substitutions. Section 26(c) requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust. Section 26(c) requires the Commission to issue such an order if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
2. Applicants submit that the terms and conditions of the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that the replacement of an Existing Fund with the corresponding Replacement Fund is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. As described in the application, for a period of two years following the Effective Date, the Companies or their affiliates will reimburse any Contract owner affected by the proposed Substitutions involving Transamerica Series Trust Replacement Funds and whose sub-account invests in the Replacement Fund to the extent a Replacement Fund's net annual operating expenses exceeds the net annual operating expenses of the corresponding Existing Fund. Applicants further assert that each Replacement Fund has similar investment objectives and investment strategies as the corresponding Existing Fund, or each Replacement Fund's underlying portfolio construction and investment results are similar to those of the corresponding Existing Fund. Accordingly, Applicants believe that the fundamental investment objectives, risk and performance expectations of the Contract owners will continue to be met after the Substitutions.
3. Applicants also maintain that it is in the best interests of the Contract owners to substitute the Replacement Fund for its corresponding Existing Fund. Applicants anticipate that the substitution of an Existing Fund with the corresponding Replacement Fund will result in a Contract that is administered and managed more efficiently, and one that is more competitive with other variable products. The rights of affected Contract owners and the obligations of the Companies under the Contracts will not be altered by the Substitutions. Affected Contract owners will not incur any additional tax liability or any additional fees and expenses as a result of the Substitutions.
4. Each of the prospectuses for the Contracts discloses that the issuing Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another registered open-end management investment company for shares of an open-end management investment company held by a sub-account of an Account.
5. Applicants also assert that none of the proposed Substitutions is of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Unlike a traditional unit investment trust where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust, the Contracts provide each Contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer account values into other sub-accounts. Moreover, the Contracts will offer affected Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected sub-accounts into any of the remaining sub-accounts without cost or other disadvantage. The Substitution, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemptions that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Applicants also maintain that the Substitutions are unlike the type of substitutions which Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a Contract, Contract owners select much more than a particular registered management open-end investment company in which to invest their account values. They also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the Companies under their Contracts as well as other rights and privileges set forth in the Contracts.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The proposed Substitutions will not be effected unless the Companies determine that: (a) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (b) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (c) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. The Companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the Contract owners to effect the Substitutions.
3. The proposed Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
4. The proposed Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for affected Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
5. The rights or obligations of the Companies under the Contracts of Start Printed Page 15738affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
6. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the sub-account investing in the Existing Fund (before the Effective Date) or the Replacement Fund (after the Effective Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Effective Date through at least 30 days following the Effective Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Company will not exercise any right it may have under the Contract to impose restrictions on transfers between the sub-accounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Effective Date through at least 30 days following the Effective Date.
7. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Effective Date about: (a) The intended substitution of Existing Funds with the Replacement Funds; (b) the intended Effective Date; and (c) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 6 above. In addition, the Companies will deliver to all affected Contract owners, at least 30 days before the Effective Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Fund.
8. The Companies will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five (5) business days of the Effective Date a written confirmation which will include: (a) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (b) a restatement of the information set forth in the pre-Substitution notice; and (c) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Fund before the Substitution and the Replacement Fund after the Substitution.
9. After the Effective Date the Applicants agree not to change a Replacement Fund's sub- adviser without first obtaining shareholder approval of either (a) the sub-adviser change or (b) the parties' continued ability to rely on their manager-of-managers exemptive order.
10. For two years following the Effective Date the net annual expenses of each Replacement Fund that is a Transamerica Series Trust Fund will not exceed the net annual expenses of the corresponding Existing Fund as of the fund's most recent fiscal year. To achieve this limitation, the Replacement Fund's investment adviser will waive fees or reimburse the Replacement Fund in certain amounts to maintain expenses at or below the limit. Any adjustments will be made at least on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges, including asset based charges such as mortality expense risk charges deducted from the sub-accounts that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Effective Date.

2.
     Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Funds and Replacement Funds, which Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

27.     Number of Contract Owners  As of December 31, 2002, there were 7,286 Contract owners.  Item 28.     Indemnification  The Iowa Code (Sections 490.850 et. seq.) provides for permissive indemnification in certain situations, mandatory indemnification
in other situations, and prohibits indemnification in certain situations. The Code also specifies producers for determining when indemnification payments can be made.   
C-25 


 Insofar as
indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Depositor has been advised that in the
opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
by the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered), the Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.  Item 29.     Principal
Underwriters                        AFSG Securities Corporation                       4333 Edgewood Road, N.E.                       Cedar Rapids, Iowa
