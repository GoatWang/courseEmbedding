History[edit]
As Creative Computers Inc.[edit]




Frank Khulusi - CEO and founder of PCM Inc.


The company now known as PCM was founded by two brothers, Sam and Frank Khulusi, in 1987 under the name of “Creative Computers”. Creative Computers was launched from the founders’ residence in Marina Del Rey, CA. The company was set up as a mail order catalog company whereby products are advertised through paper flyers/catalogs. Interested customers called in their orders through the provided toll-free "1-800" phone number.[2] The founders then took the order and placed purchase orders to acquire sold products, bill the customers’ credit card and ship the products to the customers. At startup, the company’s catalog consisted of one brand of computers “Amiga” made by Commodore International. The company became the number one mail order reseller of Amiga computers. In 1993/1994 Commodore went through financial difficulties, which caused it to close its operation in April 1994.
In early 1994, PC Mall obtained authorization to sell Apple computers through its mail order catalog model. The authorization came at an opportune time as the Commodore operation was soon to close. With the Apple authorization and the anticipated growth, PC Mall moved its operation from the back of a retail store to a call center with over 100 seats, a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) distribution center, and over 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) of corporate office space.
In first quarter of 1995, the company filed for its initial public offering and went public in April 1995.
Growth and Acquisitions[edit]
In early 1995, the company expanded its catalog to include PC Wintel products as well. To support the growth, the company moved its distribution center to a 212,000-square-foot (19,700 m2) distribution center next to FedEx hub in Memphis, TN in the third quarter of 1995. In addition to the millions of catalogs mailed monthly, the company launched its first web sites macmall.com and pcmall.com in 1996.
In 1996/1997, the company acquired Computability, a Milwaukee-based company,[3] and Elek-Tek, a Chicago-based company, both dealing primarily with PC Wintel products.
In 2001, the company acquired Wareforce, a southern California-based company. Then, in 2002, the company acquired Club Mac, another southern California-based operation.[4]
In 2011, the company launched its website onSale.com, which focuses on daily deals and electronic products, via the Internet.
In third quarter of 2006, PC Mall Gov, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PC Mall, Inc., acquired the product business of GMRI, a Virginia-based company. GMRI provides IT consulting and technology solutions for Federal agencies.[5]
Then in the third quarter of 2007, the company acquired SARCOM, which was based in Lewis Center, Ohio, into which Wareforce’s operations were subsequently folded. Focusing on enterprise-level businesses, SARCOM offers technology products and services. The Abreon Group, a division of SARCOM, is a consulting and training operation for mid-market and enterprise businesses.
In December 2009, the company acquired the assets of Data Systems Worldwide (DSW), a converged networking company, and in June 2010, they acquired NSPI, a managed services company. Both DSW and NSPI’s operations are now secured under the SARCOM subsidiary.
Venturing into the realm of social networking for the first time, the company launched their Small Business Network, or SBN, in 2009. SBN is an online meeting place catering to the needs of small businesses and small business owners.
The company started HealthDynamix, based in Manassas, Virginia, in early 2010. This division provides information technologies and services for healthcare and medical industries.
In December 2012, the company changed its corporate name to PCM, Inc. from PC Mall, Inc. In connection with the rebranding, effective January 2, 2013, PCM Common Stock commenced trading on NASDAQ under the ticker PCMI and no longer trades under the prior ticker of MALL.[6]
In April 2015, PCM completed its acquisition of IT solutions provider, En Pointe Technologies Sales, Inc. based in Gardena, California. The assets were acquired by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PCM, which now operates under the En Pointe brand.[7]
In November 2015, PCM acquired the North American business-to-business operations of Systemax, including TigerDirect, for $14 million.[8]
In January 2017, PCM acquired Canadian Microsoft Cloud solutions leader, Stratiform inc for C$2.1Million.[9]
Hybrid Cloud Data Center[edit]
In December 2012, PCM completed the purchase of 7.9 acres of land towards the construction of a new cloud data center that it opened in late June 2014.[10] The Tier III facility is strategically located in a data center-centric development in New Albany, Ohio. The new facility is said to complement its two existing data centers and a 24/7 Integrated Operations Center (IOC) located in Atlanta, Georgia, enhancing PCM managed service offerings, including cloud services, data center hosting and management, remote monitoring and disaster recovery.

History[edit]
As Creative Computers Inc.[edit]




Frank Khulusi - CEO and founder of PCM Inc.


The company now known as PCM was founded by two brothers, Sam and Frank Khulusi, in 1987 under the name of “Creative Computers”. Creative Computers was launched from the founders’ residence in Marina Del Rey, CA. The company was set up as a mail order catalog company whereby products are advertised through paper flyers/catalogs. Interested customers called in their orders through the provided toll-free "1-800" phone number.[2] The founders then took the order and placed purchase orders to acquire sold products, bill the customers’ credit card and ship the products to the customers. At startup, the company’s catalog consisted of one brand of computers “Amiga” made by Commodore International. The company became the number one mail order reseller of Amiga computers. In 1993/1994 Commodore went through financial difficulties, which caused it to close its operation in April 1994.
In early 1994, PC Mall obtained authorization to sell Apple computers through its mail order catalog model. The authorization came at an opportune time as the Commodore operation was soon to close. With the Apple authorization and the anticipated growth, PC Mall moved its operation from the back of a retail store to a call center with over 100 seats, a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) distribution center, and over 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) of corporate office space.
In first quarter of 1995, the company filed for its initial public offering and went public in April 1995.
Growth and Acquisitions[edit]
In early 1995, the company expanded its catalog to include PC Wintel products as well. To support the growth, the company moved its distribution center to a 212,000-square-foot (19,700 m2) distribution center next to FedEx hub in Memphis, TN in the third quarter of 1995. In addition to the millions of catalogs mailed monthly, the company launched its first web sites macmall.com and pcmall.com in 1996.

In 2011, the company launched its website onSale.com, which focuses on daily deals and electronic products, via the Internet.
In third quarter of 2006, PC Mall Gov, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PC Mall, Inc., acquired the product business of GMRI, a Virginia-based company. GMRI provides IT consulting and technology solutions for Federal agencies.[5]

History[edit]
As Creative Computers Inc.[edit]




Frank Khulusi - CEO and founder of PCM Inc.


The company now known as PCM was founded by two brothers, Sam and Frank Khulusi, in 1987 under the name of “Creative Computers”. Creative Computers was launched from the founders’ residence in Marina Del Rey, CA. The company was set up as a mail order catalog company whereby products are advertised through paper flyers/catalogs. Interested customers called in their orders through the provided toll-free "1-800" phone number.[2] The founders then took the order and placed purchase orders to acquire sold products, bill the customers’ credit card and ship the products to the customers. At startup, the company’s catalog consisted of one brand of computers “Amiga” made by Commodore International. The company became the number one mail order reseller of Amiga computers. In 1993/1994 Commodore went through financial difficulties, which caused it to close its operation in April 1994.
In early 1994, PC Mall obtained authorization to sell Apple computers through its mail order catalog model. The authorization came at an opportune time as the Commodore operation was soon to close. With the Apple authorization and the anticipated growth, PC Mall moved its operation from the back of a retail store to a call center with over 100 seats, a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) distribution center, and over 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) of corporate office space.
In first quarter of 1995, the company filed for its initial public offering and went public in April 1995.
Growth and Acquisitions[edit]
In early 1995, the company expanded its catalog to include PC Wintel products as well. To support the growth, the company moved its distribution center to a 212,000-square-foot (19,700 m2) distribution center next to FedEx hub in Memphis, TN in the third quarter of 1995. In addition to the millions of catalogs mailed monthly, the company launched its first web sites macmall.com and pcmall.com in 1996.
In 1996/1997, the company acquired Computability, a Milwaukee-based company,[3] and Elek-Tek, a Chicago-based company, both dealing primarily with PC Wintel products.
In 2001, the company acquired Wareforce, a southern California-based company. Then, in 2002, the company acquired Club Mac, another southern California-based operation.[4]
In 2011, the company launched its website onSale.com, which focuses on daily deals and electronic products, via the Internet.
In third quarter of 2006, PC Mall Gov, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PC Mall, Inc., acquired the product business of GMRI, a Virginia-based company. GMRI provides IT consulting and technology solutions for Federal agencies.[5]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

In today's complex world of investment opportunity, even the most knowledgeable investor can find it challenging to develop and maintain a prudent financial plan. We believe successful investing comes at the intersection where your unique needs are met with the expertise of a team you trust to deliver a customized solution that is highly focused and tailored for your situation. Because change is constant in the financial markets, it continually impacts the suitability of an investment. As changes occur in the markets and in your life, we are here to help ensure that they are reflected in your investment portfolio. When you have questions or ideas to explore, we are here to listen and respond. As a local investment management firm, you have our commitment that you will experience the personal attention and exceptional service that you deserve. Let our team of experienced investment professionals design a financial plan and implement an investment strategy to help you achieve your goals.

Investment Management

After taking the time to understand your unique situation, including risk tolerance, investment experience and goals, we will help you construct a diversified asset allocation tailored for you. This is the first step in constructing a portfolio with the right balance of risk and return characteristics to meet your needs. Once we’ve helped you establish a long-term asset allocation, we will manage the investments within that allocation on a discretionary basis using our proprietary quantitative investment process. We use our quantitative research to find investments that offer the right balance of both risk and return to meet the diversification needs of your portfolio and to help keep you on track. We do not try to time the markets, however we strongly believe in the benefits of portfolio rebalancing and we keep an eye toward tax efficiency. We also believe in trying to minimize expenses, which is why we use many institutional investments for our clients. In addition, Private Capital Management has access to some investment strategies that are closed to new investors. Please click here to read more about our proprietary quantitative investment research process.


Financial Planning

Private Capital Management offers complimentary financial planning to our clients who have questions about their financial situation. Whether that is understanding if you have enough to pay for college tuition, when to retire or how much you need to maintain your lifestyle in retirement, we’re here to help answer these important questions through our financial planning process. If you are considering a large purchase or the sale of your business, we can help you better understand the financial impact of these significant decisions. We offer comprehensive planning that is customized to your situation yet flexible enough to evaluate a broad range of scenarios.

Nickel-metal-hydride batteries pack a significant electrical punch in a compact, lightweight package. NiMh batteries have a wide operating temperature range and typically have a cycle life of about 3000 cycles. Also, they can tolerate over charge and over discharge conditions, simplifying maintenance requirements. Another advantage to NiMh batteries is that they are environmentally friendly because they are made without Cadmium, Mercury or Lead.
Some applications that NiMh batteries can be used for are mobile phones and smartphones, laptops and tablets, digital cameras and camcorders, electronic cigarettes, handheld game consoles and flashlights.  NiMH (Nickel-Metal Hydride) batteries are a rechargeable alternative to lithium or alkaline batteries. NiMH batteries usually have 2-3 times the capacity of an equivalent sized nickel-cadmium battery. NiMH batteries are used in conjunction with a smart charger, and can be recharged and reused hundreds or even thousands of times, saving you money! 
BatteryJunction.com has some of the top name brands of NiMH batteries, including Panasonic Eneloop Low Self Discharge batteries, Energizer, and Tenergy, as well as our lower cost house brand, Titanium Innovations. NiMH batteries come in all the standard sizes including AA, AAA, C, D, and 9V, as well as some specialty sizes including A, 2/3A, 4/3A, and more.

The nickel-cadmium or NiCd battery is a rechargeable battery that uses a nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes. NiCd batteries are fast to charge and can take a high number of charges if properly taken care of and not misused.Ni-Cd cells are available in the same sizes as alkaline batteries, from AAA through D, as well as several multi-cell sizes, including the equivalent of a 9 volt battery. They can be used in RC airplanes, boats, and cars, as well as cordless power tools, photographic equipment, flashlights, and toys.
NiCd batteries retain their charge better than alkaline or NiMH batteries do.  This consistent voltage is desirable for many users because there is no loss in performance when the batteries reach the end of their charge cycle. NiCd batteries last longer due to their low discharge rate, and have a longer storage life. NiCd batteries can be charged using most NiCd or NiMH battery chargers.
