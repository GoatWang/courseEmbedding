"As we move into the second half of the year, we look forward to building on the successes of the first six months and to staying the course with service, responsiveness and attention to detail."The Bank of South Carolina has branches in downtown Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Summerville and West Ashley. It has announced plans to open a full-service office off Highway 78 in North Charleston.Shares of the parent company are down about 10 percent since the start of the year.

ACH Origination

       Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions are electronic debits and credits used to efficiently disburse employee payroll through direct deposit or electronically collect receipts through direct payment from any bank account in the United States. Upon approval, by your relationship officer, business customers can set up recurring ACH transactions allowing files to be sent every week or month with little or no effort on your part. The Bank of South Carolina ACH Origination is the most cost effective and timely way to move money.
    


Direct Deposit


Direct Payment 



 Direct Deposit
    

       Government payments, payroll or pension checks are examples of transactions credited directly to the bank and deposited to customer�s accounts per an established schedule. Take advantage of Direct Deposit service and enjoy the benefits of never having to deposit a paycheck again!
    

       How It Works:
    


        You obtain written authorization from employees to make electronic payments to their accounts.
      

        You prepare and deliver payroll file to BKSC two days prior to settlement date.
      

        ACH files are transmitted into the ACH network, with employee�s accounts credited and your company's account debited on settlement day.
      

        All data submitted must be in conjunction with NACHA Rules and Regulations.
      


 Direct Payment
    

       Ideal for electronically collecting recurring receipts such as payments, memberships, dues, regular charitable contributions and periodic subscription fees. In either case, the transfer process is automated, convenient and predictable, giving you better control of your funds at less cost to your company.
    

       How It Works:
    


        You obtain written authorization from payers to draw regular electronic payments from their accounts.
      

        You prepare and deliver collection data to Bank of South Carolina one or two days prior to settlement date.
      

        ACH files are routed into the ACH network, with payers' accounts debited and your company's account credited on settlement day.
      

        All data submitted must be in conjunction with NACHA Rules and Regulations.
      


       Benefits to Your Company:
    


        Lower Costs: You save money by eliminating much of the manual work associated with your payment and collection processes. This includes less check printing and processing, lower postal expenses and fewer losses due to stolen, forged or lost checks.
      

        Improved Cash Flow: Quicker collection of payments means enhanced liquidity.
      

        Simplified Forecasting: You know the exact date of your funds transfers, simplifying daily funding decisions.
      

        Enhanced Benefits and Customer Service: ACH services benefit your employees/customers/vendors by eliminating manual work for them and lessening concern over timely payments.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

The Bank of South Carolina is a state-chartered financial institution with depository accounts insured by the FDIC. The Bank was organized on October 23, 1986, and our first office opened for business on February 26, 1987. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of South Carolina Corporation which became effective on April 17, 1995.
The Bank was organized with a commitment to creating a bank and banking philosophy based on personal service, lasting customer relationships, responsiveness and attention to detail in order to serve the Berkeley, Dorchester and Charleston communities as an independent community bank concentrating on individuals and small and medium sized businesses desiring a high level of service. In 1993, the Bank saw an opportunity to develop a community banking office in Summerville by staffing it with local people. In 1994, the Bank recognized a need to establish a Mortgage Origination Department to better serve its customers' needs. In May of 1996, another opportunity presented itself and The Bank of South Carolina opened a Mt. Pleasant banking office, again staffing it with local people. A fourth office was opened in March of 1998 to serve the needs of the West Ashley community.
As The Bank of South Carolina grows, it will continue to assess the needs of its community for future services and locations.

Bank Of South Carolina Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying And 3.09% Yield (BKSC)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

256 Meeting StCharleston, SC 29401


        (843) 724-1500
    






To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.

To fully understand why I love my bank would take too long.  I have had my commercial account here for 20+ years when my little business needed a few bucks and I tried to use Bank of America who I had banked my entire life with.  B of A made it almost impossible and after tons of paperwork and time I was still waiting when a friend told me to go to Doug at The Bank of SC.  I called him, he asked how much, sent over a check, and then got the paperwork done the following week.  I have stayed with them forever but never would do my personal banking here because I thought having Bank of America for personal was more convenient.   That was until this past 2 weeks where I went twice to get paperwork notarized only to be told that for one reason or another they could not. Both times I calls The Bank of SC and was told come on in. I did and they notarized both times.  Both times with smiles and nothing but great personal professional service.  I will be organizing my bank info over the next month and hopefully moving it all to Bank of SC.  Big banks suck!  Especially BofA.
