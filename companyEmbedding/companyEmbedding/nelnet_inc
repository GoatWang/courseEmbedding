How to Make a Payment






How to Make a Payment
We Have Options for you to Make a Payment Anytime, Anywhere.






Payment Allocation
For more information on payment allocation, please visit Nelnet.com/how-payments-are-allocated








Auto Debit
Never miss a payment. When you sign up for auto debit, your payment is automatically deducted from the bank account of your choosing. Plus, you could even save on your interest rate* while your account is in an active repayment status!
*Your lender may modify or terminate its borrower benefit program at its discretion and without prior notice. Your failure to satisfy benefit eligibility requirements may result in the loss of the benefit.








Mobile App
Our mobile app is available in the iTunes Store and Google Play. Download it today and manage your account from your mobile device.








Online
Log in to your Nelnet.com account to get the latest information on your student loans. You can check due dates, make a payment, set up auto debit, explore repayment options, and set up authorized payers.








Via Mail
Mail your payment using the address located on your statement. Make sure that you include your Nelnet account number, including the “D, J, or E”, so that your payment is processed in a timely manner and correctly applied to your accounts.








Online Bill Pay
Use your bank's online bill pay service (make sure they don't charge a fee). You'll just need to give them the Payee (Nelnet), your account number, and the payment address, which is the P.O. box address on the bottom of your statement.
`







Via Phone
Call us at 888.486.4722 and make a payment through our automated phone system or with a Customer Service Representative.

Your Student Loan Servicer



Nelnet, Your Student Loan Servicer
Nelnet works with the Department of Education (Department) to help you achieve your educational goals. We provide customer service on your federal student loans, so we answer your questions, offer solutions if you're having trouble paying, and process your payments.
You'll typically go through three stages during your loan's life cycle—in school, in grace, and in repayment—and will receive a variety of communication from us depending on the stage your loan is currently in.
We want you to have the best borrower experience possible. Let us know how we can help you.
Nelnet is Your Student Loan Servicer
It is possible that Nelnet owns your loan, but we also provide customer service for other lenders' loans, including those from the Department. Nelnet provides customer service on your account if:

You borrowed money directly from Nelnet
You have taken out a Federal Direct Loan from the Department and Nelnet was selected to service the loan
Your lender sold your loan to the Department and Nelnet was selected to service the loan
Your lender sold your loan to Nelnet and Nelnet now owns and services the loan
Your lender selected Nelnet to service the loan

Servicer(s) of Your Federal Student Loans
Your federal student loans may or may not all be with Nelnet or another servicer. It's important that you know which servicer(s) provides customer service for each of your student loans—and it's simple to verify. You can access all of your federal student loan data at nslds.ed.gov. You will need your FSA ID. To create or update your FSA ID, visit FSAID.ed.gov.
Difference Between the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and the Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP)
A Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP) loan is originally borrowed from or currently owned by the Department of Education. A Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loan was originally borrowed from a company such as a bank, lender, or non-profit organization and could be currently owned by the Department of Education, a bank, lender, or non-profit organization. The FFEL Program ended in June 2010. All federal student loans borrowed after June 2010 are FDLP loans.
You May Have More Than One Servicer: How to Find Out
If you have loans with more than one servicer, you will need to make a payment to each. If you're not sure which servicers have your loans, log on to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) website at nslds.ed.gov, or call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 800.433.3243.
  
It's your responsibility to be aware of the number of student loans that have been taken out in your name, the amount owed, the timing of repayment, and where to send payments. If you make two or more monthly student loan payments, it may be wise to consider consolidating them into one loan.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Controversies[edit]
In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae.
The New York Times reported in August 2007 that Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, allowed Nelnet to be forgiven the $1 million settlement the company reached with Bruning in April 2007.[7][8] Nelnet was accused of industry wide kickbacks, improper inducements, and gifts from student loan providers to colleges and universities. Nelnet agreed to provide $1 million to the state in support of a national financial aid awareness campaign. Bruning decided in August 2007 to forgive Nelnet its $1 million obligation after the company announced that it had reached a separate $2 million settlement with New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.[8]
Nelnet has also made significant financial contributions to United States congressional campaigns, including a contribution from Nelnet and Union Bank & Trust Company of $16,100 to Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, for his Senate election campaign.[9] Nelnet spent approximately $200,000.00 in the 2015-2016 Election Cycle, per Federal Election Commission Records and have already spent an approximate $60,000 for the 2017-2018 Election Cycle.[10]
A United States Department of Education audit revealed that from 1993 to 2007, Nelnet had utilized a loophole in federal tax legislation that allowed the company to receive a higher interest rate on specified loans, generating $278 million from taxpayers.[11] Nelnet disputed the findings of the audit through a letter written to the United States Department of Education letting them know of this loophole, and ultimately, U.S. Department of Education ruled that Nelnet would keep the $278 million.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2010, that Nelnet settled a case for $55 million. The suit was filed by a former Department of Education researcher named Dr. Jon Oberg. Nelnet and other lenders were accused of defrauding taxpayers of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies. The largest student lender in the country, Sallie Mae, is also listed as a defendant in the case.
Charitable giving[edit]
Some of the organizations that Nelnet gives time and/or money to include Teammates, the Learn to Dream Scholarship, United Way of America, and Junior Achievement.
The Nelnet Foundation was formed in 2004. Since its inception, it has awarded more than $10 million in charitable funds to regional and national charities.[12]

Controversies[edit]
In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae.
The New York Times reported in August 2007 that Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, allowed Nelnet to be forgiven the $1 million settlement the company reached with Bruning in April 2007.[7][8] Nelnet was accused of industry wide kickbacks, improper inducements, and gifts from student loan providers to colleges and universities. Nelnet agreed to provide $1 million to the state in support of a national financial aid awareness campaign. Bruning decided in August 2007 to forgive Nelnet its $1 million obligation after the company announced that it had reached a separate $2 million settlement with New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.[8]
Nelnet has also made significant financial contributions to United States congressional campaigns, including a contribution from Nelnet and Union Bank & Trust Company of $16,100 to Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, for his Senate election campaign.[9] Nelnet spent approximately $200,000.00 in the 2015-2016 Election Cycle, per Federal Election Commission Records and have already spent an approximate $60,000 for the 2017-2018 Election Cycle.[10]
A United States Department of Education audit revealed that from 1993 to 2007, Nelnet had utilized a loophole in federal tax legislation that allowed the company to receive a higher interest rate on specified loans, generating $278 million from taxpayers.[11] Nelnet disputed the findings of the audit through a letter written to the United States Department of Education letting them know of this loophole, and ultimately, U.S. Department of Education ruled that Nelnet would keep the $278 million.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2010, that Nelnet settled a case for $55 million. The suit was filed by a former Department of Education researcher named Dr. Jon Oberg. Nelnet and other lenders were accused of defrauding taxpayers of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies. The largest student lender in the country, Sallie Mae, is also listed as a defendant in the case.
Charitable giving[edit]
Some of the organizations that Nelnet gives time and/or money to include Teammates, the Learn to Dream Scholarship, United Way of America, and Junior Achievement.
The Nelnet Foundation was formed in 2004. Since its inception, it has awarded more than $10 million in charitable funds to regional and national charities.[12]

About Nelnet
Why We Do What We Do: A Message from Mike Dunlap, Chairman of the Board

Personally I find that if I strive every day to fulfill a larger purpose—whether it is helping my kids, assisting associates and customers to reach their goals, or working toward serving a higher purpose—I find the most satisfaction. Our overall mission, to make educational dreams possible, falls into this category for me.
By helping people accomplish their educational goals instead of focusing on ourselves, we collectively have a huge impact on the quality of their lives, making the world a place where fulfilling dreams is possible. As we help families set up payment plans to better afford an education, support families' efforts to successfully plan for college, explain options to make it easier to pay back student loans, and simply answer questions, every interaction we have with customers impacts their educational experience, and I am proud to be a part of it.
I want to publicly thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers. It is making the world a much better place.
Who We Are and What We Do
With a #1 core value of focusing on the customer, we provide innovative educational services in loan servicing, payment processing, education planning, and asset management. These products and services help students and families plan, prepare, and pay for their education while making the administrative and financial processes more efficient for schools and financial organizations.
Headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska, with other offices around the United States and Canada, we employ more than 2,250 associates who serve customers throughout the education life cycle.

At Nelnet, we’re more than just a student loan servicer. We have products and subsidiaries that work with customers to help them achieve their educational dreams through every part of their education lifecycle- from pre-K through college.

Nelnet, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Capital Expenditures Guidance for the Full Year 2017
May 8 17
Nelnet, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The company reported GAAP net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc. was $50.0 million, or $1.18 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared with GAAP net income of $48.0 million, or $1.11 per share, for the same period a year ago.

The increase in GAAP net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared with the same period in 2016, was due to smaller losses recognized in 2017, as compared to 2016, related to changes in fair values of derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP, and foreign currency transaction adjustments caused by the re-measurement of the company's Euro-denominated bonds to U.S. dollars. In addition, during the first quarter of 2017, the company recognized a $5.0 million, or $0.07 per share after tax, gain from the repurchase of its own debt. For the first quarter of 2017, the company reported net interest income of $76.9 million, compared with $101.6 million for the same period a year ago.

For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the company generated $73.8 million in net cash from operating activities. The company incurred capital expenditures of $16.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The company currently anticipates total network expenditures of approximately $80 million for 2017, however, the amount of capital expenditures could change based on customer demand for ALLO's services.

Controversies[edit]
In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae.
The New York Times reported in August 2007 that Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, allowed Nelnet to be forgiven the $1 million settlement the company reached with Bruning in April 2007.[7][8] Nelnet was accused of industry wide kickbacks, improper inducements, and gifts from student loan providers to colleges and universities. Nelnet agreed to provide $1 million to the state in support of a national financial aid awareness campaign. Bruning decided in August 2007 to forgive Nelnet its $1 million obligation after the company announced that it had reached a separate $2 million settlement with New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.[8]
Nelnet has also made significant financial contributions to United States congressional campaigns, including a contribution from Nelnet and Union Bank & Trust Company of $16,100 to Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, for his Senate election campaign.[9] Nelnet spent approximately $200,000.00 in the 2015-2016 Election Cycle, per Federal Election Commission Records and have already spent an approximate $60,000 for the 2017-2018 Election Cycle.[10]
A United States Department of Education audit revealed that from 1993 to 2007, Nelnet had utilized a loophole in federal tax legislation that allowed the company to receive a higher interest rate on specified loans, generating $278 million from taxpayers.[11] Nelnet disputed the findings of the audit through a letter written to the United States Department of Education letting them know of this loophole, and ultimately, U.S. Department of Education ruled that Nelnet would keep the $278 million.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2010, that Nelnet settled a case for $55 million. The suit was filed by a former Department of Education researcher named Dr. Jon Oberg. Nelnet and other lenders were accused of defrauding taxpayers of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies. The largest student lender in the country, Sallie Mae, is also listed as a defendant in the case.
Charitable giving[edit]
Some of the organizations that Nelnet gives time and/or money to include Teammates, the Learn to Dream Scholarship, United Way of America, and Junior Achievement.
The Nelnet Foundation was formed in 2004. Since its inception, it has awarded more than $10 million in charitable funds to regional and national charities.[12]

A United States Department of Education audit revealed that from 1993 to 2007, Nelnet had utilized a loophole in federal tax legislation that allowed the company to receive a higher interest rate on specified loans, generating $278 million from taxpayers.[11] Nelnet disputed the findings of the audit through a letter written to the United States Department of Education letting them know of this loophole, and ultimately, U.S. Department of Education ruled that Nelnet would keep the $278 million.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2010, that Nelnet settled a case for $55 million. The suit was filed by a former Department of Education researcher named Dr. Jon Oberg. Nelnet and other lenders were accused of defrauding taxpayers of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies. The largest student lender in the country, Sallie Mae, is also listed as a defendant in the case.
Charitable giving[edit]
Some of the organizations that Nelnet gives time and/or money to include Teammates, the Learn to Dream Scholarship, United Way of America, and Junior Achievement.
The Nelnet Foundation was formed in 2004. Since its inception, it has awarded more than $10 million in charitable funds to regional and national charities.[12]

Controversies[edit]
In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae.
The New York Times reported in August 2007 that Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, allowed Nelnet to be forgiven the $1 million settlement the company reached with Bruning in April 2007.[7][8] Nelnet was accused of industry wide kickbacks, improper inducements, and gifts from student loan providers to colleges and universities. Nelnet agreed to provide $1 million to the state in support of a national financial aid awareness campaign. Bruning decided in August 2007 to forgive Nelnet its $1 million obligation after the company announced that it had reached a separate $2 million settlement with New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.[8]
Nelnet has also made significant financial contributions to United States congressional campaigns, including a contribution from Nelnet and Union Bank & Trust Company of $16,100 to Jon Bruning, Nebraska Attorney General, for his Senate election campaign.[9] Nelnet spent approximately $200,000.00 in the 2015-2016 Election Cycle, per Federal Election Commission Records and have already spent an approximate $60,000 for the 2017-2018 Election Cycle.[10]
A United States Department of Education audit revealed that from 1993 to 2007, Nelnet had utilized a loophole in federal tax legislation that allowed the company to receive a higher interest rate on specified loans, generating $278 million from taxpayers.[11] Nelnet disputed the findings of the audit through a letter written to the United States Department of Education letting them know of this loophole, and ultimately, U.S. Department of Education ruled that Nelnet would keep the $278 million.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2010, that Nelnet settled a case for $55 million. The suit was filed by a former Department of Education researcher named Dr. Jon Oberg. Nelnet and other lenders were accused of defrauding taxpayers of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies. The largest student lender in the country, Sallie Mae, is also listed as a defendant in the case.
Charitable giving[edit]
Some of the organizations that Nelnet gives time and/or money to include Teammates, the Learn to Dream Scholarship, United Way of America, and Junior Achievement.
The Nelnet Foundation was formed in 2004. Since its inception, it has awarded more than $10 million in charitable funds to regional and national charities.[12]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
