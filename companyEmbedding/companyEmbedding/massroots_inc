Thank you!MassRoots' Corporate Overview (July 2017)View ReportExpanding Marijuana MarketsWe believe we have one of the best models to profit off of the growing trend of cannabis regulation. Because we are not involved in the production or sale of cannabis, we do not have to build grow facilities, open retail stores, or have a physical presence in the state in order to generate revenue. At the same time, our revenue model is not tied to the success of a particular location, brand or ballot initiative — we believe we will have a significant percentage of all dispensaries and brands on our application, making MassRoots a technology platform for the entire cannabis industry.Team | MassRootsMeet the MassRoots TeamWe're a group of highly motivated, talented professionals working to connect and empower the cannabis community.What We Stand ForWe believe that the legalization of cannabis will have profound economic, health and societal benefits in countries around the world;We believe that by connecting and empowering the cannabis community, MassRoots is uniquely positioned to accelerate pro-legalization reforms;We believe that by recruiting and retaining the best talent, MassRoots will develop the leading technology for consumers and businesses in the emerging cannabis industry.Isaac DietrichChief Executive OfficerLance GaleyChief Technology OfficerBob PullarChief Financial OfficerDan DrollerVP of Business DevelopmentBrian BuresonDirector of User ExperienceCristian WhitneySenior Product DesignerPatrick HansenSenior Product DesignerKathleen BurkhardtSenior Marketing ManagerJohn DavisDirector of TalentKevin ShiuanDirector of Product ManagementBen ShakerScrum MasterFergus MaherSenior Software EngineerSam OdomLead iOS EngineerValerie KraucunasSoftware EngineerSebastian VelaSenior Software EngineerTeagan GlennSenior Software EngineerMicah DavidsonSenior Software ArchitectHayley ThomasExecutive Assistant / Office ManagerLindsey PauletteUser SupportChristina ForkerUser Support ManagerAustin LoganLead VideoDustin CarterAccount ExecutiveJohn DillContent StrategistJeff ChamblissFinance InternMarvin GlennChief Doggy OfficerGoncalo MargalhoSoftware EngineerDarrell PinerSenior Software EngineerZac ZagerSenior Software EngineerTom AngellSenior Political CorrespondentSohum ShahDirector of Investor RelationsContact Us | MassRootsContact UsSend Us a MessageSendThank you!

Through both cannabis related and unrelated pictures, videos and text, our like-minded users are brought together from all over the world, one post at a time. Some network guidelines have been put in place to ensure a harmonious experience for all. These guidelines fall under two categories; compliance with the law and respect for your fellow MassRoots’ users. They outline the expectations for community members as well as provide the steps to reporting any behavior which does not honor said guidelines.MassRoots, in its sole discretion, may remove any status or comment from the network at any given time. Any and all content which violates these guidelines may be taken down without warning and could result in the removal of the account which said content was posted from.Compliance with the LawsUsers must follow the law that pertains to the current state or province which they reside in. Due to MassRoots’ close association with cannabis, users must live in a Medical Marijuana Approved State and must be at least 18 years of age to join. Buying, selling or trading cannabis or cannabis infused products without the proper licensing is illegal and is not supported or tolerated by MassRoots. Posting statuses, images, videos or comments depicting or referencing illegal drugs or prostitution, is considered restricted content and warrants immediate removal from the network.Respect Your MassFamMassRoots aims to foster a positive and diverse community. Encouraging violence, threatening others or posting content which targets individuals with intent to shame or degrade them is strictly prohibited. Any and all reported content is investigated by MassRoots’ support team. MassRoots will attempt to take all sides of a disagreement into consideration before coming to a conclusion wherever possible. The decision is to be made by the support team alone and all decisions are final. In order to avoid a negative experience users must all follow a few simple rules:A. Be Welcoming and TolerantMassRoots supports people of all backgrounds & identities. No user should feel excluded due to their race, ethnicity, culture, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, education level, mental capacity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, political belief, religion or physical ability.B. If You Have Nothing Nice to Say, Say Nothing at AllWhen dealing with conflict which has no clear solution, please refrain from engaging. Move past the dispute by either blocking the user, or, if they are breaking MassRoots’ Community Guidelines, reporting the user to our support team. You can do this by emailing support@massroots.com.C. Only Post Content Which You Have the Right to ShareRemember that content posted to your profile must be authentic. It may not contain images you have accumulated from the internet. Users own their content through intellectual property rights; the exclusive rights given to an individual over the creations of their minds, and therefore reposting others as your own is against our policy.D. Post Appropriate ContentAlthough this community is a 420-friendly one, not every post must be about cannabis. Do not talk down to those simply sharing their day to day experiences and opinions. Nudity, pornography, prescription drugs, weapons promoting violence, gruesome or graphic images, and harsh or offensive language are not appropriate content to post to the network.E. Impersonating a User or Creating a FakeProfile is Strictly Prohibited.We take this very seriously. If someone is pretending to be you, simply upload an image of your ID and send it tosupport@massroots.com along with your username and the username of the impersonator. The user will be removed and banned from the network.F. Spammers, No Spamming!Spamming, sending the same or similarly worded message indiscriminately to a large number of recipients for marketing purposes, is strictly prohibited on the MassRoots network. To report spam see directions below.Help us Keep the Community Strong (Reporting Violations)Keeping restricted content off MassRoots is pertinent to sustaining a healthy community. MassRoots’ support team reviews reported content and works diligently to remove anything illegal, discriminatory, harmful or offensive daily. If you witness a fellow user failing to follow MassRoots’ Community Guidelines, it is your duty, as a community member, to bring it to the attention of the Support Team. In the event that you come across a post which does not interest you, however does not violate our guidelines, you have the option to unfollow or block the user posting said content. (To block users, see directions below)Here's How:To Report a Post...Go to the user’s post and click the “...” underneath the post you would like to report and then click “Report Post”To Block a User...Visit the profile of the user you would like to block.

(Screenshots are helpful here)Diversity StatementMassRoots encourages everyone, whom is of age, currently residing in a Medical Marijuana Approved State, to join our network. Every user is entitled to the same rights. If any of our community members have been insulted, offended, or harassed, MassRoots’ Support Team will take into consideration both sides of the conflict before coming to a conclusion which will better the community as a whole.We honor diversity in all ethnicities, race, socioeconomic status, gender, exceptionalities, language, religion, sexual orientation, technical ability, profession, identity or expression of, culture, national origin, age, profession and political beliefs.These guidelines are by no means all-inclusive.

DENVER, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MassRoots, Inc. (OTCQB:MSRT), one of the leading technology and compliance platforms for the cannabis industry, is pleased to announce it has closed a $1,217,000 private placement of common stock and warrants, as detailed in MassRoots' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 24, 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MassRoots' Chairman and only over 5% shareholder, Mr. Isaac Dietrich, participated in the offering along with several "accredited investors," including family offices and high net worth individuals.








In July 2017, MassRoots acquired Odava, a leading point-of-sale and regulatory compliance platform for cannabis dispensaries. Odava's main integration to state regulators is through Franwell, Inc.'s METRC system, which was recently awarded the contract for California's cannabis regulatory reporting system. MassRoots expects this will enable Odava to enter the California market with minimal infrastructure changes. With more than 1,000 dispensaries expected to be subject to California state regulations for the first time, this presents a unique growth opportunity for MassRoots to on-board these dispensaries to the Odava system as well as its other product offerings.
"California is the largest regulated cannabis market in the country and while our platform is available in other states, our main priority is aggressively scaling our market share in the Golden State," stated MassRoots' Chief Executive Officer Mr. Isaac Dietrich. "The proceeds from this offering will help us take advantage of the opportunity created by our recent acquisition of Odava and the California regulatory contract being awarded to Franwell."
For more information, please see MassRoots' recent Corporate Overview Deck, Shareholder Update, and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
About MassRootsMassRoots, Inc. is one of the leading technology platforms for the regulated cannabis industry. Powered by more than one million registered users, the Company's mobile apps empower consumers to make educated cannabis purchasing decisions through community-driven reviews. Its compliance and point-of-sale system, Odava, enables cannabis-related businesses to streamline their retail operations and compliance reporting to state regulators. With a significant market share of medical cannabis patients in certain markets, more than 25,000 shareholders, equity financings and warrant exercises of more than $17 million since inception, the Company believes it is uniquely positioned to best serve the needs of the cannabis industry. For more information, please visit MassRoots.com/Investors and MassRoots, Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

MassRoots Partners with Headset to Expand Business Analytics and Standardize Cannabis Product Data
DENVER, Sept. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — MassRoots, Inc. (OTCQB: MSRT) and Headset, Inc., a leading business intelligence platform for cannabis-related businesses, are pleased to announce a strategic partnership to expand the functionality and utility of the MassRoots and Headset platforms. Under the terms of their partnership, Headset’s base-level intelligence dashboard and menu management software will be integrated with MassRoots for Business. Additionally, Headset’s standardized database of products and strains will serve as a foundation for MassRoots’ product review system scheduled for release in October 2016.
“This partnership will greatly expand MassRoots’ offerings to businesses while accelerating the development of product reviews and live menu pricing,” stated MassRoots COO Dan Hunt. “Over the past six years, Cy Scott and the Headset team have shaped the development of the regulated cannabis industry and have gained more insights into the space than nearly anyone else. We could not be more excited to partner with Headset to power the next generation of cannabis technology.”
At Headset, we look forward to providing additional value to the MassRoots for Businesses offering through our technology and services. We are excited to be working with MassRoots, a company that has built the largest social network of passionate cannabis consumers.
Cy Scott, Headset Co-founder and CEO
We have always admired their bold actions and outspoken support of the cannabis industry when confronted with external challenges and their willingness to take strong positions and galvanize the industry in alignment with common causes.
In 2010, Cy Scott, Brian Wansolich, and Scott Vickers founded Leafly.com and helped build it into one of the world’s largest cannabis information websites, successfully exiting to Privateer Holdings in 2011. Recognizing the need for greater business intelligence in the cannabis industry, the Leafly founders started Headset in 2015 to provide businesses with actionable data to enhance their bottom line. For more information, please visit Headset.io.

In May 2015, MassRoots invested in Flowhub's preferred seed round to provide capital for the initial development of the platform. "There are strong synergies between Flowhub and MassRoots. We are creating a closed-loop system to streamline the most important functions for cannabis businesses and consumers," stated MassRoots CEO Isaac Dietrich. "We believe Flowhub is at a critical inflection point, poised to scale from dozens of dispensary locations using its platform now to hundreds of locations by the end of the year. Within the next few months, we believe a significant percentage of all transactions occurring in the regulated cannabis industry will occur on the MassRoots/Flowhub platform." "We're not just creating a tool to solve a specific pain-point for businesses; we're engineering the technology platform that could power the entire cannabis industry," stated Flowhub CEO Kyle Sherman. "We've made the transition from the existing legacy systems to Flowhub simple and hassle-free – in some cases taking less than a day. Contact us today for a demo and our software will speak for itself."  About MassRoots MassRoots is one of the largest and most active technology platforms for cannabis consumers, businesses and activists with over 900,000 registered users.

MassRoots Q2 Earnings Call and Transcript  Good afternoon, thank you all for joining MassRoots’ second quarter earnings call. My name is Isaac Dietrich, and I currently serve as MassRoots’ Chief Executive Officer. Before we begin, we’d like to state that this call does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities or assets of MassRoots, Inc. This presentation includes certain statements, estimates and projections provided by MassRoots with respect to anticipated future performance. Such statements, estimates and projections constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, which may cause actual results to be materially different from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. The recipient of this information is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. No representations or warranties are made as to the accuracy of such forward looking statements or whether any of the projections included herein will be realized. MassRoots does not expect to update or otherwise revise this presentation. I’ve prepared some brief remarks covering MassRoots’ revenue growth, Business Model, user growth and Product Development; but the majority of this call will be spent answering questions from you, our shareholders. Questions may be submitted via email to IR@MassRoots.com. Now on to the call. I’m pleased to report MassRoots generated $492,000 in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, more than all previous quarters in our corporate history combined. This took our cumulative year-to-date revenue to $585,000, of which approximately $325,000 was generated from our core product of digital advertising. As a digital product, MassRoots is able to scale rapidly with minimal additional cost – the only marginal expense associated with gaining additional users is an increase in server activity. For MassRoots’ main revenue generators, digital advertising and a dispensary locator, the only marginal cost is the credit card processing fee. We believe that as its model continues to mature, we will be able to generate significant revenue with negligible cost of goods sold. We believe that MassRoots can reach cash-flow positive from its current user base and web traffic. The problem over the past year hasn’t been users– MassRoots sees more eyeballs than many other cannabis websites and apps – the problem has been our products have lacked the core functionality to connect users with the dispensaries and products for which they are looking. We believe that our dispensary finder is a solid first step in fixing this deficiency. With the core functionality now in place, we aim to rapidly iterate and expand on its functionality to include menus with live pricing, product pages with reviews, and top search result placement for paid advertisers. We believe that each of these features will create new revenue streams for our business – Weedmaps reportedly generated over $20 million in revenue in 2015 off of such features. Revamped MassRoots for Business Portal We originally introduced MassRoots for Business in early 2015 as an online portal for businesses to schedule posts and view analytics; while useful for businesses, it did not have the features or capacity to scale to millions of dollars in revenue. When fully developed, the revamped MassRoots for Business portal will consolidate many online marketing functions for cannabis-related business in one central platform. We expect businesses will be able to schedule posts on MassRoots, Facebook and Twitter, purchase advertising on both MassRoots owned-properties as well as third party digital properties, and view actionable, real-time data from MassRoots and third party sources in easy-to-read formats. We believe this will serve as a solid foundation for future business-related features as we prepare to integrate dispensary point-of-sale data later this year. As of June 30, 2016, we had total currently assets of $147,000 and total current liabilities of $1.7 million – which is not a great balance sheet. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we have closed $1.6 million in a registered offering at $0.50/share with $0.90 warrants, which puts us within striking distance of being able to fully repay our debts and rebuild our assets. Expense Reductions During the six months ending June 30, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $4,701,000. That is a lot of money. Now $293,956 of that was for common stock issued for services and $1,330,984 was for options issued for services, which slightly dilutes the company’s shares, but doesn’t take cash of the business. So let’s look at the remaining $3,076,000 – there’s about $250,000 in one-time investment banking fees, there’s $293,000 in cost of goods sold primarily for the one-time event the 420 rally, there’s about $557,000 in advertising that we can significantly reduce because we’ve built a great brand that can grow organically, so there’s about $1,976,000 in other expenses, or about $329,000 per month. During July 2016, the Company eliminated $54,000 in monthly expenses by terminating relationships with certain vendors, reducing headcount from 33 to 24 full-time employees, and utilizing new technological tools to achieve better results with fewer resources. As many of these contracts and agreements had 30, 60 or 90-day termination clauses, we expect these expense reductions not to be fully reflected until the fourth quarter of 2016. Reductions in staff were concentrated on the content, account services, and sales teams, while the team focused on our core product – development – remains fully intact. Even as MassRoots continues to scale its user base and revenues, we do not expect a significant increase in the size of our team as we plan to automate as many processes as possible in a self-service platform for our clients. Like other leaders in the technology field, our plan is to scale through automation and technology, not by increasing our staff and overhead. We believe these expense reductions could result in significant savings for the Company, currently estimated to be approximately $648,000 annually. MassRoots’ management will continue to review for unnecessary expenses on a weekly basis and believe the Company can reach cash-flow positive on a monthly basis by the end of 2016. The Team MassRoots has 24 full-time employees working out of headquarters in downtown Denver, Colorado. The majority of these employees are engineers and designers focused on developing new features for the MassRoots platform. We believe that over the long run, a small, talented and close knit team of A will outperform larger teams of B and C. We believe we have found talented individuals at every level – sales representatives who outperform expectations, managers who make architectural decisions that will prevent costly and time-consuming blunders, and engineers developing new features that have the potential to provide significant long term returns. One of MassRoots’ top priorities in 2016 has been recruiting and retaining some of the top talent in the cannabis and technology industries. In June 2016, we hired Lance Galey as MassRoots’ Chief Technology Officer. Previously, Mr. Galey served as Chief Software Architect of Cloud Services for Autodesk and Vice President and Principle Architect at Salesforce, where he led the architecture and development of numerous core infrastructure and platform services underlying a large portfolio of Salesforce SaaS applications. In 2013, he was selected as the executive MVP for the technology division of Salesforce.com. State and National Brand Business Model While MassRoots’ consumer-facing network launched in July 2013, we did not start generating advertising revenue until we crossed a half million users in mid-August 2015. Our clients have primarily been ancillary businesses marketing their products to cannabis consumers through endorsed posts on MassRoots, sponsored content on our blog, and mentions in our email newsletter. It is not necessary for a user to join MassRoots in order for us to generate revenue from them – we are finding that many people will visit our website, join our email newsletter, or view a dispensary’s profile without registering for our MassRoots network. During the second quarter of 2016, we signed advertising contracts with a total value of $259,450 with 32 of the leading cannabis brands in the industry. As many of these contracts were for 3, 6 or 12-month campaigns, only a portion of the value was realized during the second quarter of 2016, and the rest will be realized over the coming quarters, building a solid foundation on which we can expand. While the vast majority of MassRoots’ advertising revenue to date has come from brands within the cannabis industry, we have started to see significant interest from mainstream brands and advertising agencies looking to market to cannabis consumers. Uber and Fusion, a division of Univision, became the first mainstream brands to advertise with MassRoots and have opened the doors for other major brands to evaluate the space. We believe that as the regulated cannabis market continues to expand, mainstream brands and advertising agencies will begin to allocate portions of multi-million advertising budgets towards outreach to the millions of cannabis consumers in the United States – especially food, lighter and agricultural brands. We are positioning MassRoots to be one of the first companies to receive these budget allocations. Local Store Business Model Up until the beta launch of our dispensary finder in August 2016, we didn’t really have a product for local dispensaries or stores, limiting our market. We now have over 175 dispensary locations paying for a basic listing. With the core functionality now in place, we aim to rapidly iterate and expand on its functionality to include menus with live pricing, product pages with reviews, and top search result placement for paid advertisers. We believe that each of these features will create new revenue streams for our business – with Weedmaps reportedly generating over $20 million in revenue last year off of them. 2016 Elections MassRoots believes the 2016 elections have the potential to significantly increase the size and scope of the regulated cannabis industry. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, campaigns in Maine, Nevada, Arizona, California, Michigan, Florida, and Massachusetts are expected to succeed in placing initiatives on their states’ ballots for this year’s election. Historically-speaking, the demographic make-up of the electorate during presidential election years tends to be younger and more diverse than in off-year elections, groups that are generally more supportive of the legalization of cannabis. We believe a number of the state initiatives on this year’s ballot stand a significant chance of becoming law. A 2016 ArcView Market Research Report projects the regulated cannabis industry could grow to $10 billion by 2018 as a result of this year’s elections. Our business model is designed to benefit from this trend. When a new state passes a medical or recreational cannabis law, we are able to start registering users and businesses in that state with minimal marginal cost. Because MassRoots is not involved in the production or sale of cannabis, we do not have to build outgrow operations, open retail stores, or have a significant physical presence in the state in order to generate revenue. At the same time, MassRoots’ financial model is not tied to the success of a particular location or brand – we believe we will have a significant percentage of all dispensaries and brands on our platform, making MassRoots a play on the industry as a whole. Sitting at the intersection of healthcare on the medical cannabis side and a vice industry on the recreational cannabis side, we believe the cannabis industry can continue to grow in any economic climate.        RECENT PRESS Denver Post // MassRoots hires former SalesForce VP as CTO Forbes // Nasdaq Denies MassRoots' Stock Listing Application  Fortune // The Nasdaq Has Once Again Denied a Bid for its First Marijuana Stock Financial Times // Pot Startup MassRoots' Nasdaq Plans Up in Smoke CBS News // Nasdaq Harshes a Marijuana Startup's Mellow CNN Money // Nasdaq Rejects Pot Startup MassRoots PBS Newshour // "Facebook for Pot" Applies to be Nasdaq's first Marijuana Stock Fortune // This Cannabis Social Network is Planning an IPO Again Forbes // MassRoots Files to Be Nasdaq's First Cannabis Stock Bloomberg // Pot Tech Companies Are Sneaking into CES The Guardian // Marijuana Social Network MassRoots Enjoys Natural High of Success CNBC // An App with "High" Expectations  Fox Business // Connecting Online Over Cannabis Forbes // Cannabis Company Fights Silicon Valley Shade Denver Post // MassRoots marijuana social network integrating seed-to-sale platform Inc. // MassRoots becomes the biggest hit in the marijuana business Fortune // Apple's Ban on Marijuana Networking Site Up in Smoke Wall Street Journal // Pitching Marijuana Startups Brings New Meaning to High Tech BBC // Looking for the Facebook of the Pot Industry        Ibox under construction...

Consensus Ratings for MASSROOTS INC (OTC:MSRT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A

MassRoots: Riding The Cannabis Wave - MassRoots, Inc. (OTCMKTS:MSRT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»MassRoots: Riding The Cannabis WaveJul.20.17 | About: MassRoots, Inc. (MSRT) Stone Fox Capital Long/short equity, growth at reasonable price, research analyst, Deep ValueStone Fox CapitalSummaryMassRoots is building up a technology platform for the growing state approvals for marijuana use.The stock remains depressed by the Nasdaq unwilling to approve an uplisting.Federal regulations remain a big catalyst for the industry.The company already has a vibrant app with over one million users for a social play in the cannabis sector.Legal use of cannabis is spreading like a wildfire. The country may even be close to federal rules that don't prohibit the use of marijuana for recreational use. With several cannabis-related stocks public, MassRoots (OTCQB:MSRT) provides a unique opportunity to play the explosive growth in legal use of pot. Possibly even better, the stock recently bounced down to the lows where the stock has traded since issues with uplisting to the Nasdaq has kept the stock below $1. MassRoots now has multiple catalysts for the business and the stock. Cannabis Market Status On July 2, Nevada became the 5th state to allow people to buy marijuana for recreational use. The state joins Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska on this list. MassRoots provides this convenient chart showing all of the states that have approved some form of legal marijuana use. 

Source: MassRoots presentation  One of the biggest issues holding back the development of cannabis-related businesses and the uplisting of MassRoots to the Nasdaq is the uncertainty regarding legal issues at the Federal level. State laws currently conflict with Federal regulation that prohibits the use of marijuana. Specifically, the Nasdaq blocked the uplisting of the stock back in May 2016 deeming the company as "aiding and abetting" the distribution of an illegal substance under Federal law. A couple of bills propose eliminating the federal classification of marijuana as a controlled substance: H.R. 1227 and H.R. 775.
 Republican Congressman Tom Garrett seeks with H.R. 1227 to remove marijuana from the federal schedule of controlled substances. The bill was introduced on February 27 so plenty of questions exist on whether this bill will get passed. Conversely, any move by the Trump administration, including attorney general Jeff Sessions that is against legalization, to further tighten Federal regulations could have devastating impacts to cannabis-related businesses and harm the stocks. According to data from Arcview Market Research (via Forbes), North American marijuana sales grew 30% to $6.7 billion in 2016. The research firm forecasts sales growing at an annual compounded rate of 25% to reach $20.2 billion by 2021. All of the trends support that federal prohibition of marijuana use will eventually get removed, but no guarantees exist. Social Play Transforming MassRoots is an interesting stock because the company is a technology play with a CTO that has experience at Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) along with other employees that have worked at some of the largest tech giants. Until the recent Odava acquisition, the company was primarily focused on the social aspect of cannabis, but the recent deal makes MassRoots more of a technology and compliance platform. The company has had an app on the App Store for years with the app getting banned back in November 2014 and reinstated in February 2015 due to consumer demand. Despite limited states with approved legal use, the app has crossed over 1,000,000 registered users from mostly California, Colorado, and Oregon. The app allows user reviews on products and dispensaries in the industry similar to how Yelp (YELP) works for restaurants and other local businesses. Consumers can rate products and strains based on their efficacy and other metrics as well as dispensaries. In a similar manner to Yelp, revenue from the app is based on advertising. The Odava platform offers software for the cannabis businesses from point-of-sale systems to inventory data to possibly crucial compliance data in an industry sure to require plenty of regulations. MassRoots hopes the integration of the Odava platform will allow for a connection with the app for consumers to check local inventories with consumer reviews.
 The Odava platform will provide a recurring revenue stream from dispensaries that will subscribe to the software package. The growth potential is enormous with each state that legalizes marijuana sales. In addition, the company is still in the process of expanding outside of their original focus market of Oregon that will grow the target market from 450 dispensaries to potentially 2,800 by 2019. 

Source: MassRoots presentation Finances Need Work MassRoots is clearly still in the startup phase. The combination of a target market only now opening up and questionable federal regulations leaves the future far brighter than the reality of past quarterly results. Q1 revenues were in the thousands and not the millions. Revenues did grow 44% YoY, but the base from last Q1 was below $100,000. The addition of Odava will boost revenue going forward along with the general growth in the industry. The company ended the quarter with $2.2 million in cash on the balance sheet after burning $2.5 million from operations in the quarter. The $7.4 million loss initially appears alarming, but the vast majority of the loss was due to the $5.2 million charge for stock-based compensation. MassRoots got over $4.4 million in funding from the exercising of warrants and states the need to raise additional funds in the next year amounting to at least $5 million. The company expects to raise a large amount of that from more exercised warrants, but MassRoots will likely need to raise additional funds from selling equity typical of a venture-type company in the early stages of growth. After issuing 3.25 million shares to Odava shareholders and granting 2.6 million shares to the founders that vest over two years, the company will have over 100 million shares outstanding. The current valuation approaches $60 million and naturally topped $100 million when the uplisting to the Nasdaq was in the process.
 As with any small company that isn't profitable, MassRoots faces the risks of not being able to raise capital at reasonable terms. As well, federal regulations remain a big hurdle for the industry where conflicts with state laws could prevent participation in typical capital markets. As well, the company needs to further gain mass scale with the social app to achieve the audience that attracts advertisers. Achieving these goals will come at a cost. Not to mention, a larger technology company could swoop in with access to significantly more capital to steal market share. MassRoots will want to ensure their product is top notch and potentially can expand beyond just cannabis. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that MassRoots is positioned to benefit from the regulatory trend to approve medical and recreational use of marijuana. The growing markets approving marijuana use will boost the business while potential federal legislation could provide another large boost to the stock. The risks that the market doesn't materialize as expected is further heightened by the lack of profits and a precariously low cash balance for the company. For those that think the positive trend in regulations governing marijuana use will only expand, MassRoots offers an ideal technology play that can easily expand as additional states are added to the approved list. As always, these small stocks are only recommended for diversified portfolios where the investor is willing to risk the capital invested.

I also would like if i could watch or upload a video - i keep getting an error message when i try to play videos or upload, saying "video cannot be played". Fix this and I will update my review to 5 stars!                            Great App. Hopefully it can expand to more states soon. Don't understand the concept of banning an app that is a cannabis social network and good research tool. Never realized conversation and research was a crime in and of itself. Anyway, the other hope is that some of the usability issues get worked out. The interface is a bit clunky and it seems many posts get out of sync and replicate or possibly disappear too. A good UI professional should be able to bring this app to the next level!                            It's a great community of people, but the app it's self is horrible. Plagged with problems that never get fixed and then more problems arise... The app freezes all the time. As well as constantly repeating.

It used to be really cool but now it just sucks. The administrators don't fix any issues, the app is now full of police, scammers, and bots and the real users are leaving in droves. I am actually on Google play now looking for another app to replace it. The creators and employees of massroots don't even think high enough their own app to even use it anymore. The app is bullshit and im deleting tonight.                    Xavier Selders          I was happy with the app until the local posting was taken away for areas where cannabis isn't legal.. So it's nothing but a tumblr knockoff at that point.

Garrett Bigelow  June 27, 2017                         Good app for the cannabis user, its like IG for cannabis users. How ever the spam bot accounts kinda ruin it, as do the "social media influencers " promoting products they have no part in, would be nice to see a sponsored post notification or a limit to this. Dms would be a great function to eliminate alot of these issues. Also the photo cropping is a little insane like come on let us do our thing, ive had to seriously crop pictures due to the restrictions. All and all its good but there is alot of room for improvement   Full Review       MassRoots, Inc.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
