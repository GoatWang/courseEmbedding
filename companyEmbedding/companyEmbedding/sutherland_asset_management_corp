The Company will maintain its existing residential mortgage origination platform, GMFS.
Thomas Capasse, Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Company, said, "This merger establishes Sutherland and its ReadyCap origination subsidiaries as the only public specialty-finance company focused on both lending to investors in and owner-occupants of small balance commercial properties and acquiring portfolios in the secondary market.  The underbanked SBC market and broad loan product offerings of the ReadyCap platform, Sutherland's ample balance sheet and demonstrated access to the securitization market supports strong returns on equity and a stable dividend to our shareholders."

Waterfall Asset Management


Our Company


Waterfall Asset Management is an SEC-registered specialist credit manager focused on high-yield Asset Backed Securities (ABS) and real estate and consumer debt investment.
Waterfall was founded in 2005 by Tom Capasse and Jack Ross, two individuals who helped establish the ABS industry, and who share 60+ combined years of proven ABS/Loan trading, banking and servicing leadership experience.
Capasse and Ross started the ABS Group at Merrill Lynch in the 1980s and conducted the first ABS issuances for many of the more than 40 ABS sectors in which Waterfall currently invests, including Small Balance Commercial Loans.
With $6.8 billion in assets under management ( as of 3/31/2017), Waterfall is noted for its relative value approach to investment.
Leveraging the extensive experience of its founding partners and expert portfolio managers, the firm sources, analyzes, and purchases non-traditional investments in an effort to seek an attractive risk/return profile.
By focusing on specialized "off the run" investments, Waterfall seeks to provide its clients with attractive, competitive returns that are uncorrelated to most traditional investment sectors. Waterfall Asset Management's headquarter offices are located in New York City.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions, and estimated expenses of this offering,
will be approximately $       million or approximately $       million if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full (based on the offering
price of $      per share, which is the mid-point of the initial public offering
price range shown on the cover page of this prospectus). We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders.

We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering to acquire and originate SBC
assets in accordance with our business strategy described in this prospectus and
for general business purposes, including the payment of fees and expense
reimbursements to our Manager. Depending on the availability of our target
assets, until we invest the net proceeds of this offering, we may pay down our
financing arrangements including those with affiliates of the underwriters and
may temporarily invest in interest-bearing short-term investments, including
money market accounts that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a
REIT. These initial investments are expected to provide a lower net return than
we will seek to achieve from our target assets.


We compete with numerous regional and community banks, specialty finance
companies, savings and loan associations and other entities, and we expect that
others may be organized in the future. The effect of the existence of additional
REITs and other institutions may be increased competition for the available
supply of SBC assets suitable for purchase, which may cause the price for such
assets to rise. Additionally, origination of SBC loans by our competitors may
increase the availability of SBC loans which may result in a reduction of
interest rates on SBC loans.

In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to our Manager's
professionals and their industry expertise, which may provide us with a
competitive advantage in sourcing transactions and help us assess acquisition
and origination risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential assets.
Additionally, we believe that we are currently one of only a handful of active
market participants in the secondary SBC loan market. Due to the special
servicing expertise needed to effectively manage these assets, the small size of
each loan, the uniqueness of the real properties that collateralize the loans
and the need to bring residential mortgage credit analysis into the underwriting
process, we expect competitive demand for these assets to remain constrained. We
seek to manage credit risk through our loan-level pre-origination or
pre-acquisition due diligence and underwriting processes, which as of September
30, 2015 has limited the amount of realized losses. However, we may not be able
to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that
we face.


Company Description
We are a real estate finance company that acquires, originates, manages,
services and finances primarily small balance commercial loans, or SBC loans.
SBC loans generally range in original principal amount of between $500,000 and
$10 million and are used by small businesses to purchase real estate


 used in
their operations or by investors seeking to acquire small multi-family, office,
retail, mixed use or warehouse properties. We also invest in asset-backed
securities where the underlying pool of assets consists primarily of SBC loans,
or SBC ABS, and other real estate-related investments. As of September 30, 2015,
we held a diversified portfolio of assets with an aggregate unpaid principal
balance, or UPB, of approximately $2.1 billion and a carrying value of
approximately $1.9 billion. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted
returns to our stockholders, primarily through dividends and secondarily through
capital appreciation. In order to achieve this objective, we will continue to
grow our investment portfolio by acquiring SBC loans and related investments and
originating new SBC loans.

We are externally managed and advised by Waterfall Asset Management, LLC, or our
Manager, an SEC registered investment adviser, whose investment professionals
source and evaluate our loan acquisitions and advise on our new loan origination
strategies. We have historically acquired performing, sub-performing, and
non-performing SBC loans and intend to continue to acquire these loans as part
of our business strategy. We consider a loan to be performing if the borrower is
current on 100% of the contractual payments due for principal and interest
during the most recent quarter or if the borrower's contractual status is
current and the borrower has made at least 66% of contractual payments due for
principal and interest in the most recent quarter. We consider a loan to be
sub-performing or non-performing if the borrower does not meet the criteria of a
performing loan. Our acquired performing loans represented approximately 63.0%
of the carrying value and 62.9% of the UPB of our total loan portfolio as of
September 30, 2015. We typically acquire sub-performing and non-performing loans
at a discount to their UPB when we believe that resolution of the loans will
provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our acquired sub-performing and
non-performing loans represented in the aggregate 3.3% of the carrying value and
7.9% of the UPB of our total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2015.

Through ReadyCap Holdings, LLC, our wholly-owned origination subsidiary,
including its subsidiaries, or ReadyCap, we have originated more than
$706.3 million in conventional loans in 29 states since ReadyCap's inception in
September 2012 and through September 2015. We originated $118.2 million of loans
in the third quarter of 2015. Our originated loans, all of which are currently
classified as performing loans, represented approximately 33.7% of the carrying
value and 29.3% of the UPB of our total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2015.
We will continue expanding our national origination platform by entering new
attractive markets in the United States. We also originate SBC loans for real
estate guaranteed under the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA,
Section 7(a) loan program, or the SBA Section 7(a) Program, through ReadyCap
using our license as a Small Business Lending Company, or SBLC, and recent
personnel hires. In the future, we may also originate SBC loans for real estate
under the SBA 504 loan program, pursuant to which the SBA guarantees
subordinated, long-term financing. Additionally, ReadyCap has been approved by
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, as an originator and
servicer for multi-family loan products under Freddie Mac's newly launched small
balance loan program, or the Freddie Mac program, and has commenced the
origination of loans under such program. ReadyCap employs 142 people focused on
originating and servicing SBC loans, including SBA loan originations.

Through Coldwell Banker Commercial Alliance, or CBCA, our wholly-owned brokerage
and advisory subsidiary, we provide sales, leasing, transaction management and
facilities management services in support of owners of smaller commercial
properties. CBCA employs 65 people dedicated to these activities on our behalf,
and we expect CBCA will emerge as an important source of SBC loan originations
referrals for us over time.

We trace our history back to August 2007 when the Victoria series of funds, or
the Victoria Funds, made their initial acquisition of an equity tranche of an
SBC loan securitization. The Victoria Funds were formed and managed by our
Manager to invest in a range of loans and asset backed securities, or ABS,
requiring active management to generate returns. Our business was operated as
part of the Victoria Funds until November of 2011 at which time the Victoria
Funds contributed substantially all of their SBC loans to our operating
partnership in exchange for substantially all of its partnership units
representing $371.5 million in assets and $262.2 million of equity capital. In
November and December of 2013, we completed a private placement, or the 2013
private placement, of shares of our common stock and our Operating Partnership
units, or OP units, pursuant to which we raised approximately $226 million of
equity capital. Concurrently with the closing of the 2013 private placement, we
engaged in a series of transactions, which we refer to as the REIT formation
transactions, in order to allow us to continue our business as a real estate
investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As part of
these transactions, we became a Maryland corporation, which was formed on
November 5, 2013, and the sole general partner of, and commenced conducting
substantially all of our businesses through, our operating partnership and its
subsidiaries.
