NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) today announced the 
      rebranding of its retail mutual fund family to AIG Funds from SunAmerica

      build greater awareness and visibility among our core audience of 
      financial professionals and consumers.”
    

      The name and logo under which the retail mutual funds are marketed is 
      being transitioned to the AIG brand. Each fund series, or registrant, 
      will retain “SunAmerica” in its name. There will be no change to the 
      retail mutual funds’ adviser (SunAmerica Asset Management, LLC) or to 
      the funds’ investment goals or strategies, portfolio managers, ticker 
      symbols or CUSIPs in connection with the transition. In addition to the 
      product rebranding, a new website will be available on February 28, 2017

Mutual funds are subject to risk including market risk as well as 
      additional risks, which vary depending on the type of fund. The 
      investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so

      risks, charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus, containing 
      this and other important information, can be obtained from your 
      financial adviser, or by calling the Sales Desk at 800-858-8850, ext. 
      6003. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Annuities are long-term products designed for retirement. Early withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. An investment in a variable annuity involves investment risk, including possible loss of principal. The contract, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the total amount invested. Retirement plans and accounts such as an IRA, 401(k), etc., are tax-deferred (and subject to required minimum distributions) regardless of whether or not they are funded with an annuity.Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains the investment objectives, risks, fees, charges, expenses and other information regarding the contract and underlying funds, which should be considered carefully before investing. A prospectus may be obtained from your financial advisor or by calling 1-800-445-7862. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. Annuities are issued by American General Life Insurance Company (AGL) or, in New York, by The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (US Life), except the Polaris Platinum Elite and Polaris Choice Elite variable annuities, which are issued by The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC) in all states. All products and features may not be available in all states. The purchase of an annuity is not required for, and is not a term of, the provision of any banking service or activity. The Company, its distributors and representatives are not authorized to give legal, tax or accounting advice. Applicable laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Any tax statements in this material are not intended to suggest the avoidance of U.S. federal, state or local tax penalties. For advice concerning your situation, consult your professional attorney, tax advisor or accountant. Variable annuities are distributed by AIG Capital Services, Inc. (ACS), Member FINRA, 21650 Oxnard St., Suite 750, Woodland Hills, CA 91367-4997, 1-800-445-7862. AGL, US Life, VALIC and ACS are members of American International Group, Inc. (AIG).
