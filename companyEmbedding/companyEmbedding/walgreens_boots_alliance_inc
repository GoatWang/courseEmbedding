Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Operations[edit]
Retail Pharmacy USA[edit]
Main articles: Walgreens and Duane Reade
Walgreens and Duane Reade operate within the Retail Pharmacy USA division of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Both businesses sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, and a range of household items, including personal care and beauty products. Walgreens provides access to consumer goods and services, plus pharmacy, photo studio, health and wellness services in the United States through its retail drugstores. Walgreens had 8,230 drugstores as of December 2015.[6] Walgreens runs several online stores, such as: Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.
Walgreens has stores in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced the purchase of competitor Rite Aid for $17.2 billion.[7]
Retail Pharmacy International[edit]
Main articles: Boots UK and Farmacias Benavides





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]

Walgreens to bring nearly 500 jobs to Chandler, Ariz., as it relocates Tempe support center
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Tuesday it is bringing nearly 500 jobs to Chandler, Ariz., as it relocates its Tempe pharmacy operations support center. The company will keep that Phoenix-area facility open as a pharmacy mail services support facility to support expected future growth, it said in a statement. The drugstore chain said 191 of the new jobs will meet or exceed the Maricopa County median wage for 2017. The company is moving 300 current positions from the Tempe facility to the new center, which will be 60,000 square feet. Jobs include pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and call center agents. Walgreens stock was up 0.7% Tuesday but has fallen 3% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10%.

Walgreens terminates Rite Aid merger, replaces with agreement to buy 2,186 stores
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday that it has terminated its merger agreement with Rite Aid Corp.  and has instead agreed to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. The consideration for the deal will be $5.175 billion in cash and the option for Rite Aid to become a member of the Walgreens group purchasing organization, an option that can be exercised through May 2019 and is subject to certain conditions. This new agreement replaces the merger agreement announced October 2015 and amended January 2017, along with the agreement to divest some Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc. , which was announced in December 2016. The agreement with Fred's has also been terminated and Walgreens will pay a $325 million termination fee. After the new transaction is approved, Walgreens will acquire the Rite Aid stores and assets over about six months and will eventually convert them to the Walgreens brand. Walgreens expects the transaction to be "modestly accretive" to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the initial closing, and expects synergies totaling $400 million that will be fully realized within three to four years. Walgreens shares are up 1.7% in premarket trading, Rite Aid shares are down 6.1%, and Fred's shares are down 27%. Walgreens shares are down nearly 7% for the year so far while Rite Aid shares are down more than 52% and Fred's are down 33.6% for the period. The S&P 500 index  is up 9% for 2017 to date.

Fred's stock plunges after deal to buy some Rite Aid stores was terminated
Shares of Fred's Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Thursday, after the agreement to buy 865 Rite Aid Corp.  was terminated. The agreement was originally announced on Dec. 20, 2016. The termination comes after Rite Aid agreed to sell 2,186 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. , which also terminates the companies' merger agreement. Fred's said it will receive a $25 million termination fee. "This is a disappointing outcome; however, the termination of the transaction has no impact on the Company's transformation strategy or our ability to execute," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The pharmacy and general merchandise chain's stock selloff puts it on track to open at the lowest level seen since Nov. 16, 2016. The stock had tumbled 34% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  had gained 9.0%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance tops earnings estimates, lifts low end of 2017 guidance
Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday it had net income of $1.162 billion, or $1.07 a share, in the second quarter, up from $1.103 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.33, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $1.30. Sales rose to $30.1 billion from $29.5 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $29.7 billion. "Our results this quarter continued to meet our expectations as strategic partnerships brought more patients to our U.S. pharmacies," Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said in a statement. Separately, the company also unveiled a new agreement with Rite Aid Inc. , replacing a 2015 merger agreement. The company raised the lower end of its 2017 EPS guidance to $4.98 to $5.08 from a prior $4.90 to $5.08. Shares rose 1.8% premarket, but are down 7% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.

Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Retail Pharmacy USA




Our Retail Pharmacy USA Division’s principal retail pharmacy brands are Walgreens and Duane Reade. Together, they form one of the largest drugstore chains in the USA.

Our Division operates 8,175* drugstores in 50* states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. As of August 2016, approximately 76 percent of the population of the USA lives within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade. 

We sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, as well as general merchandise, including household items, convenience and fresh foods, personal care, beauty care, photofinishing and candy. We provide customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, pharmacy, and health and wellness services in communities across America. We offer our products and services through drugstores, as well as through mail, telephone and online. We also provide specialty pharmacy and respiratory services, and operate retail clinics.

Our walgreens.com website receives an average of approximately 58 million† visits per month. Integrated with our e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive text messages alerting when a refill is due and other front-end functionality, such as photo and shopping features. 

Our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, pharmacy benefit managers and the public sector. Our stores sell branded and own brand general merchandise. In addition, approximately 400 Walgreens stores offer Healthcare Clinic or other provider retail clinic services.

Prescription drugs account for 67 percent† of sales, while retail products are 33 percent.

Overall, we filled approximately 740 million† prescriptions in 2016.  Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, we filled 928 million† prescriptions in 2016. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, government and private insurance, were approximately 97 percent† of prescription sales.

We utilize our extensive retail network as a channel to provide affordable quality health and wellness services to our customers and patients, as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. 

We have more than 76,000* healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals. Through them we expect to continue to play a growing role in government and employer efforts to control escalating healthcare costs.

Our loyalty program, Balance® Rewards, is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online and allows customers the opportunity to earn points for purchasing select merchandise in addition to receiving special pricing on select products when shopping with a rewards card.  Customers have the ability to instantly redeem rewards at our stores or through Walgreens.com. We had 87 million Balance® Rewards active members as of August 2016.

Our Division’s strategy is designed to further transform our traditional drugstore by offering ultimate convenience, driving the best customer loyalty and delivering extraordinary customer and patient care.  We seek to expand our product and service offerings across new channels and markets where, in addition to our stores, customers and patients can utilize our health system pharmacies, Walgreens.com, mobile applications and social media sites.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Retail Pharmacy USA[edit]
Main articles: Walgreens and Duane Reade
Walgreens and Duane Reade operate within the Retail Pharmacy USA division of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Both businesses sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, and a range of household items, including personal care and beauty products. Walgreens provides access to consumer goods and services, plus pharmacy, photo studio, health and wellness services in the United States through its retail drugstores. Walgreens had 8,230 drugstores as of December 2015.[6] Walgreens runs several online stores, such as: Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.

Retail Pharmacy International[edit]
Main articles: Boots UK and Farmacias Benavides

Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines.

Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Operations[edit]
Retail Pharmacy USA[edit]
Main articles: Walgreens and Duane Reade
Walgreens and Duane Reade operate within the Retail Pharmacy USA division of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Both businesses sell prescription and non-prescription drugs, and a range of household items, including personal care and beauty products. Walgreens provides access to consumer goods and services, plus pharmacy, photo studio, health and wellness services in the United States through its retail drugstores. Walgreens had 8,230 drugstores as of December 2015.[6] Walgreens runs several online stores, such as: Beauty.com, Drugstore.com and VisionDirect.com.
Walgreens has stores in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced the purchase of competitor Rite Aid for $17.2 billion.[7]
Retail Pharmacy International[edit]
Main articles: Boots UK and Farmacias Benavides





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.
Pharmaceutical Wholesale[edit]
Main article: Alliance Healthcare
Alliance Healthcare forms the main part of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name.

Walgreens to bring nearly 500 jobs to Chandler, Ariz., as it relocates Tempe support center
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Tuesday it is bringing nearly 500 jobs to Chandler, Ariz., as it relocates its Tempe pharmacy operations support center. The company will keep that Phoenix-area facility open as a pharmacy mail services support facility to support expected future growth, it said in a statement. The drugstore chain said 191 of the new jobs will meet or exceed the Maricopa County median wage for 2017. The company is moving 300 current positions from the Tempe facility to the new center, which will be 60,000 square feet. Jobs include pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and call center agents. Walgreens stock was up 0.7% Tuesday but has fallen 3% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10%.

Walgreens terminates Rite Aid merger, replaces with agreement to buy 2,186 stores
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday that it has terminated its merger agreement with Rite Aid Corp.  and has instead agreed to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. The consideration for the deal will be $5.175 billion in cash and the option for Rite Aid to become a member of the Walgreens group purchasing organization, an option that can be exercised through May 2019 and is subject to certain conditions. This new agreement replaces the merger agreement announced October 2015 and amended January 2017, along with the agreement to divest some Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc. , which was announced in December 2016. The agreement with Fred's has also been terminated and Walgreens will pay a $325 million termination fee. After the new transaction is approved, Walgreens will acquire the Rite Aid stores and assets over about six months and will eventually convert them to the Walgreens brand. Walgreens expects the transaction to be "modestly accretive" to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the initial closing, and expects synergies totaling $400 million that will be fully realized within three to four years. Walgreens shares are up 1.7% in premarket trading, Rite Aid shares are down 6.1%, and Fred's shares are down 27%. Walgreens shares are down nearly 7% for the year so far while Rite Aid shares are down more than 52% and Fred's are down 33.6% for the period. The S&P 500 index  is up 9% for 2017 to date.

Fred's stock plunges after deal to buy some Rite Aid stores was terminated
Shares of Fred's Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Thursday, after the agreement to buy 865 Rite Aid Corp.  was terminated. The agreement was originally announced on Dec. 20, 2016. The termination comes after Rite Aid agreed to sell 2,186 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. , which also terminates the companies' merger agreement. Fred's said it will receive a $25 million termination fee. "This is a disappointing outcome; however, the termination of the transaction has no impact on the Company's transformation strategy or our ability to execute," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The pharmacy and general merchandise chain's stock selloff puts it on track to open at the lowest level seen since Nov. 16, 2016. The stock had tumbled 34% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  had gained 9.0%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance tops earnings estimates, lifts low end of 2017 guidance
Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday it had net income of $1.162 billion, or $1.07 a share, in the second quarter, up from $1.103 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.33, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $1.30. Sales rose to $30.1 billion from $29.5 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $29.7 billion. "Our results this quarter continued to meet our expectations as strategic partnerships brought more patients to our U.S. pharmacies," Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said in a statement. Separately, the company also unveiled a new agreement with Rite Aid Inc. , replacing a 2015 merger agreement. The company raised the lower end of its 2017 EPS guidance to $4.98 to $5.08 from a prior $4.90 to $5.08. Shares rose 1.8% premarket, but are down 7% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. is an American holding company headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois that owns Walgreens, Boots and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesale and distribution companies. The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years.
Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.[2] The new holding company began trading on the NASDAQ on December 31, 2014.[3]
The combined business has operations in over 25 countries. Walgreens had formerly operated solely within the United States and its territories, while Alliance Boots operated a more international business.
In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance published its fourth quarter earnings report. Net sales in fiscal year 2015 increased by 35.4% to $103.4 billion, and net earnings rose to $4.2 billion.[4][5]

Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses.
Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a HP picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints via Bluetooth, USB or CD. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.
Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.
The remainder of the division is made up of the pharmacies Benavides in Mexico and Farmacias Ahumada (FASA) in Chile.

It operates twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.[8] Internationally, Alliance Healthcare supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to over 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from over 350 distribution centers in 19 countries.[9]
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, Alliance Healthcare provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly changing and adapting their approaches to distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics, direct deliveries to pharmacies, and specialized medicine delivery including related home healthcare.[citation needed]
The division's Alphega Pharmacy network provides a range of services for independent pharmacies, including branding, professional training and patient care, retail support services and supply benefits together with pharmacy and IT support.[10]
Product brands[edit]
Boots produces a large number of brands that Alliance Boots and Walgreens sought to launch internationally following the first share purchase in 2012.[citation needed] The majority are produced by its subsidiary, BCM Limited, which manufactures both own-brand and third-party medicines, as well as cosmetic ranges including No 7, Kangol, FCUK, Soltan, and Botanics. BCM has facilities in the UK, Germany, and France.[11] BCM Specials manufactures bespoke non-licensed medicines for UK hospital and retail pharmacies.[citation needed]
Launched in 1935, No7 is best known for its anti-aging beauty serums, developed in Nottingham that first appeared in 2007. The range comprises products designed to target the aging concerns of specific age groups. No7 became available in Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the USA from November 2012, beginning in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Launched in 1939, Soltan markets its UVA 5-star protection, a standard of protection developed by Boots and now adopted as the benchmark for suncare products in the UK.[citation needed] Although in both 2004 and 2015 Watchdog, a BBC consumer investigative TV program, and cited on BBC News; plus the consumer WHICH? Magazine, each did an investigation finding the 5-star rating was unsubstantiated, and skincare experts declared it to be far less safe than claimed.[12][13][14]
First launched in 1995, the Botanics range, developed in partnership with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, uses plant extracts in a variety of products, and includes a range of organic products. The Botanics range is also available through third party retailers.[citation needed]
The Boots own brand range of products includes skincare, medicines, healthcare products and many more. Boots Laboratories skincare range for independent pharmacy customers was launched in France and Portugal in 2008/09and is also sold in Spain, Italy and Germany.[15]
Boots launched Almus, a brand of generic prescription drugs, in the UK in 2003.[16] It is now sold in five countries and is an umbrella brand for a wide range of lower cost generic medicines. Alliance Boots placed considerable emphasis on the design of the packaging in an attempt to reduce the number of errors by the dispensing chemist and by the patient relating to incorrect dosage which can result in either a dangerous accidental overdose or an equally dangerous under dose.[citation needed]
Walgreens has a self-branded line of products, "Well at Walgreens".[17]
In 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid £140 million (about $250 million) for UK skincare brand Liz Earle Naturally Active, an Avon subsidiary since 2010.[18] Liz Earle Beauty Co co-founder Liz Earle, 'one of the biggest names in the beauty industry'[19] stayed on as an 'ambassador'[20] after selling the company for an undisclosed sum[21] and told her own Liz Earle Wellbeing magazine's website that '...alongside my new digital and print publishing venture...at the moment I’m still connected to Liz Earle Beauty Co and continue to work as a consultant to the brand that carries my name. I’m involved in new product development...'[22]
