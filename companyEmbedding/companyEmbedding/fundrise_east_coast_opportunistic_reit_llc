History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]

After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller.

After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]

Strategy


The East Coast eREIT focuses on a balanced approach of acquiring both debt and equity investments in commercial real estate assets located specifically in the East Coast region. The eREIT™ intends to target  investments with fixed rates of return that maximize current income, and equity investments with significant potential value creation. In particular, the East Coast eREIT intends to capitalize on opportunistic pricing inefficiencies in the East Coast multifamily market through (i) acquiring value­-add and lease-­up properties; (ii) acquiring assets that require repositioning or re­development; (iii) investing in ground ­up new development projects; and (iv) providing senior debt, mezzanine debt and recapitalization equity capital for existing transactions.The East Coast multifamily rental market is benefitting from demographic changes, improved job growth, and strong economic dynamics. The East Coast eREIT™ aims to invest in commercial real estate assets located in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, as well as the Washington, DC, and Philadelphia, PA metro areas.

                How Crowdfunding is Expanding the REIT Market            


    By Warren Cassell | October 21, 2016 — 8:49 AM EDT    






Share















































Real estate investment companies are using new U.S. crowdfunding rules to raise additional capital for new vehicles that are generating superior returns.
Fundrise's REIT Expansion
​Fundrise, one of the pioneers of the online real estate crowdfunding industry, introduced this week, three new funds to their family of eREITs™, which  essentially are a public but non-traded REIT. The additions are the Fundrise West Coast Opportunistic REIT, Fundrise Midland Opportunistic REIT, and Fundrise East Coast Opportunistic REIT. Until now, Fundrise managed two REITs, one being income-focused and other being focused on growth, that both made investments throughout the country. However, the new REITs will each target specific geographic locations in the U.S. Income and growth will be their main investment objectives.
Fast Fundraising
Fundrise says that it has raised over $84 million from individual investors since debuting its first REIT in December 2015, and its second one a little more than five months ago. The company says it's on track to raise a total of $250 million in a little over 12 months. (See also, Is Fundrise's New eREIT Right for You?)
Strong Returns
Fundrise's Growth eREIT™ investors are earning an approximate 8% annualized dividend, while Income eREIT™ investors earn approximately 11.25% gross annualized, Jordan Sale, director of marketing at Fundrise, told Investopedia. (See also, How To Analyze Real Estate Investment Trusts.)
RealtyMogul.com’s MogulREIT I is another crowdfunded REIT that was launched this year. Like Fundrise's REITs, the MogulREIT makes debt and equity investments in various types of commercial property with an aim to distribute a steady stream of income. The REITs NAV is currently fixed until September 2017 at $10 per share, and its first dividend payout was distributed to investors earlier this month, which equates to an approximate 8% return on an annualized basis.  
To put those returns into perspective, last year the FTSE NAREIT Composite increased by only 2.05%.
Crowdfunding's Driver
Equity crowdfunding has been on the rise ever since Regulation A+ was finalized and adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) early last year. It essentially exempts companies from the need to register certain small issues of securities, and also allows them to offer those securities to non-accredited investors, helping to attract funds.
