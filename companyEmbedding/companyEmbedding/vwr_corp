VWR International is an American company involved in the distribution of research laboratory products, with over 1,200,000 items to more than 250,000 customers in North America and Europe. The U.S. division is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania. VWR ranked #91 in 2006, and #77 in 2005, in Forbes list of largest American private companies.[2] Suppliers include Applied Scientific, 3B Scientific Duracell, Kimberly-Clark, Bel-Art Products, and Welch Allyn.[3] VWR primarily serves the government, biotechnology, life science, education, electronics and pharmaceutical sectors. In 2010, the company maintained operations in 25 countries and processed approximately 50,000 order lines daily from a logistical network, which includes 25 strategically located distribution centers.[4]
History[edit]
VWR was formed in the late 1920s by George Van Waters and Nat Rogers as a small chemical company.[5] Since then, the company evolved to focus on the laboratory market. It also has a presence in the cleanroom, safety, and clinical markets.
VWR owns a group of companies under the unofficial umbrella "VWR Education." These companies include Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories and Edmund Scientific Corporation.[6] In August 1989, VWR purchased Wards's Science [1] and Sargent-Welch Scientific Company.[7]
In September, 1995, VWR completed their purchase of Baxter's Industrial division, creating a much larger company. The capital was primarily obtained from Merck KGaA, a German chemical manufacturer (known as EMD Chemicals in the U.S. and Canada) who later purchased VWR and merged them with Merck Eurolab, creating a global laboratory distributor. In 2004, VWR became a limited partnership controlled by investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.
In 2007, CD&R sold VWR to another private equity company, Madison Dearborn Partners.
In 2010, VWR moved its world headquarters to Radnor, Pennsylvania.
On June 1, 2011 VWR International acquired BioExpress Corp (formerly ISC BioExpress), raising concerns of monopolization of the laboratory supplies sector along with Thermo Fisher Scientific.[8]
Controversy has arisen about a 2010 decision by VWR to close its unionized Brisbane, CA distribution center, moving operations to a non-unionized Visalia, CA facility. This facility has now voted in the union for equal pay for equal work. They pay the Material Handlers $10 an hour when the other distribution centers start at a much higher rate. VWR will not allow this facility to be unionized and will not work out a contract.[9][10][11]
On October 2, 2014, VWR's IPO raised $536 million, estimating the value of the company at close to $5 billion.[12]
In January 2016, VWR acquired Therapak Corporation, an assembler and distributor of medical convenience kits with locations in Claremont, CA, Buford, GA, Hayes, UK and Singapore.

Create a VWR Profile

  


                          		Welcome! You have started to create a VWR International profile. Over the next few screens, we will ask you to provide information about yourself so that VWR may serve you better. Please feel free to read over our Privacy Policy before creating your account.









Why Do I Need a Profile?
Each time that you come back and visit our site, you will be able to log in and access information that is specific to you. In your profile, you have the option to store personal settings as well as purchasing and payment information. A profile will also provide access to features on the site like order history, order approvals and order status.

                      
                      For more information about profiles and accounts, read about Account Basics.
You do not need to register for an online profile to simply browse and search on vwr.com. However, a profile is needed to make a purchase and see your contract price.



I Have a VWR Shipping Account Number



Permanent Profile


 
If you already have a VWR Shipping Account Number, a Permanent Profile allows you to use all of the features on the VWR web site. This profile will have one or more Shipping Account Numbers associated with it and multiple payment methods are available. It will allow you to see your Contract Pricing and Availability, once enabled.






Guest Profile


 
A guest profile will let you search, browse and navigate vwr.com. You will be able to view all products and purchase many of the items using a credit card for payment. Basic site features are available when using a guest profile, but advanced features (such as contract pricing and availability) require a Permanent Profile.
Please do not register for a guest profile if you already have a VWR Shipping Account Number - this may cause delays to your order and lead to additional charges. If you do not know your VWR Shipping Account Number, please call 1-800-932-5000.
Please note that Guest Profiles are NOT eligible for tax exempt status.
