Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Pennsylvania:













What else should I know before hiring Thomas E Lynch



Pennsylvania has some of the lightest regulations on home improvement contractors in the US and there is no financial or criminal background check performed on contractors by the State. The Pennsylvania State Police maintain a publicly accessible database so consumers can run their own background check before making a hire if they are so inclined.
