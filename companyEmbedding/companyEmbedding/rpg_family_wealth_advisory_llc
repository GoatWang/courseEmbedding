October 03, 2011 09:14 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Risk 
      Paradigm Group LLC (“RPg”) announced today that it is expanding its 
      business operations to create a fully-integrated financial services firm 
      that will provide a diversified suite of investment products and 
      services to clients. The firm is launching a family wealth advisory 
      business through the addition of a Boston-based advisor team from Morgan 
      Stanley Smith Barney (“MSSB”) led by David M. Gatti, and the acquisition 
      of the investment advisory branch of RAM Financial Group in Austin, 
      Texas, led by Mark B. Reinking. Mr. Gatti has been named Chief Executive 
      Officer of RPg.
    


      The firm also is expanding its asset management product offering with a 
      new fund, ICP Endowment Stability Fund (“ESF”), which will complement 
      the firm’s flagship Diversified Risk Parity Fund (“DRP”, NASDAQ: DRPIX).
    

      In addition, RPg announced that it is partnering with Dynasty Financial 
      Partners to enhance its family wealth advisory and asset management 
      capabilities and better serve clients as a fully integrated financial 
      services firm.
    

      “I am thrilled to be joining the firm at such an important time in the 
      market,” said Mr. Gatti, CEO of RPg. “Our new diversified offering is 
      backed by one of the finest teams in the industry and unites a distinct 
      set of values focused solely on managing risk and delivering consistent 
      returns. We offer access to world-class products and services, and 
      unbiased advice to meet the sophisticated investing and wealth 
      management needs of our clients.”
    

INTRODUCTION OF RPg FAMILY WEALTH ADVISORY


RPg 
      Family Wealth Advisory, the newly formed wealth management business, 
      will be headed by Mr. Reinking and will offer comprehensive family 
      wealth planning strategies and fiduciary services, including investment 
      advisory and asset management; philanthropic, retirement and estate 
      planning; risk control & liquidity solutions; and private banking 
      services. Mr. Gatti and Mr. Reinking are bringing to RPg Family Wealth 
      Advisory key members of their respective wealth management teams, 
      including Hugh Maginnis of MSSB, and Jason McGinty and Adam Reinking of 
      RAM Financial Group, who join RPg as Partners.
    

      “Our approach to multi-generational wealth management is about the 
      convergence of values,” said Mark Reinking, Managing Director of RPg 
      Family Wealth Advisory. “David and I were introduced by one of our 
      mutual Family Office clients. At RAM, we had designed and implemented 
      their estate insurance plan, and David had been managing their hedge 
      fund book. Our mutual client recognized that our teams approach due 
      diligence and risk management very similarly, and thought we would enjoy 
      meeting one another. Indeed we did. Subsequently, David and I have 
      worked jointly for scores of clients over the last three years, and I am 
      delighted now to converge our teams at RPg.”
    

      The new Family Wealth Advisory will complement RPg’s existing 
      alternative asset management business, RPg 
      Asset Management, which specializes in the comprehensive analysis, 
      measurement and application of risk management principles to proprietary 
      and custom diversified investment portfolios for foundations, charities, 
      endowments and qualified private investors. The combined offering will 
      allow RPg to provide clients with diversified financial services from 
      offices in Austin, Boston and Chicago.
    

ADDITION OF ENDOWMENT STABILITY FUND TO RPg ASSET MANAGEMENT


      RPg already manages its flagship DRP Fund, an SEC-registered alternative 
      mutual fund structure that provides hedge fund return stream replication 
      with actively managed risk overlays. It will now be complemented by ESF, 
      a multi-strategy, multi-asset class fund of hedge funds managed to 
      emulate the returns of university endowment portfolios.
    

      “The addition of ESF aligns our collective view of managing risk first,” 
      said Chris Jensen, RPg’s Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director 
      of ESF. “From that perspective, ESF and DRP Fund give both investment 
      professionals, and clients, alternative solutions that provide an array 
      of non-correlating strategies and liquidity terms.”
    

      “The strength of our asset management offering lies in our ability to 
      move beyond traditional investment management by employing a unique 
      quantitative and qualitative approach to deliver exposure to 
      non-traditional asset class investments,” said Jason McGinty, Portfolio 
      Manager of RPg Asset Management. “Through the addition of ESF, our 
      clients gain access to a diverse asset allocation strategy, while 
      receiving the benefits of truly objective and transparent portfolio 
      management.”
    

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH DYNASTY FINANCIAL


      RPg also announced today a partnership with Dynasty 
      Financial Partners (“Dynasty”), a leading provider of investment and 
      technology platforms for independent financial advisors with 
      sophisticated client needs, to enhance the firm’s asset management and 
      family wealth advisory divisions. The open-architecture platform at 
      Dynasty, founded by a group of former Citi Smith Barney executives and 
      led by Todd 
      Thomson and Shirl 
      Penney, comprises the best technology, research, solutions and 
      products available in the industry today. RPg will have access to a 
      broad range of services powered by Dynasty including custody, contact 
      management systems, investment analytics technology, and proposal 
      generation.
    

      “In today’s marketplace, it is absolutely essential that financial 
      advisors have the autonomy and independence to act as true fiduciaries 
      for their clients,” said Chris Jensen, RPg’s Chief Operating Officer. 
      “Utilizing Dynasty’s comprehensive suite of technology and investment 
      solutions will allow us to focus on our investment strategies and better 
      serve our clients across the country.”
    

      Shirl Penney, President and CEO of Dynasty, said, “It is a pleasure for 
      Todd and me to be working with David Gatti again, and to welcome RPg to 
      the Dynasty network. As an advocate for independence, we value RPg’s 
      commitment to providing truly objective solutions and superior results 
      for their clients. David has long been considered an expert in the 
      private wealth management industry – he was recognized for his talent by 
      earning the Private Wealth Associate distinction from the Citi Family 
      Office, an internal honor shared by less than 2% of the advisors at MSSB 
      – and we are thrilled to partner with him and his team.”
    

      Mr. Gatti said, “Acting as a transparent fiduciary for our clients is 
      our top priority. With the help of Dynasty, a firm who shares RPg’s 
      vision for how clients should be served, every aspect of our asset 
      management and family wealth advisory businesses is enhanced. It’s truly 
      a privilege to join the Dynasty platform, which offers the best 
      resources for our clients’ needs along with a talented, full-service 
      team to guide us to the best services for our businesses.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
