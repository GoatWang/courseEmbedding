(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as filed with the SEC and other financial information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Overview  We have transitioned our business from mining to clean new energy, and mainly focus on the solar photovoltaic, or "PV", downstream market at present stage. We are currently in the development stage with the goal of becoming a turnkey developer and Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor of solar PV energy facilities. We intend to design, engineer, construct, market and sell high-quality PV energy facilities for commercial and utility applications to local markets. The Company decided not to recognize the revenue of electricity supply for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the uncertain collectability.  Before June 1, 2012, we were engaged in exploration for commercially recoverable metal-bearing mineral deposits. On June 1, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Xunyang Yongjin Mining Co., Ltd to transfer our mining exploration rights for a cash payment of $2,380,612 (RMB 15,000,000). Further, on December 30, 2013, our subsidiary, Shaanxi Changjiang Mining &New Energy Co., Ltd. ("Shaanxi Changjiang"), entered into Equity Transfer Agreements with each of Zhang Hong Jun, a director of the Company and owner of a controlling interest in the Company (holding 54.43% as of December 31, 2013), and Wang Sheng Li, a director and shareholder of the Company (holding 11.52% as of December 31, 2013), to sell Shaanxi Changjiang's entire 60% interest in Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., ("East Mining" and formerly referred to as "Dongfang Mining") for a total consideration of $885,696 (RMB 5,400,000). The consideration payable to the Company was used to offset amounts owed to each of the acquirers. Each of the acquirers obtained 30% equity in this transaction.  We also hold land use rights in a land parcel and we lease a portion of the land use rights on the 5.7 square kilometer parcel to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd (previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.),, a company with Zhang Hong Jun, a director of the Company and owner of a controlling interest in the Company. The term of the lease agreement is from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2029. Our land use rights are amortized over their 50 year term. The Land use right was our largest asset, with an annual rent of approximately $1.2 million (RMB 7, 500,000).  As of December 31, 2016, we only received rent payment of 2011 and no any collection afterwards. Due to the uncertain collectability, we decided to write off all the receivable related to land lease of $3,618,818 (equivalent to RMB 22,500,000) during the year of 2015 and decided not to recognize any revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.  Our land use rights are amortized over 50-year term. The following is a summary of the book value of our land use rights as of December 31, 2016:  Cost $ 18,432,882 Less: Accumulated amortization 4,721,760 Land use rights, net $ 13,711,122  The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $385,345 and $411,717, respectively.  As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,926,913 as of December 31, 2016, which includes net loss of $562,860 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's operations used cash was $120,988 in 2016.  In the past, the Company relied on the loan received from the related parties, and cash generated from operations to meet its operating requirements. Although the Company was successful in the past in obtaining financing, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financings will still be favorable. However in the event that we have insufficient cash to meet our operating requirements, our related companies and shareholders will commit to provide loan to maintain liquidity.  We believe that we have adequate capital to assure that we will be able to meet our obligations or obtain sufficient capital to complete our plan of operations for the next twelve (12) months.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015  Sales revenue  We generated $12,356 of revenue from sales of solar PV energy for the year ended December 31, 2016, comparing to revenue of $16,718 for the year ended December 31, 2015. However, due to the collectability is not reasonably assured, we decided to write off the revenue from the fourth quarter of 2016 in the amount of $3,038. As a result, the revenue was $12,356for the year ended December 31, 2016, while the total revenue was $16,718 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Operating Expense  Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to $570,156 from comparable figure of $4,674,545 for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of $4,104,389, or 88%. The operating expenses decreased significantly because we wrote off a total balance of $3,897,124 due from related parties and total balance of $71,820 receivable from third parties due to uncertain collectability at the year end of 2015. And the depreciation expense decreased to $30,725, from comparable figure of $53,174. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 slightly decreased by $26,372, or 6.41%, due to the depreciation of RMB to USD, and no addition or disposal occurred for Land use rights.  Net Loss  Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $562,741, as compared to a net loss of $4,655,722 for year ended December 31, 2015. The significant improvement in our operating results was mainly attributable to the bad debt expense of $3,968,944 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Comprehensive Loss  Our comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1,301,939 compared with comprehensive loss of $5,321,924 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The other comprehensive income (loss) for each period only referred to the foreign currencies translation gain (loss), between U.S. Dollar and Chinese Yuan RMB (or Hong Kong Dollar for Wah Bon). The exchange rate of RMB against USD depreciated from 6.4907 as of December 31, 2015 to 6.9437 as of December 31, 2016, resulting in the other comprehensive loss of $739,198 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with the other comprehensive loss of $666,202 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Stockholders' Equity  Stockholders' equity decreased to $10,247,410 as of December 31, 2016, or approximately 11%, from $11,487,393 as of December 31, 2015. The significant decrease was primarily due to the net loss 562,741 the other comprehensive loss of $739,198, and offset by an increase in additional paid-in capital of $61,956 for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The increase in additional paid in capital was due to an exemption from the loan of RMB367,464 (approximately $55,316) owed to Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd, a related party of the Company, as Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd had been officially cancelled in business on April 29, 2016, and an exemption from the salary payable of RMB 44,111(approximately $6,640) that had been paid by Shaanxi Dukang Liquor Group, a related party.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows From Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities of $115,183 for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to net loss of $562,741 The adjustments to reconcile our net loss to net cash flow mainly include depreciation and amortization expense of $416,070, allowance for doubtful accounts of $35,816 an increase in due from related party of $10,940, an increase in other current assets and prepayments of $567, and an increase in other payables and accrued liabilities of $6,045.  Cash Flows From Investing Activities  There is no cash flow in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016  Table of Contents  Cash Flows From Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities of $111,087 for the year ended December 31, 2016 was the proceeds from related parties.  Net cash provided by financing activities of $68,426 for the year ended December 31, 2015 was the proceeds from related parties.  General  As in previous year, we have access to short and long term loans of cash from our directors or other related parties.  The Company borrowed $111,087 from related parties for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company borrowed $68,426 from related parties for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our current assets decreased by $1,703 and total assets decreased by $2,574,758 respectively. The increased current assets were resulted from our increase in other current asset and prepayment and the decreased total assets were mainly due to the writing off receivables due from related parties and depreciation of RMB to USD.  We have cash of $12,512 and $13,550 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The decrease of cash balance was mainly due to the fact that we did not receive any cash for our business for the year ended December 31, 2016.  However, we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the next twelve months.  Financing  We anticipated that cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to sustain our daily operations for the next twelve months.  Inflation  Our management believes that inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations in 2016.  Going Concern  We had a working capital deficit of $1,191,997 as of December 31, 2016 and had a negative cash flow from operating activities amounted to $115,183 for the year ended December 31, 2016. If we cannot generate enough cash flow from its operating activities, we will need to consider other financing methods such as borrowing from banking institutions or raising additional capital through new equity issuance. There are no assurances that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. We plan to continue to control our administrative expenses in the coming periods as well as further develop our sales from our main business.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Contractual Obligations  None.  Table of Contents  Basis of Presentation  The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP").  This basis of accounting differs in certain material respects from that used for the preparation of the books of account of the Company, which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and the relevant financial regulations applicable to enterprises with limited liabilities established in the PRC ("PRC GAAP"), the accounting standards used in the places of their domicile. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect necessary adjustments not recorded in the books of account of the Company to present them in conformity with US GAAP.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our discussion and analysis of our financial conditions and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements.  An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions which are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and affect our financial condition and results of operations.  The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, both significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred or services have been rendered and accepted, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  We are currently leasing the land use right to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd., a related company with the same controlling person, for the development and operation of a theme park. We generally collect the annual rent every year, and then recognize land use right leasing revenue over the beneficial period described by the agreement, as the revenue is realized or realizable and earned.  We also supply electricity power by the solar PV energy segment. The electricity revenue is earned and recognized upon transmission of electricity to Heyang County Huanghe Bay Resort Hotel Co., Ltd., a related company with the same controlling person.  Related Party  A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, member of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting party might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.  Table of Contents  Our related parties are the following individuals and entities: (i) Mr. Wang Sheng Li (a director of the Company), Mr. Chen Weidong (our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board), Ms Li Ping (a director of the Company), and Ms. Chen Min (a director of the Company), all of whom are shareholders of the Company; (ii) Mr. Zhang Hong Jun, who is currently a director and controlling shareholder of the Company; (iii) Ms. Li Ping (our Chief Financial Officer and who has the same name with our Director Ms. Li Ping); and (iv) the following companies: Shaanxi Jiuzu Shaokang Liquor Co., Ltd.(Previously Shaanxi Baishui Dukang Liquor Development Co., Ltd.), Shaanxi Baishui Dukang Marketing Management Co., Ltd.(Previously Huitong World Property Superintendent Co.,Ltd.), Shaanxi Xi Deng Hui Development Stock Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Baishui Dukang Brand Management Co., Ltd., Zhongke Aerospace & Agriculture Development Stock Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd (Previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.), Shaanxi Changfa Industrial Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Tangrenjie Advertising Media Co., Ltd. (Previously "Shaanxi Changjiang Zhongxiayou Investment Co., Ltd.), Shaanxi Dukang Liquor Trading Co., Ltd., Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., Heyang County Huanghe Bay Resort Hotel Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Baishui Dukang Liquor Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Baishui Dukang Old Workshop Liquor Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Jiusheng Brand Operation Management Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Lantian Poverty Alleviation Investment Co., Ltd.,and Heyang County Huanghe Bay Resort Training Reception Center Co., Ltd.  Cash flows from due from related parties are classified as cash flows from investing activities. Cash flows from due to related parties are classified as cash flows from financing activities.  Financial Instruments  We do not employ derivative financial instruments and have no foreign exchange contracts. Our financial instruments are primarily cash and cash equivalents, but also include receivables, payables, long term debt, and short term notes. We do not try to manage risk of foreign exchange rates or engage in hedging activities.  Foreign Exchange Rates  All of our sales are in the Chinese currency, RMB, but our financial reporting is in U. S. dollars. We are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in our reports. There can be no assurance that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our financial reporting and a negative effect on the prices of our securities.  Foreign currency translation gain or loss is reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and stockholders' equity. The translation loss recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016 was $739,198, and the translation loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $666,202. The equity accounts were stated at their historical rate.  Mar 31, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	 


	 


	The accounting policies and methods followed in preparing these unaudited consolidated financial statements are those used by China Changjiang Mining & New Energy Company, Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not conform in all respects to the disclosure and information that is required for annual consolidated financial statements. The year-end consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosure required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements of the Company.


	 


	In the opinion of management, all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for fair statement have been included in these interim consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2017.


	 



	(a) Going Concern



	 


	The Company had a working capital deficit of $1,209,013 as of March 31, 2017 and had a negative cash flow from operating activities amounted to $30,060 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. If the Company cannot generate enough cash flow from its operating activities, it will need to consider other financing methods such as borrowing from banking institutions or raising additional capital through new equity issuance. There are no assurances that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. The Company plans to continue to control its administrative expenses in the coming periods as well as further develop its sales from its main business.


	 


	These conditions and uncertainties raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	(b) Foreign Currency Translation



	 


	Exchange rates applied for the foreign currency translation during the period are as follows:


	 




	USD to RMB


	 







	 




	 





	March 31,




	2017





	 




	 





	December 31,




	2016





	 






	Period end USD: RMB exchange rate




	 




	 



	6.8905



	 




	 




	 



	6.9437



	 






	Average periodic USD: RMB exchange rate




	 




	 



	6.8882



	 




	 




	 



	6.6430



	 






	 




	 




	F-5







	 






	Table of Contents






	 




	USD to HKD


	 







	 




	 





	March 31,




	2017





	 




	 





	December 31,




	2016





	 






	Period end USD: HKD exchange rate




	 




	 



	7.7705



	 




	 




	 



	7.7543



	 






	Average periodic USD: HKD exchange rate




	 




	 



	7.7602



	 




	 




	 



	7.7617



	 






	 


	HKD is pegged to USD and hence there is no significant translation adjustment impact on these consolidated financial statements.


	 


	RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into USD at the rates used in translation.


	 



	(c) Earnings/Loss per share



	 


	Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing earnings/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed in a manner similar to basic earnings/loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.


	 



	(d) Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-03,

	“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (Topic 250) and Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)”

	. This pronouncement amends the SEC’s reporting requirements for public filers in regard to new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that have not yet been adopted. Companies are to provide qualitative disclosures if they have not yet implemented an accounting standards update. Companies should disclose if they are unable to estimate the impact of a specific pronouncement, and provide disclosures including a description of the effect on accounting policies that the registrant expects to apply. These provisions apply to all pronouncements that have not yet been implemented by registrants. There are additional provisions that relate to corrections to several other prior FASB pronouncements. The Company has incorporated language into other recently issued accounting pronouncement notes, where relevant for the corrections in FASB ASU 2017-03. The Company is implementing the updated SEC requirements on not yet adopted accounting pronouncements with these consolidated financial statements.

	The difference for the balance of cost was mainly due to the fluctuation of exchange rate of USD to RMB.


	 


	Amortization expenses were $92,907 and $97,861 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

	6. INCOME TAXES



	 


	The Company did not have income tax expense or income tax payable due to the use of net loss carryover from prior years.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017, the Company had net taxable operating loss carry forwards of approximately $1,908,861. The PRC income tax allows the enterprises to offset their future taxable income with taxable operating losses carried forward in a 5-year period. The management believes that the Company’s cumulative losses arising from recurring business in recent years constituted significant negative evidence that most of the deferred tax assets would not be realizable and this evidence outweighed the expectations that the Company would generate future taxable income. The valuation allowance of $477,215 was recorded.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIALCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 


	In addition to the historical information contained herein, we make statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are forward-looking statements. Sometimes these statements will contain words such as "believes," "expects," "intends," "should," "will," "plans," and other similar words. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, assumptions about our future ability to increase income streams, reduce and control costs, to grow revenue and earnings, and our ability to obtain additional debt and/or equity capital on commercially reasonable terms, none of which is certain. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors included in our periodic reports with the SEC. Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our March 31, 2017 unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this quarterly report and with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016.


	 




	Overview




	 


	We have transitioned our business from mining to clean new energy, and mainly focus on the solar photovoltaic, or “PV”, downstream market at present stage. We are currently in the development stage with the goal of becoming a turnkey developer and Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor of solar PV energy facilities. We intend to design, engineer, construct, market and sell high-quality PV energy facilities for commercial and utility applications to local markets.


	 


	Before June 1, 2012, we were engaged in exploration for commercially recoverable metal-bearing mineral deposits. On June 1, 2012, we entered into an agreement with XunyangYongjin Mining Co., Ltd to transfer our mining exploration rights for a cash payment of $2,380,612 (RMB 15,000,000). Further, on December 30, 2013, our subsidiary, Shaanxi Changjiang Mining & New Energy Co., Ltd. ("Shaanxi Changjiang"), entered into Equity Transfer Agreements with each of Zhang Hong Jun, a director of the Company and owner of a controlling interest in the Company (holding 54.42% as of March 31, 2017), and Wang Sheng Li, a director and shareholder of the Company (holding 2.36% as of March 31, 2017), to sell Shaanxi Changjiang's entire 60% interest in Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., ("East Mining" and formerly referred to as "Dongfang Mining") for a total consideration of $885,696 (RMB 5,400,000). The consideration payable to the Company was used to offset amounts owed to each of the acquirers. Each of the acquirers obtained 30% equity in this transaction.


	 


	We also hold land use rights in a land parcel and we lease a portion of the land use rights on the 5.7 square kilometer parcel to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd (previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.), a company with a common control person. The term of the lease agreement is from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2029. Our land use rights are amortized over their 50-year term. The Land use right was our largest asset, with an annual rent of approximately $1.2 million (RMB 7, 500,000).


	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we only received rent payment of 2011 and no collection afterwards. Due to the uncertain collectability, we decided to write off all the receivable related to land lease of $3,618,818 (equivalent to RMB 22,500,000) and decided not to recognize any revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, and for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

	The following is a summary of the book value of our land use rights as of March 31, 2017:

	Amortization expenses were $92,907 and $97,861 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 


	As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $8,054,012 as of March 31, 2017, which includes net loss for common stockholders of $127,218 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company’s operations used cash of $30,060 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	In the past, the Company relied on the loan received from the related parties, and cash generated from operations to meet its operating requirements. Although the Company was successful in the past in obtaining financing, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financings will still be favorable. However, in the event that we have insufficient cash to meet our operating requirements, our related companies and shareholders will commit to provide loan to maintain liquidity.


	 


	We believe that we have adequate capital to assure that we will be able to meet our obligations or obtain sufficient capital to complete our plan of operations for the next twelve (12) months.

	Sales revenue




	 


	We did not recognize land use right leasing revenue and solar PV energy revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, due to uncertainty of collectability.


	  




	Operating Expenses




	 


	Total operating expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $133,990 compared with operating expense of $138,529 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing a decrease of $4,539 or 3%. Administrative expense increased by $1,795 or 6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The amortization expense decreased by $4,954 or 5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to depreciation of RMB against USD, in spite of the fact that no addition or disposal occurred for land use rights. The depreciation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $1,380 or 16%, compared with the same period of 2016, which was mainly due to full depreciation provided for some fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	Loss from operation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $133,990, compared to loss from operation of $138,529 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 


	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements.


	 


	An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions which are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and affect our financial condition and results of operations.

	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, both significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred or services have been rendered and accepted, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.


	 


	We are currently leasing the land use right to Huanghe for the development and operation of a theme park. We generally collect the annual rent every year, and then recognize land use right leasing revenue over the beneficial period described by the agreement, as the revenue is realized or realizable and earned.


	 


	The Company supplied electricity power by its solar PV energy segment. The electricity revenue is earned and recognized upon transmission of electricity to Heyang County Huanghe Bay Resort Hotel Co., Ltd., a related company or the power grid controlled and owned by the respective regional or provincial grid companies. The Company stopped providing such service since 2017.

	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 


	In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2017. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.


	 


	Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2017.


	 



	Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures



	 


	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls



	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
