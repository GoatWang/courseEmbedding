Sources: Invesco, FactSet Research Systems, Inc., Lipper, Inc., Zephyr StyleADVISOR. Invesco Core Plus Bond Fund is based on Class A Shares at NAV. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Index performance is from May 31, 2009, the month-end closest to fund inception.
Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Click the performance tab for the most recent month-end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Investment return and principal value will vary so that you many have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Class A share performance reflects any applicable fee waivers or expense reimbursements. Performance shown at NAV does not include maximum applicable 4.25% front-end sales charge, which would have reduced performance. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.

 Additional information

Historically, the fund has had a low correlation of 0.17 to stocks, as measured by the S&P 500. Data from June 3, 2009 to March 31, 2017. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Active Trading Risk. Active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses, a lower return and increased tax liability.
Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the completion of the FRB's quantitative easing program and the “tapering” of other similar foreign central bank actions. This eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility, political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. Investments in high yield debt securities (“junk bonds”) and other lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal when due, are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile.
Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in such investments. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities, including collateralized debt obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations, are subject to prepayment or call risk, which is the risk that a borrower's payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans. This could result in the Fund reinvesting these early payments at lower interest rates, thereby reducing the Fund's income. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities also are subject to extension risk, which is the risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments, causing the price of the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and the Fund's share price to fall. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgage-backed securities and could result in losses to the Fund. The Fund may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages, which are loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages. Privately issued mortgage-related securities are not subject to the same underwriting requirements as those with government or government-sponsored entity guarantee and, therefore, mortgage loans underlying privately issued mortgage-related securities may have less favorable collateral, credit risk or other underwriting characteristics, and wider variances in interest rate, term, size, purpose and borrower characteristics.
Municipal Securities Risk. The risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer. Constitutional amendments, legislative enactments, executive orders, administrative regulations, voter initiatives, and the issuer's regional economic conditions may affect the municipal security's value, interest payments, repayment of principal and the Fund's ability to sell the security. Failure of a municipal security issuer to comply with applicable tax requirements may make income paid thereon taxable, resulting in a decline in the security's value. In addition, there could be changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of municipal securities.
TBA Transactions Risk. TBA transactions involve the risk of loss if the securities received are less favorable than what was anticipated by the Fund when entering into the TBA transaction, or if the counterparty fails to deliver the securities. When the Fund enters into a short sale of a TBA mortgage it does not own, the Fund may have to purchase deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale at a higher price than anticipated, thereby causing a loss. As there is no limit on how much the price of mortgage securities can increase, the Fund's exposure is unlimited. The Fund may not always be able to purchase mortgage securities to close out the short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price. In addition, taking short positions results in a form of leverage, which could increase the volatility of the Fund's share price.
U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which could affect the Fund's ability to recover should they default. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.
When-Issued, Delayed Delivery and Forward Commitment Risks. When-issued and delayed delivery transactions subject the Fund to market risk because the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or yield generally available when delivery occurs, and counterparty risk because the Fund relies on the buyer or seller, as the case may be, to consummate the transaction. These transactions also have a leveraging effect on the Fund because the Fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to pay for until a later date, which increases the Fund's overall investment exposure and, as a result, its volatility.
Zero Coupon or Pay-In-Kind Securities Risk. The value, interest rates, and liquidity of non-cash paying instruments, such as zero coupon and pay-in-kind securities, are subject to greater fluctuation than other types of securities. The higher yields and interest rates on pay-in-kind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than loans that periodically pay interest.

Overview 












		    	Investment
		    	
		    	Overview









The Western Asset Core Plus Portfolios consist of investments in individual securities and shares of no-fee mutual funds advised by Western Asset and its affiliates. The no-fee funds are used by Western Asset to achieve appropriate levels of diversification, as well as provide clients with exposure to sectors that are normally difficult to include in a separately managed account with low minimum investment requirements.
 









		    	Investment
		    	
		    	Philosophy









Long-term

Seek out the greatest long-term value by thoroughly analyzing a wide range of sectors of the fixed income market.

Value-oriented

Identify and favor sectors and issuers that are undervalued or out of favor in the market.

Diversified strategies

Results do not depend on only one or two opportunities; multiple themes are employed in portfolios. Diversification seeks to limit the impact of a single adverse market event.
Strive to add incremental value over time and potentially reduce volatility

Sector rotation

The Core Plus Portfolios predominantly focus on investment-grade securities across all market sectors and maturities, as well as other alternatives such as high-yield bonds, emerging markets debt, and non-dollar bonds.

 









		    	Key
		    	
		    	Differentiators









Unique structure

Utilizes an institutional-style hybrid approach for the strategy that combines individual securities and no-fee funds into one account.
Provides access within the fixed income market to a greater number of sectors, with more diversification in each sector than a traditional separately managed account with a similar minimum account size.
Increases the diversification within each sector, which may achieve lower volatility and higher returns than a traditional managed account with this minimum account size.

Leverage Western Asset Management resources

Institutional-caliber buying power and trading expertise
Access to proprietary credit research team 
Exclusive focus on fixed income management

 





The Core Plus portfolios are available as separately managed accounts that utilize both individual securities and no-fee mutual funds. These mutual funds were created specifically for, and are made available exclusively through, these separately managed accounts. The fund’s prospectus is available from your financial professional and includes information on fund investment objectives, strategies and risks, including the heightened risks associated with investments in high-yield securities, also known as “junk bonds.” High-yield bonds are subject to increased risk of default and greater volatility due to the lower credit quality of the issues.
Shares of the no-fee funds may only be purchased by or on behalf of separately managed accounts by Legg Mason affiliates, including Western Asset. Managed account clients will pay fees to program sponsors or to their account managers, and such fees will be calculated taking into account assets invested in shares of no-fee funds. Unless reimbursed by the fund's manager or its affiliates, ordinary and extraordinary fund-level operating expenses are borne by shareholders. The manager of the no-fee funds has entered into an expense reimbursement agreement with the funds pursuant to which the manager has agreed to reimburse 100% of each fund's ordinary operating expenses through December 31, 2017. The expense reimbursement agreement does not cover brokerage, taxes and extraordinary expenses.
There is no guarantee that the Portfolio's objectives will be met.




 
 






Investment
					 Process
















Interest rate exposure/duration weighting


The investment team comprehensively analyzes a variety of domestic and international macroeconomic factors to establish a duration target.
















Term structure weighting


The Firm carefully employs strategies in an attempt to take advantage of changes in the yield curve’s shape and shifts in the relationship between short-, intermediate- and long-maturity securities.
















Sector allocation


We believe that value can be added to a portfolio by actively rotating among, and within, different sectors of the bond market. The investment team studies the fundamental factors that influence sector spread relationships.
















Issue selection


Using a bottom-up process, the Firm seeks to identify companies with changing credit characteristics and securities that are undervalued and out of favor due to unusual circumstances.
















The investment process may change over time. The characteristics set forth above are intended as a general illustration of some of the criteria the strategy team considers in selecting securities for client portfolios. There is no guarantee investment objectives will be achieved.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments involve risk, including loss of principal and there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met.  Fixed income securities may be subject to extension risk, which is the risk that the issuer will repay their obligations more slowly than the market anticipates in the event market interest rates rise. Issuers also have the right to pay their payment obligations ahead of schedule in the event market interest rates fall, subjecting to prepayment risk.  Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk, which is a possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and repay the principal on its debt. As interest rates rise, the price of fixed income securities falls.  Foreign securities, where permitted, are subject to the additional risks of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in political and economic conditions, foreign taxation, and differences in auditing and financial standards. These risks are magnified in the case of investments in emerging markets.  U.S. Treasuries are direct debt obligations issued and backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantees the principal and interest payments on U.S. Treasuries when the securities are held to maturity. Unlike U.S. Treasury securities, debt securities issued by the federal agencies and instrumentalities and related investments may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  Even when the U.S. government guarantees principal and interest payments on securities, this guarantee does not apply to losses resulting from declines in the market value of these securities.  Investments may also be made in mortgage-backed, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal securities. Asset-backed securities generally decrease in value as a result of interest rate increases, but may benefit less than other fixed-income securities from declining interest rates, principally because of prepayments. Mortgage-backed securities involve additional risk over more traditional fixed-income investments, including: interest rate risk, implied call and extension risks; and the possibility of premature return of principal due to mortgage prepayment, which can reduce expected yield and lead to price volatility.  Investments may also be made in taxable municipal securities.

Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSRO"): Standard and Poor's ("S&P"), Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), Fitch Ratings, Ltd. In the event a portfolio security is rated by more than one NRSRO, the higher rating is shown. In the case where a security is not rated by an NRSRO, these are listed as "Non Rated". The credit quality of the investments in the Portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Portfolio. These ratings may change over time. The Portfolio itself has not been rated by a NRSRO.

Western Asset claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. Western Asset has been independently verified for the periods from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2015. The verification report is available upon request.  

Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. The verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
For GIPS® purposes, the Firm is defined as Western Asset, a primarily fixed-income investment manager comprised of Western Asset Management Company, Western Asset Management Company Limited, Western Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd., Western Asset Management Company Ltd., Western Asset Management Company Pty Ltd., and Western Asset Management Company Distribuidora de Títulos e Valores Mobiliários (DTVM) Limitada, with offices in Pasadena, New York, London, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne, São Paulo, Hong Kong, and Dubai. Each Western Asset company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc. (“Legg Mason”) but operates autonomously, and Western Asset, as a firm, is held out to the public as a separate entity. Western Asset Management Company was founded in 1971. The Firm is comprised of several entities as a result of various historical acquisitions made by Western Asset and their respective performance has been integrated into the Firm in line with the portability requirements set forth by GIPS.
Effective April 2007, Western Asset manages these portfolios as sub-advisor to its affiliate, Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group, LLC. From January 2006 through March 2007, Western Asset portfolio managers managed these portfolios as dual employees of ClearBridge Advisors, LLC, and ClearBridge Asset Management Inc. (each a Western Asset affiliate), following Western Asset’s investment process and having access to Western Asset’s investment resources, expertise and investment outlook. 
Western Asset – Core Plus portfolios are discretionary fixed-income portfolios that offer – to individual and taxable institutional investors – tailored bond management which seeks to maximize total return and has the flexibility to invest across a range of fixed-income sectors, including the U.S. government, federal agency, domestic corporate, mortgage, non-U.S. sovereign and corporate (both U.S. dollar-denominated and non-U.S. dollar-denominated), emerging market debt, high yield and money market/cash equivalent sectors. Exposure to certain fixed income sectors represented in the strategy are achieved by investing in shares of one or more mutual funds managed by Western Asset. The composite is comprised of accounts that are separately managed accounts (SMAs), managed in accordance with the strategy with an account minimum of US $150,000 (prior to 11/1/2014, the composite minimum was US $250,000).  As of January 1, 2007, the composite employs a 10% significant cash flow policy. The composite was created on January 1, 2007.
Effective January 1, 2013, the number of portfolios reflects a change from prior periods due to an aggregation of accounts as reported by one sponsor. For periods prior to 2013, the firm excluded accounts designated by the sponsor as client-restricted. 
For comparison purposes, composite returns are shown against returns of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.  An investor cannot invest directly in an index.
1“Pure” gross returns are presented as supplemental information to the net returns. The current fee schedule is 1.50% on all assets. Net returns are calculated by deducting the anticipated maximum annual bundled fee applied on a monthly basis from the "pure" gross monthly return. The bundled fee includes all charges for trading costs, portfolio management, custody, and other administrative fees. Bundled fees may vary across different financial firms and across different accounts based upon account size and other factors. Returns and market values are expressed in USD. 
Dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of annual returns of those portfolios that were included in the composite for the entire year (equal-weighted prior to 2014). Periods with five or fewer accounts are not statistically representative and are not presented. The three-year annualized ex-post standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period. Standard deviation is not presented for periods where 36 monthly returns are not available for the composite or the benchmark.
Past investment results are not indicative of future investment results.
Western Asset’s list of composite descriptions and policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request. Please contact Ellen Cammer at 212-601-6064 or Ellen.Cammer@westernasset.com. 






All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s webpage for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information.

Core Plus









Share








































What does 'Core Plus' mean
Core plus is a fixed-income investment management style that permits managers to add instruments with greater risk and greater potential return - high-yield, global and emerging market debt, for example - to core portfolios of investment-grade bonds. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Core Plus'
Investment advisors will advocate building portfolios with core holdings that consist of securities and/or mutual funds that reflect market positions and performance prospects that are so strong that these holdings may be maintained in the portfolio virtually forever. Such holdings might represent as much as 75% of the portfolio. The remaining balance would then consist of higher risk holdings, which may have shorter investment horizons than the core component of the portfolio. As such, a portfolio's core investments would represent a solid foundation to which more aggressive, diversified investments could be added. With mutual funds, the core designation is used to describe categories of large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, multi-cap and international funds that represent a blend of stocks in the value and growth investment styles.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. There is no guarantee the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved. Prices of equity securities may change significantly over short or extended periods of time. The Fund sells securities that it has borrowed but does not own (“short sales”), which is a speculative technique. The Fund will suffer a loss when the price of a security that it holds long decreases or the price of a security that it has sold short increases. Losses on short sales arise from increases in the value of the security sold short, and therefore are theoretically unlimited. Because the Fund invests in both long and short equity positions, the Fund has overall exposure to changes in value of equity securities that is far greater than its net asset value. This may magnify gains and losses and increase the volatility of the Fund’s returns. In addition, the use of short sales will increase the Fund’s expenses. More information on these risks considerations, as well as information on other risks to which the Fund is subject, such as frequent trading, futures contract, and large cap stock risks, are included in the Fund’s prospectus.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.

We've made it our business to keep your costs low

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

Layer opened.Expense ratio







A mutual fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets. It's calculated annually and removed from the fund's earnings before they're distributed to investors, directly reducing investors' returns.An expense ratio includes management, administrative, marketing, and distribution fees. It doesn't include loads or purchase or redemption fees.

footnote*Vanguard average mutual fund expense ratio: 0.12%. Industry average expense ratio: 0.69%. All averages are asset-weighted. Industry averages exclude Vanguard. Sources: Vanguard and Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2016.
footnote**For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 9 of 9 Vanguard money market funds, 51 of 54 Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds, and 99 of 107 Vanguard stock funds—for a total of 182 of 193 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer-group average. Results will vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds with a minimum 10-year history were included in the comparison. Source: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company. The competitive performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. View fund performance
footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.
