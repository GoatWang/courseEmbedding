TC PipeLines, LP is a United States limited partnership with a long history of stable and growing cash distributions which has delivered value to its investors while maintaining a solid cash distribution coverage ratio.
Through its disciplined investment philosophy, TC PipeLines now has investments in eight critical FERC regulated, low-risk energy infrastructure pipelines, capable of moving 9.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Revenues from these assets are derived almost entirely from fee-based charges.
With access to new gas supplies through support from its sponsor, TransCanada Corporation, who also operates our assets on our behalf, TC PipeLines’ assets are connected to two of the largest supply basins in North America that are positioned to grow over the next decade.
With a strong and conservative balance sheet, a low general partner cash take and an ample amount of available liquidity, we are well positioned for growth.

This information is historical and cannot be used to make predictions on future distributions from the Partnership.












Future dates are tentative - for informational purposes only










(1)The Partnership's initial cash distribution was 16.81 cents per unit. This distribution reflected the shortened period of May 28 to June 30, 1999. The target distribution level (the Minimum Quarterly Distribution) for a full three-month period was set at 45 cents in TC PipeLines' May 24, 1999 initial public offering prospectus. The prospectus also stated that the initial distribution of the Partnership would be adjusted to reflect the actual number of days from the closing of the offering to the end of the quarter. The initial cash distribution of 16.81 cents per unit was calculated as follows:

Date offering closed: May 28, 1999
End of initial quarter: June 30, 1999
Number of days from closing to quarter end: 34
Number of days in full three-month quarter: 91
Minimum Quarterly Distribution: 45 cents
34 days divided by 91 days multiplied by 45 cents = 16.81 cents 







 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cash Distribution Policy















The holder of the general partner interest is entitled to receive 2 percent of total cash distributions until the MQD has been achieved, at which time it will have the right to receive incentive distributions. Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash after the MQD has been achieved.







The Partnership expects to make cash distributions approximately 45 days after the end of each quarter. There is no assurance, however, that the MQD will be made on the common units.
A detailed description of TC PipeLines, LP's cash distribution policy is in the May 24, 1999 initial public offering prospectus.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
