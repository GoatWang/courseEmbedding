PWA Wealth Management

	PWA Wealth Management employs a process designed to match the clients' investment portfolio with the specific needs for cash flow now and in the future.  We balance the relationship between risk and reward in every decision we make.  We believe that market volatility is normal, therefore, the appropriate mix of growth and safety is essential.  Investors should avoid experiencing significant market downturns.  Our goal is to assist you in achieving that objective.


	Developed over decades, the PWA Wealth Management investment philosophy delivers growth with protection.  Growth is predominately generated by investing in the equity markets and is essential for long term capital preservation.  Retirees must recognize that retirement often lasts for 30 years or more and their portfolios must continue to grow or risk the loss of purchasing power.


	At PWA Wealth Management, we deliver the care you deserve.

Financial Investments



	PWA Wealth Management has access to the full spectrum of financial investments. Our approach is to keep things transparent and simple. Mutual Funds, Exchange Traded Funds, Common Stocks, and Individual Bonds are the primary means used when building portfolios. In addition, equity and index options, futures, and alternative investments may be used in specific situations.


	As an independent wealth management firm, we have access to the universe of investment products from which we select only those investments that appropriately meet our clients’ objectives. We select our investments based on a variety of criteria which include overall cost and performance. The objective is to keep costs low and performance high.


	Mutual Funds


	PWA Wealth Management screens the expansive universe of funds for low-cost funds with historical track records of strong performance. Our professionals engage fund managers regularly and we continuously monitor those funds that we are invested in for performance, allocation, and other changes. Each quarter we examine the funds' activities to determine if it should be included in our fund offerings.


	Exchange Traded Funds (ETFS)


	PWA Wealth Management believes that Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offer a low cost and tax efficient means of building a portfolio. ETFs may be used as a core holding and are extremely useful as a diversification tool. An ETF is a bundle of securities (stocks or bonds) that provide broad market exposure. ETFs may be passively or actively managed and can be either highly focused or broadly diversified. Due to the breadth of offerings, these vehicles provide a direct means of targeting virtually any sector of the market within which we choose to gain exposure.


	Common Stocks


	Worldwide equity market performance simply represents the blended performance of all common stocks. To gain exposure to the best companies, we choose to own the individual common stocks. We focus on companies with strong balance sheets, good cash flows, consistent track records, and solid management. Economic activities, market valuations, dividend payments, current and future business trends and the legal environment are all considered when choosing individual companies.


	Individual Bonds


	When selecting individual bonds, liquidity, yield, ratings, maturity and taxability are all factors used in making purchase decisions. Our objective is to capture the highest yield at the lowest risk with the lowest tax consequence for our clients.

About Us


Brickell Square Advisors is a client-centric, independent financial services firm. Client relationships based on integrity, professionalism, understanding and mutual respect are the foundation upon which the firm is built. Our dedicated client focus is a commitment that we will always act in the client’s best interests.

Helping our clients financially is only part of our goal. Investment returns are only one half of the equation. With greater return expectations comes greater investment risk. Our goal is to manage our clients’ likelihood of success while also managing their exposure to investment risk. To do this, we maintain a strict focus on our clients’ needs and goals; build investment portfolios tailored specifically to their needs and tolerance for risk; utilize unique asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing techniques to further reduce investment risk; and invest for the long term.
Wealth planning and management is a long-term, dynamic endeavor. Successful advisor/client relationships are built around a commitment to a long-term financial plan. We utilize sophisticated tools designed to assist clients in reaching lifetime financial goals, regardless of short-term fluctuations in the financial markets.
We believe in collaboration. When seeking outside resources to serve our clients’ needs, we look for partners that not only are acknowledged experts in their fields, but also share our vision and values. We have teamed with top-tiered firms that provide access to complex estate planning solutions; tax and accounting services; independent, conflict-free, capital markets research; portfolio design strategies and investment vehicles – all for the benefit our clients.
The Value of Independence
Unlike many of our competitors, Brickell Square Advisors is an independent financial services firm. Independence means we are neither required nor additionally compensated to sell a Broker/Dealer’s proprietary products or use its research. Therefore, independence eliminates this conflict of interest when recommending particular investments and strategies. Independence gives us the opportunity to offer what we believe to be the best investment vehicles and strategies for our clients. It gives us the flexibility to seek specific solutions from among a larger universe of investment options, and the freedom to create strategic alliances to provide services that might otherwise be unavailable. Independence, we believe, is critical to helping clients objectively reach their goals.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
