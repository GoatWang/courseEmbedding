Job Details
               First Presbyterian School was founded in 1995, in the city of Arcadia, a suburb of Los Angeles that lies in the shadow of the San Gabriel mountain range. Classes began on September 13, 1995, in a large office suite in a two story commercial building. The first class to graduate from First Presbyterian School did so in June 1998. In 2005, the growth of the school required expansion. As a result, the school relocated to the First Baptist Church of Alhambra in Alhambra, CA in September of 2009. First Presbyterian School focuses primarily on college preparatory education for students from overseas, the majority of whom are from China. Throughout its history, the schoolï¿½s program has successfully prepared students for entrance into various colleges and universities throughout the United States.
