Bio
John W. Zerr is an Intellectual Property attorney who has a strong background in the preparation and prosecution of patent applications across a wide variety of mechanically related fields including medical devices, railway technology, tooling and manufacturing, mining, industrial, construction and agricultural machinery, and also design patents. Prior to joining The Webb Law Firm, where he is involved with patents, trademarks, and copyrights on a daily basis, he served at a local law firm as a summer intern with responsibility for prosecution of patent applications related to the computer technology, electrical, business methods, and mechanical fields. Earlier, as a patent intern with a large corporation specializing in the manufacturing of tooling for the metalworking, coal and construction industries, he formulated and implemented patent prosecution strategies for U.S. patent applications. Before attending law school, he was a Patent Examiner with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office where he examined patent applications in several mechanically related fields. He also was an engineering intern with the Werner Company, a well-known climbing equipment manufacturer, where he helped to develop new products, analyze material investments and enhance productivity.

Description
If brethren somehow could be made acquainted with Brother Zerr’s Bible Commentary, it is possible that it could be as widely used as has been Johnson’s Notes, first published in 1889. Brother Zerr printed very little of the Bible text in his commentary. He assumed you would have your own Bible nearby. To have printed in the commentary the entire Bible would have required at least three other volumes. While it would have been helpful to have the Bible text printed by the comments, this unnecessary luxury would have been very expensive, since we all have copies of the Scriptures already. Furthermore, Brother Zerr intended that one be compelled to use his Bible, in order that his commentary never supplant the Sacred text. Volume IV covers Jeremiah to Malachi.
