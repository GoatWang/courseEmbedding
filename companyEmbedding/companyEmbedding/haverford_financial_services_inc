Investment Philosophy
Haverford, comprised of Haverford Financial Services and The Haverford Trust Company, provides investment management services based on our Quality Investing approach. Refined over three decades, Haverford’s Quality Investing strategy is committed to maximizing returns while minimizing risk throughout the entire market cycle. Quality Investing focuses on A-rated equities that deliver consistent earnings and dividend growth, and investment grade fixed income securities that seek to protect both principal and income over the long term.
Haverford’s Philosophy Has Never Changed
We believe the clients’ interests are best served by applying a unified, disciplined investment approach that is consistent over time. Haverford takes pride in the fact that our investment philosophy has not changed in the history of the firm.
Our Quality Growth Portfolio is founded on our belief that:

High-quality companies provide superior returns with less risk
Dividend-paying companies provide superior returns with less risk
Stock prices follow earnings
Unnecessary portfolio turnover destroys value
Appropriate diversification lowers risk

Haverford’s primary investment goals are to generate premium returns over full market cycles, protect the purchasing power and principal of our clients’ portfolios, and minimize risk during difficult times.
From our original focus on large-cap growth equities, we have applied the Quality Investing strategy to additional diversification options including fixed income strategies, socially-responsible investing, this mutual fund and the Haverford Quality 250TM, a fundamentally-weighted portfolio of quality companies.


        Mutual fund investing involves risk, including loss of principal.

Fund Family Overview
Haverford Financial Services provides investment management services based on Haverford’s Quality Investing strategy. The Haverford Quality Growth Stock Fund is a mutual fund based on that same Quality Investing strategy. Made up of generally the same stocks as regular Haverford portfolio accounts, the Fund typically contains between 25 and 35 companies diversified across a variety of economic sectors and industry groups. 
To be considered for inclusion in the fund, each security must exhibit:

Financial strength and stability
Consistent and predictable earnings and dividend growth
Industry leadership
Large market capitalization
U.S. exchange listed

The desired result for investors in the Fund is stability and reduced volatility, with upside potential. It is important to note that because of Haverford's focus on long-term fundamentals, the Quality Growth Stock Fund enjoys relatively low portfolio turnover (10-20%) and an efficient tax structure.
We recommend a minimum of three to five year time horizon for investments in the Fund.

Haverford Quality Growth Stock Fund

Investors who seek long-term growth of capital and income and are willing to bear the risk of investing in equity securities.
The Fund seeks long term growth of capital by investing in well-known and established stocks with continued earnings and a history of paying dividends.


        The Haverford Quality Growth Stock Fund is/are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO) is not affiliated with The Haverford Trust Company or any other affiliate. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA’s Brokercheck .

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Mondelez International (NYSE:KFT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
