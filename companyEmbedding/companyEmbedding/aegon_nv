Products

Aegon's innovations have one thing in common. They make our products, services, processes and methods of distribution more convenient and easier to use for our customers.



Product Development
To ensure our products and services meet or exceed customer requirements, our new innovations are often developed directly with customers. For example, our customers told us they want to be able to buy and service their products online. By 2016, online sales accounted for 16% of our total sales.
 Learn more about the factors that are shaping our future products 
Our Pricing and Product Development Policy also ensures that new products and services meet the specific needs of our customers and stakeholders, including pricing.
Dedicated product-development and approval teams assess new products for possible risks and benefits, and ensure that products comply with local regulations.
Any new product or service has to be signed off by the CEO in the country where it will be sold.

The most important products are discussed below.  Fund plan and savings plan products. Fund plan and savings plan products are mainly endowment and savings type products, both single premium and recurring
premiums with profit sharing based on the selected fund performance. A customer may choose from a wide variety of AEGON funds. AEGON The Netherlands has issued a guarantee of 3% for investments in the Mix Fund and the Fixed Income Fund (4% on
policies sold before the end of 1999) at the maturity date if the policyholder has paid the premium for a consecutive period of at least ten years or on death of the insured.

Endowment and savings products. Endowment and savings products have recurring premiums with contractual
surplus interest profit sharing.  Mortgage savings products. AEGON The Netherlands provides mortgage loans to customers for a period of
twenty or thirty years. The loan is repaid in full or in part at the redemption date with the proceeds from a savings policy. If the insured dies within the policy contract period, the benefit payment is used to repay the mortgage loan. The interest
paid on the loan is normally tax deductible, and the customer retains the full income tax benefit over the contract period so long as there is no early redemption. The interest paid on the mortgage loan usually equals the interest accumulated on the
account balance under the savings policy. In case of surrender, the policyholder loses the tax benefit.  At the end of 2004 AEGON The Netherlands
introduced AEGON LevenHypotheek, a universal life-based mortgage investment product. The loan is repaid in full or in part at the redemption date with the proceeds from a savings policy. If the insured dies during the contract period, the benefit
payment is used to repay the mortgage loan. The customer can choose from six funds in which to invest the savings premiums; two of these six funds offer limited guaranteed benefit payments on maturity date. The actual amount available at the
maturity date will vary depending on the performance of the underlying funds.  Spaarbeleg Kas N.V. and AEGON Spaarkas N.V. sell life products with both
single and recurring premiums and profit-sharing based on a specific bonus system (tontine system). The main characteristic of a tontine system is that when the policyholder dies, the balance is not paid out to the policyholders estate, but is
distributed at the end of the year to the surviving policyholders of the specific series (a new series starts at the beginning of each calendar year) to which the deceased policyholder belonged. When the policyholder dies before maturity, AEGON The
Netherlands pays a death benefit equal to the premiums paid accumulated at a 4% compound interest, subject to a minimum of 110% of the fund value during the first half of the contract term. In addition to the tontine products, Spaarbeleg Kas N.V.
sells a number of tax-driven products, and the seller has provided better access to products and services in order to meet consumers requests with respect to pension issues.  This excerpt taken from the AEG 20-F filed Mar 31, 2005.Life Insurance Products    The life insurance products are mainly sold by the marketing and sales organization Intermediary and by AEGON Spaarbeleg. The products are predominantly standard
financial products; the most important products are discussed below.    Fund Plan and Savings Plan Products. Fund plan and savings plan products are mainly endowment and savings type products, both single premium and recurring premiums with profit sharing based on the selected fund performance. A

Endowment and savings products have recurring premiums with contractual surplus interest profit sharing.    Mortgage Savings Products. AEGON The Netherlands provides mortgage loans to customers for a period of twenty or thirty years.
The loan is repaid at the redemption date with, fully or partly, the proceeds from a savings policy. Upon the death of the insured within the policy contract period, the benefit payment is used to repay the mortgage loan. The interest paid on the
loan is normally tax deductible and the customer retains the full income tax benefit over the contract period so long as there is no early redemption. The interest paid on the mortgage loan usually equals the interest accumulated on the account
balance under the savings policy. In case of surrender the policyholder loses the tax benefit.    In October 2004 AEGON The Netherlands introduced AEGON LevenHypotheek, a universal life-based mortgage investment product. The loan is repaid at the redemption date, in full or in part with the proceeds from a savings
policy. Upon the death of the insured within the policy contract period, the benefit payment is used to repay the mortgage loan. The customer can choose from six funds in which to invest the savings premiums; two of these six funds offer limited

(a new series starts at the beginning of each calendar year) to which the deceased policyholder belonged. In addition to the tontine products, Spaarbeleg Kas N.V. sells a number of tax-driven products and has provided better access to products and
services in order to meet consumers requests with respect to pension issues.    EXCERPTS ON THIS PAGE:20-FMar 30, 200620-FMar 31, 2005RELATED TOPICS for AEG:Non-life ProductsPension ProductsVIEW MORE

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWAEG » Topics » Institutional productsThis excerpt taken from the AEG 20-F filed Mar 31, 2009.Institutional products  Operating earnings before tax from
institutional products decreased by 4% in 2007 to USD 464 million. During the year, the decrease in the value of certain structured products more than offset the solid underlying growth of the business and the inclusion for the first time of Clark
Inc., a distributor of bank-owned and corporate-owned life insurance. Overall earnings in both 2007 and 2006 reflect the strong outperformance of AEGON hedge fund and other fair value investments.  This excerpt taken from the AEG 20-F filed Mar 28, 2008.Institutional products  Operating earnings before tax of
institutional products increased 3% to USD 480 million compared to 2005. Higher earnings on certain assets carried at fair value, which amounted to USD 171 million compared to USD 88 million in 2005, growth due to strong sales as well
as increased fees from growth in synthetic GICs and other assets under management were offset by reduced product spreads due to the continued rise of short-term interest rates early in 2006.  This excerpt taken from the AEG 6-K filed Mar 7, 2008.Institutional products  Sales of
institutional guaranteed spread-based products totaled USD 1,342 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of USD 1,269 million, or 49%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales of institutional fee-based products totaled USD
4,430 million, down from a strong fourth quarter of 2006 of USD 7,134 million. Sales of BOLI/COLI products increased 73% to USD 90 million, including a large single premium sale.  This excerpt taken from the AEG 6-K filed Nov 9, 2007.Institutional
products  Sales of institutional guaranteed spread-based products totaled USD 3.6 billion during the third quarter, an increase of USD
445 million, or 14%, compared with the third quarter of 2006. Sales of institutional fee-based products reached USD 6.0 billion, up from USD 1.6 billion during third quarter 2006. The institutional business captured some temporary
opportunities, offered by the dislocation of financial markets during the third quarter, which led to extraordinary high new business activity. Sales of BOLI/COLI products decreased USD 74 million to USD 40 million.  This excerpt taken from the AEG 6-K filed Sep 27, 2007.Institutional products  Institutional guaranteed products sales in the first six months of 2007 of USD 16,725 million, were 57% higher than sales in the same period last year. Sales of on balance sheet guaranteed spread-based products were USD
8,985 million for the first six months of 2007, an increase of USD 2,216 million, or 33%, compared to results for the first six months 2006. The increase was due to higher issuance of medium term notes from the US and Ireland platforms.
Sales of off balance sheet fee-based products were USD 7,740 million in the first six months of 2007 compared to USD 3,895 million in the first six months of 2006.  Standardized life production of BOLI/COLI products increased to USD 78 million in the first six months of 2007 from USD 35 million in the first six months of 2006. Sales during the first six months of 2007
include two significant single premium cases totaling USD 400 million.  Operating earnings before tax of USD 250 million for the first six months of
2007 increased USD 20 million or 9% compared to the results for the first six months of 2006. The total over performance of the fair value items in the first six months of 2007 was up USD 18 million compared to the performance in the first
six months of 2006 due mostly to the strong hedge funds results in the first six months of 2007. The remaining increase in operating earnings for the period is primarily due to the strong organic business growth compared to the first six months of
2006, partially offset by lower spreads.  This excerpt taken from the AEG 6-K filed Sep 12, 2007.Institutional products  Institutional products operating earnings before tax of USD 464 million decreased USD 78 million or 14% compared to the results for 2004. The valuation of
certain financial assets carried at fair value contributed USD 88 million to operating earnings before tax in 2005 compared to USD 96 million in 2004. Excluding this item, operating earnings decreased USD 70 million. The decrease includes
USD 16 million from the one-time positive effect in 2004 related to the performance of a portfolio of loans together with lower investment spreads due to rising short-term interest rates. These items were partially offset by a positive DPAC
adjustment in the Bank-Owned Life Insurance and Company-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI/COLI) business in the first quarter of 2005 and the impact of business growth.

AEGON NV: It's Closing Time For This Preferred Stock - AEGON NV (NYSE:AEG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AEGON NV: It's Closing Time For This Preferred StockMar.28.17 | About: AEGON NV (AEG) Arbitrage Trader Arbitrage, debt, bonds, short-term horizonMarketplaceTrade With BetaSummaryAEB has reached levels where the upside potential is limited by its fundamentals.Floating Rate preferred stocks have had a good year so far, but at some point it is wise to cash in.There are other options similar to this product which will provide you with better current yield and have plenty of room before reaching par value.This article will be rather unusual, as we are not going to explore any sort of arbitrage, but I will instead try to raise awareness about one particular stock in which it is time to head for the exit. The Stock The product in question is AEGON NV (NYSE:AEG) Floating Rate Perpetual Capital Securities (AEB). Below are some key parameters we should pay attention to:  Nominal Yield: 4% (4% or 0.875% plus the three-month LIBOR, whichever is greater and the latter is adjusted on a quarterly basis) Current Yield: 4% (as of 3/27/2017) Liquidation Price: $25.00 Call Price: $25.00 Call Date: 12/15/2010 Maturity Date: None Rating: Baa1/BBB (rated 3/24/16) It is eligible for the 15% tax rate.  Given that this week the LIBOR rating we should be paying attention to is hovering around 1.16%, it takes no genius to realize investors will not be seeing yield better than the nominal for a while, unless something crazy happens. That being said, anyone not trading actively needs to know that on 3/27/2017 this preferred stock traded on par value, and there is no reason for it to trade above that. In fact, if it does continue going up, you are going to be exposed to a potential call of the whole issue, and the yield does not justify this risk. 

 Source: Lightspeed Trader. AEB - weekly chart. I decided to include a chart to further emphasize on the downside risk if you keep holding the stock. The movement observed through 2013 was ignited by the rate hike, so you can imagine rates are another factor to take into consideration, albeit with LIBOR crawling up as well.
 The Peer Group 

 Source: The author's database. As you can see in the table above, there are many other investment opportunities in the Floating Rate space that provide us with about the same, or even better, current yield than AEB. However, one thing to take into consideration is the fact that a majority of them are trading below par. What does this mean? Firstly, I doubt that anyone whose investment criteria includes current yield is a fan of LIBOR-tracking preferred stocks. The rates have been so low that all these products have utilized their fixed-rate minimum yields for years now and have yet to take LIBOR into account. And it is still far below the levels where it will have an actual impact. Secondly, you have to look at the price relative to par if you plan on holding any stock from this group long-term, because, although it might sound speculative, it is wise to consider the possibility of a call. All in all, anyone who has been following my articles over the last few months is familiar with my approach. I do not consider them as an investment vehicle, but prefer pair trading them whenever there is a mispricing. My past articles on the topic reveal my methodology, so you can be prepared in case AEB shrugs off all fundamentals and proceeds going up. Conclusion I believe anyone who has AEGON NV Floating Rate Perpetual Capital Securities (AEB) in his portfolio should reap the fruits of his investment and head for the exit, as there is limited to no upside potential at this point, given the pace at which LIBOR has been moving upward. There are a whole bunch of reasons why it is smart to take your money and seek a better place for it. To avoid leaving you with the wrong impression that I consider Floating Rate preferreds a legitimate investment, I would like to clarify that I do not view them as such. Their credit rating and yield are simply not compatible and are essentially capped by their call price.

              U.S. stocks mostly rose on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 hitting an intraday record on the back of better-than-expected results from bellwether companies, the latest sign that equity valuations may be supported by activity on Wall Street.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.
