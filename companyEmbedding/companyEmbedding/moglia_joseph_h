Board of Directors









Joseph H. Moglia, Chairman

Download Photo

Joe Moglia is the current Chairman of the Board at TD Ameritrade and the head football coach and Chair of Athletics at Coastal Carolina University. In the business world, in 1984, Moglia entered the MBA Training Program at Merrill Lynch where there were 25 MBAs and one football coach. By 1988, he was Merrill Lynch’s Number One Producer in the World. He ultimately had responsibility for Global Fixed Income Institutional Sales, the Municipal Division, Investment Products, the Insurance Company, the 401(k) Business, and Middle Market Business, and he served on the Executive Committee for both the Institutional and Private Client Businesses. He became the CEO of TD Ameritrade in 2001. Over the next seven years, shareholders enjoyed a 500% return as the firm grew its market cap from $700 million to $10 billion, and client assets reached $280 billion. In 2008, after the firm had its sixth record year in a row, Moglia stepped down as CEO and became Chairman of the Board. In his last nine seasons of coaching college football, Moglia has been part of seven championship teams. In his first four seasons at Coastal, he led his team to the National Playoffs four times and three conference championships while being named Conference Coach of the Year twice, as well as AFCA Regional Coach of the Year in 2014 and winner of the prestigious Eddie Robinson Award for National Coach of the Year in 2015. This season will be Moglia’s 25th as a Football Coach, but it’s not a traditional 25 years. He began his career as a coach for 16 years, moved to the business world for over 20, and back to coaching in 2009. In his first stint as a coach, he won two Ivy League Championships as the Defensive Coordinator at Dartmouth, led units that set defense and kicking records at Lafayette, and turned two high school programs around. Before going to Coastal, he was Executive Advisor for Football at Nebraska where he was part of two Holiday Bowls and two Big 12 North Championships. In 2011 he was Head Coach of the Omaha Nighthawks in the United Football League. Moglia has received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and the Sharp Trophy for Leadership. He has been honored by the National Italian American Foundation, the Columbus Citizens Foundation, the South Carolina Football Hall of Fame, and the American Institute for Stuttering. He has been inducted into four Halls of Fame, is the recipient of three Honorary Doctorates and is also the only author to have written books published on both investing and football.

Early career[edit]
Moglia attended Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx from 1963 to 1967. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Fordham University and his master's degree in secondary education from the University of Delaware. He was a football coach for 16 years, finishing as the defensive coordinator at Dartmouth College from 1981 to 1983.
After the 1983 football season ended, Moglia decided to start a second career on Wall Street. Moglia joined a training class at Merrill Lynch with twenty-four MBA graduates.[1]
Business career[edit]
Moglia spent 17 years at Merrill Lynch, where he was a member of the executive committees for both the institutional business and the private client business. Before leaving to take the role of chief executive officer at Ameritrade Holding Corp (now TD Ameritrade) in 2001, he was responsible for all investment products, the insurance company, the 401(k) business and the middle-market business.
In his seven years at TD Ameritrade, Moglia and his executive management team oversaw the company as its client assets grew from $24 billion to over $300 billion, increased its market capitalization from $700 million to $12 billion[2] and produced five consecutive years of record earnings performance. He has also helped the company capitalize on merger and acquisition opportunities, including two of the largest in the discount brokerage industry: Datek Online Holdings in September 2002 and TD Waterhouse in January 2006.[2]
In March 2008, citing the desire to pursue other interests, Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position in the coming fall.[2] A search for his successor took place over the spring and summer. In September 2008, Moglia officially stepped down from his CEO position at TD Ameritrade. Fred Tomczyk, the former COO at TD Bank Financial Group, succeeded him. Not completely leaving the company, Moglia became the new chairman, succeeding J. Joseph Ricketts. It was the first time in the company's history where no member of the Ricketts family was a member of the management team, outside of the few that remain on the board of directors.
Return to coaching[edit]
After stepping down as CEO, Moglia began work as an unpaid voluntary assistant coach/mentor for the University of Nebraska football team under Bo Pelini.[1] Moglia stated at the time that he hoped to coach at the collegiate level.[1] On November 10, 2010, Moglia was named as the head coach of the new United Football League franchise, the Virginia Destroyers. On January 12, 2011, he was then named President and head coach of the Omaha Nighthawks, whose venue was TD Ameritrade Park Omaha.
Moglia signed with Coastal Carolina on December 20, 2011, replacing David Bennett. In his first season with Coastal, he led the team to win the 2012 Big South Conference Championship and was named 2012 Big South Conference Coach of the Year. After the 2015 Big South season, the Chanticleers program began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS football, a higher level of competition. Following the transition period, Coastal Carolina will compete in the Sun Belt Conference.

Early career[edit]
Moglia attended Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx from 1963 to 1967. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Fordham University and his master's degree in secondary education from the University of Delaware. He was a football coach for 16 years, finishing as the defensive coordinator at Dartmouth College from 1981 to 1983.
After the 1983 football season ended, Moglia decided to start a second career on Wall Street. Moglia joined a training class at Merrill Lynch with twenty-four MBA graduates.[1]
Business career[edit]
Moglia spent 17 years at Merrill Lynch, where he was a member of the executive committees for both the institutional business and the private client business. Before leaving to take the role of chief executive officer at Ameritrade Holding Corp (now TD Ameritrade) in 2001, he was responsible for all investment products, the insurance company, the 401(k) business and the middle-market business.
In his seven years at TD Ameritrade, Moglia and his executive management team oversaw the company as its client assets grew from $24 billion to over $300 billion, increased its market capitalization from $700 million to $12 billion[2] and produced five consecutive years of record earnings performance. He has also helped the company capitalize on merger and acquisition opportunities, including two of the largest in the discount brokerage industry: Datek Online Holdings in September 2002 and TD Waterhouse in January 2006.[2]
In March 2008, citing the desire to pursue other interests, Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position in the coming fall.[2] A search for his successor took place over the spring and summer. In September 2008, Moglia officially stepped down from his CEO position at TD Ameritrade. Fred Tomczyk, the former COO at TD Bank Financial Group, succeeded him. Not completely leaving the company, Moglia became the new chairman, succeeding J. Joseph Ricketts. It was the first time in the company's history where no member of the Ricketts family was a member of the management team, outside of the few that remain on the board of directors.
Return to coaching[edit]
After stepping down as CEO, Moglia began work as an unpaid voluntary assistant coach/mentor for the University of Nebraska football team under Bo Pelini.[1] Moglia stated at the time that he hoped to coach at the collegiate level.[1] On November 10, 2010, Moglia was named as the head coach of the new United Football League franchise, the Virginia Destroyers. On January 12, 2011, he was then named President and head coach of the Omaha Nighthawks, whose venue was TD Ameritrade Park Omaha.
Moglia signed with Coastal Carolina on December 20, 2011, replacing David Bennett. In his first season with Coastal, he led the team to win the 2012 Big South Conference Championship and was named 2012 Big South Conference Coach of the Year. After the 2015 Big South season, the Chanticleers program began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS football, a higher level of competition. Following the transition period, Coastal Carolina will compete in the Sun Belt Conference.

On January 12, 2011, he was then named President and head coach of the Omaha Nighthawks, whose venue was TD Ameritrade Park Omaha.
Moglia signed with Coastal Carolina on December 20, 2011, replacing David Bennett. In his first season with Coastal, he led the team to win the 2012 Big South Conference Championship and was named 2012 Big South Conference Coach of the Year. After the 2015 Big South season, the Chanticleers program began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS football, a higher level of competition. Following the transition period, Coastal Carolina will compete in the Sun Belt Conference.

Early career[edit]
Moglia attended Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx from 1963 to 1967. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Fordham University and his master's degree in secondary education from the University of Delaware. He was a football coach for 16 years, finishing as the defensive coordinator at Dartmouth College from 1981 to 1983.
After the 1983 football season ended, Moglia decided to start a second career on Wall Street. Moglia joined a training class at Merrill Lynch with twenty-four MBA graduates.[1]
Business career[edit]
Moglia spent 17 years at Merrill Lynch, where he was a member of the executive committees for both the institutional business and the private client business. Before leaving to take the role of chief executive officer at Ameritrade Holding Corp (now TD Ameritrade) in 2001, he was responsible for all investment products, the insurance company, the 401(k) business and the middle-market business.
In his seven years at TD Ameritrade, Moglia and his executive management team oversaw the company as its client assets grew from $24 billion to over $300 billion, increased its market capitalization from $700 million to $12 billion[2] and produced five consecutive years of record earnings performance. He has also helped the company capitalize on merger and acquisition opportunities, including two of the largest in the discount brokerage industry: Datek Online Holdings in September 2002 and TD Waterhouse in January 2006.[2]
In March 2008, citing the desire to pursue other interests, Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position in the coming fall.[2] A search for his successor took place over the spring and summer. In September 2008, Moglia officially stepped down from his CEO position at TD Ameritrade. Fred Tomczyk, the former COO at TD Bank Financial Group, succeeded him. Not completely leaving the company, Moglia became the new chairman, succeeding J. Joseph Ricketts. It was the first time in the company's history where no member of the Ricketts family was a member of the management team, outside of the few that remain on the board of directors.
Return to coaching[edit]
After stepping down as CEO, Moglia began work as an unpaid voluntary assistant coach/mentor for the University of Nebraska football team under Bo Pelini.[1] Moglia stated at the time that he hoped to coach at the collegiate level.[1] On November 10, 2010, Moglia was named as the head coach of the new United Football League franchise, the Virginia Destroyers. On January 12, 2011, he was then named President and head coach of the Omaha Nighthawks, whose venue was TD Ameritrade Park Omaha.
Moglia signed with Coastal Carolina on December 20, 2011, replacing David Bennett. In his first season with Coastal, he led the team to win the 2012 Big South Conference Championship and was named 2012 Big South Conference Coach of the Year. After the 2015 Big South season, the Chanticleers program began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS football, a higher level of competition. Following the transition period, Coastal Carolina will compete in the Sun Belt Conference.

Private Sector; A Cool Head for 4th and Long

WHEN Joseph H. Moglia landed his first job on Wall Street 19 years ago, he was 34, the father of four young children and the only sales trainee in his group at Merrill Lynch without an M.B.A.A former college football coach, Mr. Moglia became the No. 1 institutional sales representative in his fourth year at Merrill. Later, he became the youngest senior vice president and the head of all investment products in the private-client division. He said he had expected to stay at the firm until he retired.But when he was chosen as the chief executive of a struggling online trading firm, Ameritrade Holding, during one of the worst stock market slumps in decades, he said he could not pass up the challenge.''Had things not been as bad as they were, they might not have been interested in me; I felt that this was an incredible challenge,'' said Mr. Moglia, who took over as chief from Ameritrade's founder and chairman, J. Joe Ricketts, in March 2001.

Mr. Moglia had built a reputation as a turnaround specialist, both as a coach and as a businessman, but he had his work cut out for him at Ameritrade, a money-losing venture that many analysts predicted would not survive. Continue reading the main story

Now, nearly two years into the job, Mr. Moglia, at 53, is praised for turning around Ameritrade while rival online brokers, like the E*Trade Group, are floundering. ''The company has responded extremely well to Joe Moglia's leadership,'' said Richard H. Repetto, an analyst at Putnam Lovell NBF Securities.Unlike E*Trade, which diversified into banking, Ameritrade has remained an online brokerage firm. Mr. Moglia's strategy has been to add heft by acquiring rivals, paying $154 million in stock for National Discount Brokers in September 2001, for example, and $1.3 billion in stock for Datek Online last September.At the same time, he reduced costs and cut the company's bank debt nearly to zero. Even if the average number of daily trades fell by one-third, Ameritrade would still break even, Mr. Moglia said.The company, which lost $29 million on sales of $431 million in the fiscal year ended last September, is projecting a profit for fiscal 2003 -- its first full-year profit since 1999. For the last quarter, Ameritrade had net income of $22 million, a record, on sales of $181 million.Charles Schwab, by contrast, lost $79 million in the fourth quarter on sales of $996 million. E*Trade earned $30 million on sales of $349 million, but it warned that this quarter's operating earnings would be 20 percent below the fourth quarter's.Though Schwab has $765 billion in customer accounts -- 20 times Ameritrade's $37 billion -- Ameritrade is adding accounts faster. In the last two years, its account base grew 30 percent, not including acquisitions, compared with 6 percent for Schwab and 15 percent for E*Trade, according to Putnam Lovell.Mr. Moglia is not afraid to play rough with competitors. Ameritrade announced in full-page national newspaper ads on Thursday that it would pay up to $50 to each investor willing to switch at least $10,000 to an Ameritrade account.

But even supporters say Ameritrade and other online brokerage firms are facing a tough contest in a weak economy. ''Joe's challenge will be the viability of the online business model and not his ability to run the business,'' said David H. Komansky, the chairman of Merrill Lynch.

Mr. Moglia said he thrived on such challenges. When he was at Merrill, for example, Mr. Komansky, then the head of institutional sales, asked him to take over the municipal bond division after Orange County, Calif., filed the largest municipal bankruptcy ever. The county had lost billions on risky investments recommended by Merrill. When Mr. Moglia left three years later, the division was generating more profit per employee than any other in the firm.''Joe is fearless,'' Mr. Komansky said. ''He went into a very different business and in short order became proficient at it and really turned around and energized the unit. A lot of people can accept new assignments within their range of experience, but far fewer people can go outside their expertise and excel like that.''Mr. Moglia, the oldest of five children, grew up in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in Washington Heights in Manhattan. His mother was a homemaker until her children were adults, and his father owned a fruit store in the neighborhood.''Watching how hard my father worked gave me an incredible sense of responsibility but also taught me how important it was for me to finish school and do something I enjoyed,'' Mr. Moglia said. He said he had worked long hours at the fruit store throughout high school, at Fordham Prep, and then in college, at Fordham University in the Bronx, where he earned a degree in economics.A football and baseball player in high school, he switched to coaching at college because he was married and a father by the time he was 19. While he was still a sophomore at Fordham University, he persuaded Fordham Prep to hire him as an assistant football coach.Though his interest in Wall Street grew while studying economics in college, Mr. Moglia truly enjoyed coaching. After graduation, he applied to more than 100 high schools and was offered a head coaching position at only one, Archmere Academy, a boys' prep school in Delaware where the football team had won only three games in the previous three years. In his final season, four years later, Archmere had a record of 8-1.Mr. Moglia eventually moved on to college football at Lafayette and then Dartmouth, as defensive coordinator, where his team won Ivy League championships in 1981 and 1982. But the 90-hour workweeks and travel were too taxing. ''I loved what I was doing, and I was good at it,'' he said. ''But after 15 years' coaching, I wondered if the sacrifice I and my family were making was worth it.''He applied for the Merrill training program and quickly worked his way up at the firm.Mr. Moglia married Amy Jardine, an artist, eight years ago and has two teenage stepsons, and he is close to his four adult children from his first marriage.

He said he saw many parallels in coaching and running a business. Maintaining communication and building a strong team are vital to success in both, he said. To that end, he meets with Ameritrade's 2,000 employees every few weeks.His message: ''We know that one day there's going to be a good market, but we'll be even tougher on ourselves then. We're going to be the best there is.''Tom Olivadotti, the linebacker coach for the New York Giants, has known Mr. Moglia since both coached high school teams and said: ''You have to be a team builder and motivate people to win. Joe does that.'' Continue reading the main story
